Yup.  I hope [1/3] and [2/3] weren't urgent?  Due to a horrid merge
mismatchmishmashmess I've staged them behind lots of other things,
notably

thp/khugepaged improvements and CoW semantics
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200416160026.16538-1-kirill.shutemov@linux.intel.com

and mm: memcontrol: charge swapin pages on instantiation
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200508183105.225460-1-hannes@cmpxchg.org

and mm: balance LRU lists based on relative thrashing
