Of course I missed few things here.

- I didn't realize that cpufreq_get_hw_max_freq() is defined weak :(

  I understand that we want to support everything that is possible,
  but there is no need to support cases which we may never have
  actually. We have seen code going in the kernel, which no one ever
  ends up using.

  Do we see a case in near future where someone is going to override
  this weak implementation ? If we don't have an actual target for it
  at the moment, then we should probably remove the weak attribute and
  simplify the code.

- I understood earlier that, we don't pick up AMU support unless all
  CPUs of a policy are supported by AMUs, but forgot that later while
  writing the patch. What is the thing with AMUs? Why would some
  platform add it only for some CPUs out of a policy ? Do we have such
  platforms already or in queue ?

Lets discuss more after we have settled on the first point here.

Thanks for review Ionela.
