Again, they should not be, as classes are not what a driver creates.  It
is what a subsystem creates, as a class is a type of common devices that
all talk to userspace in the same way.

Again, there is nothing to "fix" here as there is no code in the kernel
tree today calling this api with a class name that is not static.

If we have code that does need to do this, and it is submitted for
merging, and I agree with how it is creating the class names, I will be
glad to take a patch at that time to make this change.  Until then, this
is just added complexity for no benefit at all.
