Right, my patches will only affect the code paths where kgdb sets
software breakpoints.

In principle h/w breakpoints, whether they are code or data, should be
able to rely on hw_breakpoint_arch_parse() and any errors from the hw
breakpoint API will propagate into the kgdb core and do the right
thing.

In practice it looks like kgdb/x86/hw_breakpoint have plumbed together
in a manner that circumvents the parse (and therefore#
arch_build_bp_info() never runs). Rather the h/w/ break problem using
the kprobe blacklist I think we could just fix these code paths.

The following is 100% untested (not even compile) and I copied a line
or two from register_perf_hw_breakpoint() without checking what they
do ;-). Nevertheless I hope it gives a clear idea about what I am
talking about! If this was developed into a "real" patch then I think
dbg_release_bp_slot() should perhaps be replaced with a better API that
doesn't bypass the checks rather than solving everything in kgdb.c .


Daniel.
