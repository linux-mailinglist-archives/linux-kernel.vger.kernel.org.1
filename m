I remember reading something similar before.
I also remember a very old gcc (2.95?) that did a readback
after every volatile write on sparc (to flush the store buffer).
That broke everything.

I suspect there is a lot more code that is attempting to be lockless
these days.
Ring buffers (one writer and one reader) are a typical example where
you don't need locks but do need to use a consistent value.

Now you may also need ordering between accesses - which I think needs
more than volatile.

The cost of volatile accesses is probably minimal unless the
code is written assuming the compiler will only access things once.

More like shorter code lines :-)
