I'm well aware about that model and that the research is focussed on
this.

No disagreement here.

The problem is that this has spread out. And it's not only Graphene.

As at least two different incarnations originate from Intel written by
two different Intel people, it's really on Intel to get the message out
that enabling FSGSBASE behind the kernels back is a horrible idea.

You surely are not responsible. It's definitely Intel's fault.

I understand that and with a big fat warning and documentation from
start I wouldn't have complained so vehemently.

As one of the X86 maintainers I have to say that we were perfectly
willing to merge FSGSBASE even without the SGX background. There are
perfect other reasons to do so.

Fair enough.

Sorry for that innuendo. Now that my anger and general frustration about
this whole disaster have calmed down, I surely would not write that
again.

Thanks,
