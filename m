Glad it helped!  With some luck, perhaps it will improve with time...

Right now the restriction is that single-argument (AKA can_sleep==true)
kvfree_rcu() cannot be invoked from memory reclaim context.

But would adding __GFP_NOMEMALLOC to the can_sleep==true GFP_ flags
allow us to remove this restriction?  If so, I will queue a separate
patch making this change.  The improved ease of use would be well
worth it, if I understand correctly (ha!!!).

OK, in the short term, both work, but I have queued a separate patch
making this change and recording the tradeoffs.  This is not yet a
promise to push this patch, but it is a promise not to lose this part
of the picture.  Please see below.

You mentioned alloc_pages().  I reverted to __get_free_pages(), but
alloc_pages() of course looks nicer.  What are the tradeoffs between
__get_free_pages() and alloc_pages()?

							Thanx, Paul

commit 490b638d7c241ac06cee168ccf8688bb8b872478
Author: Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@kernel.org>
Date:   Wed Sep 30 16:16:39 2020 -0700

    kvfree_rcu(): Switch from kmalloc/kfree to __get_free_page/free_page.
    
    The advantages of using kmalloc() and kfree() are a possible small speedup
    on CONFIG_SLAB=y systems, avoiding the allocation-side cast, and use of
    more-familiar API members.  The advantages of using __get_free_page()
    and free_page() are a possible reduction in fragmentation and direct
    access to the buddy allocator.
    
    To help settle the question as to which to use, this commit switches
    from kmalloc() and kfree() to __get_free_page() and free_page().
