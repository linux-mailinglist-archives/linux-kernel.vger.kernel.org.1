... and that is a very valid concern too IMO.

However, the way we see it, as things stand today, we don't even know what
goes into Linux on all android phones out there. We know what we add, as part
of the AOSP kernel, however, what actually runs on the device is normally
about a million lines of code changes on top of what we do.

So, for the GKI parts, we are doing the following

1. Making the peripheral drivers modules also means the GKI must have all the
core framework changes built-in. This gets us the list of core kernel changes
that ship on Android devices so we can work on upstreaming them OR find the
appropriate alternative. For Android, that answers the canonical
- "Where is the use case?" question coming from anyone.

You can see the list of these out-of-tree changes is growing by the day in
AOSP right now[1]. Its there for everyone to find in exactly *one place*.
Note that, almost all of those patches have been posted on the list already.
That's the first pre-requisite for any change that goes into AOSP kernel[2].

2. Once we have a core kernel that *truly* works on all Android devices, we
will have built up list of changes we want to upstream (or anyone can pick
them from our public tree). Android will still continue to move to newer
kernel versions easily (may be at a difference cadence ..)

3. About the incentive for upstream SoC support: As part of GKI, we are not
promising a forever stable kernel<->module interface. We still change it each
year. The *best way* for anyone to have their SoC / peripheral supported is
_still_ "going upstream". In fact, we advertise it as such[2]. The modularity
aspect just brings a much needed flexibility for execution.  The flexibility
is needed given the number of stakeholders involved just in the kernel as of
today. (Its a mix of Upstream, Google, SoC manufacturer, device maker and
many other small parts).


4. We also haven't been so keen on the "unloading" of a module. We know there
were subsystems where unloading may not work as expected. Then again, to my
knowledge, nobody has been stress testing with 500+ different modules that
register to all core frameworks being loaded and unloaded at random times.
Even if someone did, we just didn't think its worth the hassle or time at
this moment. Unloading the module didn't buy us anything. (Although, I do get
the point about "correctness"  -- so it shouldn't also be obviously broken)
