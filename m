(on lore: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/AM6PR03MB51700577CF9EF4972FDE568AE4CB0@AM6PR03MB5170.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com/)

I mean - I guess that kinda works? It'll mean that attaching to a task
with "strace" as root won't work reliably if the task is in the middle
of execve though, there'll be a weird race where if strace first
attaches to a sibling and then tries to attach to the thread going
through execve(), it'll fail to attach to that thread, and then lose
the process entirely once de_thread() has killed off the other
threads. My perfectionist side is somewhat irked by that.

Still, it's probably far better than Linus' "simpler change" where the
target just gets killed off if someone tries to trace it at the wrong
time.
