Could it be a bad merge or patch applied twice or something? I don't
see how the symbol is being exported twice. The argument to revert the
patch still seems correct.

Looking at current linux-next, ba722ca780 from akpm is re-adding the
patch after it gets reverted. Andrew, could you drop your copy of this
patch? It's already upstream as of 5.8-rc1 and now just needs to be
reverted upstream.
