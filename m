Ah, you meant schema.  Yes, I know what that is, I just didn't
connect the two from the description above.

Exactly.

That's okay, I don't mind discussing.

Ironically, the 'ab8500-pwm' is a good example of a false positive,
since it's fine for the DT nodes to be identical.  So long as there
are nodes present for each instance, it doesn't matter which one is
allocated to which device.  Forcing a 'reg' property onto them for no
good reason it not a valid solution here.

No it doesn't.  In the case of 'ab8500-pwm' the OF node is not set for
2 of the devices and warnings are presented in the kernel log.  The
device will continue to probe and function as usual.

I did [0].  You must have missed it. :)

It also suffers with false positives.
