I see multiple questions here.

First of all, unless I'm mistaken, the attributes set here are static
properties, set by the PHY driver at probe time, and only read by PHY
consumers. There should be no need for any kind of protection or special
API to access them.

Then, there's the question of how to handle dynamic attributes. In
theory a dynamic attribute could be changed at any time, and thus race
wit, for instance phy_power_on(). However, the proposed API won't help
much address this issue. Using a mutex will indeed ensure that the
attribute change will be serialized with other operations, but it won't
give any guarantee to the PHY consumer on whether the attribute will be
set before or after phy_power_on() is processed. The consumer will not
know if the new value of the attribute has been taken into account.

The question is thus whether we want to make the PHY consumer API
thread-safe (note that due to the usage of a mutex, we don't support
calling most of the API functions from an interrupt handler, so it
really requires the consumer to use a work queue, a thread, or possibly
a threaded interrupt). If the answer is yes, the API should define what
use cases are valid, and how the PHY has to behave. This includes
documenting when new attribute values can be set, and when they are
taken into account. If we had to document this as part of this patch
series, we would have to state that the new values are taken into
account at an undefined point of time if the attribute set call is
concurrent with other API calls, which makes the API ill-defined in my
opinion. I expect that we would need to turn attribute setting into a
callback to the PHY driver in that case, or at least make it a more
complex operation handled by the PHY core that would use the existing
PHY ops to reconfigure the PHY.

Is it worth it allowing drivers to call the PHY API from different
threads as opposed to requiring consumers to serialize calls if their
use cases require so ? I would expect most consumers to only try to
reconfigure a PHY when it's stopped, or to manually stop, reconfigure
and restart the PHY.

If the answer to the above question is that a thread-safe API isn't
worth it as we wouldn't have good use cases for it, then I think
accessing the attributes manually is all we need.
