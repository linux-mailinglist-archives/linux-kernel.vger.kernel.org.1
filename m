Understood. Will do.

The patches are originally from 2019. I'll update everything.

Yes. The memory is integrated and the size depends on the specific chips
so the memory node is at the chip level dtsi and not the board level.

The specific nodes will go into there. This is mostly an artefact of splitt=
ing
the device trees out of a more developed tree.

In my tree with drivers for the rest of the hardware it hasn't been a probl=
em.
So far I've found infinity, infinity2, infinity3, infinity5 and
infinity6 chips. The memory
map for them is almost identical and the changes are adding in more
copies of things
like DMA controllers, extra clock blocks etc.

Having infinity.dtsi as the base for the newer versions should avoid
having duplication
of nodes that aren't common on the mstar armv7 level but are common to
the infinity subtypes.

There are two good examples of this:
For infinity? the USB and SD controllers are at the same place for all
of the chips I've
found so far. Unfortunately, despite using the same IP block and the
same driver those
blocks are in different places in the mercury5. At the moment with all
of the infinity chips
pulling in infinity.dtsi those nodes are only in infinity.dtsi and
mercury5.dtsi.
If infinity?.dtsi are all stacked on top of the mstarv7.dtsi base then
there will be a number of
copies of the same nodes.

I have been thinking about that. I didn't see any other dts in arm that had
the vendor as a prefix though. With arm64 everything is in per vendor
subdirectories
to achieve the same thing.

Everything so far has been reverse engineered from an old 3.18
kernel, poking with a multimeter etc. I wish I had a decent manual.

There is a bridge that is between the CPU and the peripheral registers
that doesn't quite fit simple-bus (from what I remember it needs a clk).
My plan was to introduce the thin driver for that bus (it just consumes the=
 clks
it needs so they don't get disabled at the moment) after introducing
the clk support.

Thanks,
