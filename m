The sideband pins from the connector go to multiple places or the
sideband signal from a controller go to multiple connectors? Either
way, that's solved with multiple endpoints. In the former case, port@2
would have multiple endpoints with all the possible connections. The
general model of the graph is each port is a separate data channel and
multiple endpoints are either a mux or fanout depending on the data
direction.

I guess you are referring to the 4 SS signal pairs and that they could
be 2 USB links, 1 USB link and 1-2 Alt mode links, or 4 Alt mode
links. I think the grouping of SS signals is fine as I'd expect
there's a single entity deciding the routing. That would be 'mux' node
I think, but 'mux' is the wrong abstraction here. I guess we could
have 4 muxes (1 for each signal), but I'd hope we don't need that
level of detail in DT. I think we're in agreement on that.

I assume for IRQs you are referring to cases where we have a variable
number such as 'interrupts = <1 2 3>;' where 'interrupts = <1 3>'
doesn't work because we can't describe interrupt 2 is not present? The
graph binding doesn't suffer from that issue since we can easily omit
port or endpoint nodes.

Also, the numbering is specific to a compatible string. If we need
different numbering, then we can do a new compatible.
