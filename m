Looks the tagset depth is a bit low.

Another candidate solution may be to always return true from hctx_may_queue()
for this kind of queue because queue_depth has provided fair allocation for
each LUN, and looks not necessary to do that again.

BTW, I just observe sg_io on rhel8 & rhel7 on mpath over scsi_debug, looks not
see any such activity.

If it is done by mpath at default setting, I think it can be thought as
one common case.
