Sure, checking the pointer before calling was implied, but the 
tracepoint is a good argument, I'd forgotten about that :)

But that's not what this is; this is (supposed to be) the exact same 
"don't actually perform the attach yet" logic as before, just 
restricting it to default domains in the one place that it actually 
needs to be, so as not to fundamentally bugger up iommu_attach_device() 
in a way that prevents it from working as expected at the correct point 
later.

Thinking a bit more, consider if the driver resets the device then 
attaches it straight to its own unmanaged domain rather than calling any 
DMA ops (e.g. VFIO?) - it looks like that would also be totally broken 
right now, and no amount of bodges in iommu-dma is going to help there.

Robin.
