While I think I understand what the intended semantics are, the
description in the previous paragraph feels off, so that if 
this whole text lands in a commit message (or a manual page),
I think it needs fixing.

Firs, it seems odd to say that 

   "setns(nsfd, CLONE_NEWNET) equals setns(pidfd, CLONE_NEWNET)"

setns(nsfd, CLONE_NEWNET) means: fail if nsfd does not refer to a
network namespace.

setns(pidfd, CLONE_NEWNET) means: move into just the network
namespace of the process referred to by 'pidfd'.

I would not call those two things "equal", in a semantic sense.

And then:

If I understand right, setns(pidfd, 0) would mean: move into
all of the same namespaces as the process referred to by 'pidfd'.

But setns(nsfd, 0) means: move into whatever kind of namespace
is referred to by 'nsfd'.

I would not say of these two cases that 0 is interpreted
in the same way.

Hopefully I have not misunderstood.

That does seem like a win. Thanks for working on this!

Cheers,
