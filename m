... and I've sliced out everything except that in this reply.

When the brightness-levels array is not present then backlight
brightness and led brightness have a 1:1 mapping. In this case the
meaning of "default brightness level" is (hopefully) obvious and the
parenthetic text does not apply.

When the array is present then we have two different scales of
brightness and it is important to describe which scale we use for the
default brightness. The language about "index into" was adopted to avoid
having to introduce extra terminology whilst making it clear that
setting the default brightness-level to 128 is invalid (because it is
not an acceptable index) and that a value of 6 will result in the LED
brightness being set to 128.

That had me worried for a moment but I think the code and bindings are
in agreement.

There is some code to map the LED scale (128) to the backlight scale (6)
but this used to ensure we supply the correct brightness level to user
space when an active backlight is handed over from bootloader to kernel.

If a default-brightness-level is provided then the above logic is
overridden and the value read from the DT gets placed directly into
props.brightness where it will act as in index into the brightness
table.
