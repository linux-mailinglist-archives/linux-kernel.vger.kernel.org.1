NP, I don't have bandwidth to work on it right now either.

Does that mean you are using inline_data with 256-byte inodes?  That would
also be good to know, since there haven't been any well-known users of
this feature so far (AFAIK).  Since you are using this in a read-only
manner, you won't hit the one know issue when an inline_data inode is
extended to use an external block that may temporarily leave the inode
in an inconsistent state.

Cheers, Andreas
