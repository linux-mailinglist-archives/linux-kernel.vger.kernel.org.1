Yes, Grsecurity is making good money.
They simply added a no-redistribution agreement to their patch of the 
Linux Kernel.

The FSF, Software Freedom Conservancy, and the Corporate Linux Kernel 
Developers all agree that this is fine (silence is consent).

Contributors should blanket-revoke their contributions from all 
free-takers since they didn't agree to BSD-in-Practice. They should also 
claw-back any transferred copyrights from the FSF using the 30 year 
clawback provision in the US Copyright Act. Design of how a program 
works is a copyrightable aspect (Ex: How RMS designed GCC 30 years ago 
or so etc)

Had to repost this because the linux admins deleted the email:

Grsecurity GPL Violations: Bring a CASE act claim every time GrSecurity 
releases a new infringing work?

     (GRSecurity blatantly violates the clause in the Linux kernel and 
GCC copyright licenses regarding adding addtional terms between the 
licensee of the kernel / gcc and furthur down-the-line licensees, 
regarding derivative works)
     (The linux kernel has 1000s of copyright holders)
     (All who shake at the knees at the thought of initiating a federal 
Copyright lawsuit)
