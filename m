I think it would be useful to add to the x86 boot documentation how
exactly this new entry point is called, even if it's just adding a link
to some section of those specs. The doc should also say that an
mle_header_offset of 0 means the kernel isn't secure launch enabled.

You should see them if you do
	readelf -r arch/x86/boot/compressed/vmlinux

In terms of the code, things like:

	addl    %ebx, (sl_gdt_desc + 2)(%ebx)

will create a relocation, because the linker interprets this as wanting
the runtime address of sl_gdt_desc, rather than just the offset from
startup_32.

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git/tree/arch/x86/boot/compressed/head_64.S#n48

has a comment with some explanation and a macro that the 32-bit code in
startup_32 uses to avoid creating relocations.

Since the SL code is in a different assembler file (and a different
section), you can't directly use the same macro. I would suggest getting
rid of sl_stub_entry and entering directly at sl_stub, and then the code
in sl_stub.S can use sl_stub for the base address, defining the rva()
macro there as

	#define rva(X) ((X) - sl_stub)

You will also need to avoid initializing data with symbol addresses.

	.long mle_header
	.long sl_stub_entry
	.long sl_gdt

will create relocations. The third one is easy, just replace it with
sl_gdt - sl_gdt_desc and initialize it at runtime with

	leal	rva(sl_gdt_desc)(%ebx), %eax
	addl	%eax, 2(%eax)
	lgdt	(%eax)

The other two are more messy, unfortunately there is no easy way to tell
the linker what we want here. The other entry point addresses (for the
EFI stub) are populated in a post-processing step after the compressed
kernel has been linked, we could teach it to also update kernel_info.

Without that, for kernel_info, you could change it to store the offset
of the MLE header from kernel_info, instead of from the start of the
image.

For the MLE header, it could be moved to .head.text in head_64.S, and
initialized with
	.long rva(sl_stub)
This will also let it be placed at a fixed offset from startup_32, so
that kernel_info can just be populated with a constant.
