You may have a valid point. But if we do your suggestion of just
punting in this path and use a full timestamp, then there's nothing to
worry about here. Right?

Ah, that needs better wording: "An interrupt of this event could have
written to the write_stamp before this interrupt wrote to it. Which
means this event could have made the write_stamp go backwards. Need to
put back the write stamp using the before stamp, as that can only be
updated by events that interrupt this current one."

local64_cmpxchg(), I left it out of change log, as this is the
algorithm not all the details. See the patch for those ;-)

We are just fixing up this events write into write_stamp. We only worry
about being interrupted between C and D, as then we set the write stamp
backward. But any interrupting event will also update the before time
stamp. That is, the before_stamp can only be the last time stamp of an
event that interrupted us here. By doing the cmpxchg, we only update
the write stamp to the before stamp of the last event to interrupt this
event and if the cmpxchg fails, that means another event came in and
updated it to its own time stamp which is what we want it to be!

Because the current time stamp is wrong.

This is what happened:

	nesting 0							    nesting 1
	---------							    ---------
        < start event 1 >
 [A]	w = local_read(write_tail);
	ts = clock(); [ time 1 ]

 									< start event 2 >
									    ts = clock(); [ time 2 ]
									[C] write = local_add_return();
									<finish>

 [C]	write = local_add_return();

									< start event 3 >
									    ts = clock(); [ time 3]
									[C] write = local_add_return();
									<finish>


 [F]	if (write == local_read(write_tail) && after < temp_ts) {

	} else {

The recorded time stamps are this:

   time 1 < time 2 < time 3

The buffer would look like this:

  ----+------------------+------------------+------------------+----
  ... | time 2 : event 2 | time ? : event 1 | time 3 : event 3 | ...
  ----+------------------+------------------+------------------+----


What do you put in for event 1's time. It's time stamp is before time
2, but the recorded event is after event 2. We can't use event 3 as a
time.

But in this case, it really doesn't matter in practice. Why? because
what is the time of that middle event? How is that useful information?

For example, you record a syscall event.



 syscall() {
 	[...]

 +	trace_syscall() {
 |		< event 1 >
 |			-------------> [interrupt]
 |				 	 < event 2 >
 |					 < time 2 >
 |			<------------
 |		< time 1>
 |			-------------> [interrupt]
 |				 	 < event 3 >
 |					 < time 3 >
 |			<------------
 +	}

	[...]
}

What's the difference if event 1's time stamp is time 2 or time 3?
The event that it is representing is paused for that entire path.

It's not really useful to get that "exact" because there's no real
meaning of what that "exact" is. The vertical line there is the call to
record a trace event. The event that is being represented by the trace
event is paused for all three time stamps.
