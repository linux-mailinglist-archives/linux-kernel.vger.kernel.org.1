It should be much less work now that the vast majority of=20
arch/mips/jz4740 is gone. The code left is pretty much generic. I can=20
have a look to convert it to the MIPS_GENERIC framework.

Although the code there is scary. Have a look at=20
arch/mips/include/asm/{machine,mips_machine}.h, you'll see what I mean.

Anyway, I think we're way past the scope of this patch, so for this one:
