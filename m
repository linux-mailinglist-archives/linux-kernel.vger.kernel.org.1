Ok, so the idea is that "housekeeping" CPUs are to be used for general purpose configuration, and thus is a subset of online CPUs. By reducing the limit to just housekeeping CPUs, we ensure that we do not overload the system with more queues than can be handled by the general purpose CPUs?

Thanks,
