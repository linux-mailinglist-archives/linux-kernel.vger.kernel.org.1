Not mentioned the time lost by compiling and properly manage my own toolchain in an automated environment, using such new version of compilers means that I have to inevitably deal with compiler bugs occasionally. Anyway, it is just some other more bugs I have to deal with, and I donâ€™t have a better solution to offer right now.

Hi Qian,

Shameless plug but I have made a Python script to efficiently configure
then build clang specifically for building the kernel (turn off a lot of
different things that the kernel does not need).

https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/tc-build

I added an option '--use-good-revision', which uses an older master
version (basically somewhere between clang-10 and current master) that
has been qualified against the kernel. I currently update it every
Linux release but I am probably going to start doing it every month as
I have written a pretty decent framework to ensure that nothing is
breaking on either the LLVM or kernel side.

$ ./build-llvm.py --use-good-revision

should be all you need to get off the ground and running if you wanted
to give it a shot. The script is completely self contained by default so
it won't mess with the rest of your system. Additionally, leaving off
'--use-good-revision' will just use the master branch, which can
definitely be broken but not as often as you would think (although I
totally understand wanting to focus on kernel regressions only).

Cheers,
Nathan
