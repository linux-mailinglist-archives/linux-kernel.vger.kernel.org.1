The ETM trace protocol has in built TraceID to distinguish the packets
and thus we could decode the trace streams from the shared buffer.
[ But, we don't have buffer overflow interrupts (I am keeping the lid 
closed on that can, for the sake of keeping sanity ;-) ), and thus
any shared session could easily loose data unless we tune the AUX
buffer size to a really large buffer ].

Right. If we can't get the sink, we simply truncate the buffer.

That ship has sailed. That is how the current generation of systems are,
unfortunately. But as I said, this is changing and there are guidelines
in place to avoid these kind of topologies. With the future
technologies, this will be completely gone.

True, until then, this is the best we could do.
