That looks like IRQD_IRQ_STARTED not being set in this case.

Not great indeed. But this is not, as far as I can tell, a GIC
driver problem.

The semantic of activate/deactivate (which maps to started/shutdown
in the IRQ code) is that the HW resources for a given interrupt are
only committed when the interrupt is activated. Trying to perform
actions involving the HW on an interrupt that isn't active cannot be
guaranteed to take effect.

I'd rather address it in the core code, by preventing set_affinity (and
potentially others) to take place when the interrupt is not in the
STARTED state. Userspace would get an error, which is perfectly
legitimate, and which it already has to deal with it for plenty of other
reasons.

I believe this is only an artefact of these other controllers not
requiring any resource to be committed into the HW (SPIs wouldn't care,
for example).
