It is up to you.  In the future, you may want to distinguish devices that
have this problem from ones that do not.

If you are not sure it is the ISSI eMMC, and maybe not the host controller,
then might it be the board?  Perhaps make SDHCI_QUIRK2_HOST_NO_CMD23
conditional on the particular compatibility string?

At a minimum, change the "/* Card quirk */" comment to a fuller explanation.
