Yeah, forcing *all* PMUs owned by a driver to be affine to the same CPU 
is another way to go about it, however it slightly penalises systems 
that are wired up sensibly and *would* otherwise be able to distribute 
non-shared affinities around in a balanced manner (optimising the 
initial pmu->cpu selection in the face of NUMA is an exercise still on 
the table in some cases).

And we'd still have to have all the "has another instance already 
requested this IRQ or not yet?" logic (the general condition is "1 <= 
number of IRQs <= number of PMUs"), plus some way for the global 
affinity to migrate all the PMU contexts and IRQs at once in a 
controlled and race-free manner, so things wouldn't be *massively* 
simpler even then.

Robin.
