We came up with a patch to do this as well. Currently testing it more and it
looks clean, will share it soon.

The L1TF incompleteness is because of cross-HT attack from Guest vCPU
attacker to an interrupt/softirq executing on the other sibling correct? The
IRQ enter pausing the other sibling should fix that (which we will share in
a future series revision after adequate testing).

For ChromeOS we're planning to tag each and every task seperately except for
trusted processes, so we are isolating untrusted tasks even from each other.

Sorry if this sounds like pushing my usecase, but we do get parallelism
advantage for the trusted tasks while still solving all security issues (for
ChromeOS). I agree that cross-HT user <-> kernel MDS is still an issue if
untrusted (tagged) tasks execute together on same core, but we are not
planning to do that on our setup at least.

AIUI, the performance improves vs noht in the recent series. I am told that
is the case in recent postings of the series.

thanks,
