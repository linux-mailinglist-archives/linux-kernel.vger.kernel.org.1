I am sorry, my bad. I already applied this one and 3/4 (dts).
Apparently I forgot to reply with confirmation and Patchwork did not
notify you for some reason.

Patch 2/4 does not look like one for me so I would need ack from
Russell to take. Did you submit it to the ARM patches queue?
Patch 4/4 will wait for v5.10-rc1 as it depends on 1/4 and it is DTS patch.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
