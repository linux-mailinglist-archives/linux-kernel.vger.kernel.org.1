The "not seeing a motivation for this" is a suprising argument to me to
which I honestly can only respond that I don't see a motivation for not
doing this. It unifies and simplifies code and removes variance.

There can't be performance differences between kref and refcount_t since
kref is implemented on top of refcount_t. All functions that Kirill is
replacing are static inline wrappers around refcount_t helpers.

I have no idea why it is wrong talking about reference counts just
because something can have multiple counters or reference counters.

Another way of looking at this is that this patchset removes maintenance
by moving the shared parts of reference counting into a single place.
They are literally shared across all namespaces. I don't see a specific
worry other than the very hand wavy "if we ever have to change something
we have to update the whole generic infrastructure". That could be used
to shoot down 30 cleanup patchsets each development cycle that
significantly contribute to code legibility and maintenance. This is
also how it should work and one of the great benefits of the namespace
infra along with other parts of the kernel is that it is nice and
generic.

If you have issues with the patch descriptions than I'm sure Kirill will
be happy to adapt them to include more detail. If he can't I'm happy to.

Since past experience tells me that we're unlikely to settle this
dispute let's bring in a few more people to take a look at this.
