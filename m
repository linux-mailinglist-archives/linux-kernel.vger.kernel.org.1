So I've looked this over, applied it, looked at how the output changes,
and generally put an untoward amount of effort into finding something to
grumble about.

I failed.

This is a great change - thanks for stepping up and doing it!

As Randy pointed out, the documentation in question is obsolete and
incorrect anyway; there's really not much that can be done in the docs
build system to fix *that*.  I'm not going to worry about this particular
glitch.  If you felt so inspired, a patch to the SCSI maintainers just
removing that paragraph might be well received.

I'm going to go ahead and push this out to linux-next; we'll see if
anything explodes from there.

Thanks,

jon
