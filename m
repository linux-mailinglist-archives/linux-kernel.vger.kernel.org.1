Andrew, I've noticed that this buggy
mm-compaction-avoid-vm_bug_onpageslab-in-page_mapcount.patch
was still in Friday's mmotm 2020-05-29-16-09, despite its replacement
6988f31d558a ("mm: remove VM_BUG_ON(PageSlab()) from page_mapcount()")
getting into 5.7, thanks to your "incoming" to Linus on that day.

Please be sure to remove this patch to mm/compaction.c from your tree
and queue to Linus for 5.8: it imposes an unintended and significant
limitation on the current behavior of compaction. (And in some loads,
some of that additional limitation may actually be beneficial: but if
so, must be argued separately, not as page_mapcount BUG avoidance).

Cc'ing Alex Shi, because I noticed this when trying his v11 per-memcg
lru_lock series (which appears to be a big improvement over earlier
versions, thanks in particular to Johannes's memcg swap simplifications);
and Alex's 12/16 makes a change on top of Konstantin's latter check,
which will now just be reverted. I'm not yet confident in Alex's
isolate_migratepages_block(), in part because this muddle.

Thanks,
Hugh
