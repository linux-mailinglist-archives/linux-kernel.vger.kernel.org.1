You mentioned precompiled headers last time as well, but you haven't
demonstrated that using those is either feasible or advantageous - and
if at some distant future time it turns out that they are a good idea,
it's not really any more difficult at that time to do a
linux/kitchen_sink.h that includes whatever common set of headers seems
to provide a reasonable speedup.

Meanwhile, the sheer size of the headers that gets pulled into each and
every TU currently slows down the build:

https://wildmoose.dk/header-bloat/

so anything that reduces the size of common headers like kernel.h will
improve build times (the slowdown is "death by a thousand cuts", hence
so will any individual improvement be hard or impossible to measure by
itself - that doesn't mean it's not worth doing them). Of course, the
include of minmax.h (et al) from kernel.h must be removed, but that's
the kind of thing that can easily take a couple of cycles to get done,
unlike the damage that adding #include <linux/foo.h> to bar.h
immediately causes.

No. Please no.

What? People duplicate functionality because they're not aware it
already exists, forcing an #include of a declaration of some function
doesn't make any developer know about it.
