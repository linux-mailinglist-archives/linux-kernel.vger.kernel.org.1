It's not a new concept, it's just completely idiotic. It didn't need to
be this crazy. There is absolutely no sane reason for it to be this
crazy.

The 4 counters in a single msr thing is insane because it uses a
division.

Very much worse, it explicitly uses the exact value of another counter
(SLOTS) to drive that division, creating a tight coupling between the
registers and completely and utterly destroying the SLOTS counter.

Since it keeps internal 'shadow' counters for the 4 events anyway, it
might as well have kept a shadow counter for the SLOTS event and driven
it off of that, that would have kept the SLOTS counter sane, but nooo,
gotta wreck that.

I also really don't buy that as a driver for all this insanity.
Optimizing MSRs to not be utterly stupid expensive would've been so much
saner and would've helped everyone.

This is just creating more wreckage.

What I really want to know is if future hardware is going to be as
stupid; or if there's going to be change. I really don't want to commit
to ABI here and then have to find out they fixed the hardware and we
can't do sane things anymore.

Obviously, future hardware is not something that is to be discussed, so
we're at a stand-still here.
