Linus, Peter:

the panic seen by Harald Arnesen (and Dave Kleikamp) is unrelated to
virtualization, and happens on all machines that have a CPU with less than 4
physical cores. It's a very serious (and very stupid) bug in the original
version of my code and is fixed by patch 2/4 "x86, sched: Account for CPUs
with less than 4 cores in freq. invariance" in the series 

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200416054745.740-1-ggherdovich@suse.cz

Harald, Dave:

for peace of mind, can you please share the output of

  turbostat --interval 1 sleep 0

from your machines? This should print a long list of power management-related
information, including your CPU model and the content of MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT.
In all likelihood that MSR says that the "4 cores turbo frequency" of your CPU
is zero, and the buggy code divides by that value.

Harald:

I'll echo Linus' request of testing that the patch series linked above fixes
the problem on your machine. Since you're testing -rc kernels and bisecting
bugs I assume you're comfortable with patching and compiling kernels, but if
that is not the case I am more than happy to assist by providing either an RPM
or a DEB package, depending on the distribution you're running. Let me know.

More comments below.

I think Peter is mentioning virtualization because in another patch of my
bugfix series I address a separate issue, indeed arising in hypervisors:
patch 1/4 "x86, sched: Bail out of frequency invariance if base frequency is
unknown".

The thing is that my original code does two divisions (just grep for "div" in
the patch 1567c3e3467c "x86, sched: Add support for frequency invariance").
One of them divides by zero when num_cpus < 4, the other divides by zero on
some hypervisors (basically).

Here are the incriminated statements (file arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c):

  (1)  arch_turbo_freq_ratio = div_u64(turbo_freq * SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE,
                                       base_freq);
       /* ... stuff ... */
       
       mcnt *= arch_max_freq_ratio;
  (2)  freq_scale = div64_u64(acnt, mcnt);

Hypervisors:
If base_freq is zero, division (1) fails. This is addressed by patch 1/4 in the
bugfix series linked above. base_freq is read from MSR_PLATFORM_INFO (no BIOS
involved, it's straight from the CPU) and is the max CPU clock frequency
without counting turbo. The Intel SDM specifies this MSR's content, none of the
machines I tested said "my base clock frequency is zero", but I didn't think
of hypervisors.

Small machines:
If turbo_freq is zero, division (2) fails. This is addressed by patch 2/4
"x86, sched: Account for CPUs with less than 4 cores in freq. invariance".
I read turbo_freq from MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT (again: no BIOS involved), at a
specific offset where it should contain the clock frequency sustainable by 4
cores simultaneously. If the machines has less than for cores, this data is
rightfully zero and thus the panic that Harald Arnesen and Dave Kleikamp
observed. It's an embarrassing mistake I made, I tested on several machines
including a consumer-level Atom Airmont (Dell Wyse thin client) but all had at
least 4 cores so I didn't see it.

For the records: there is a report for the "small machines" div-by-zero bug
from a 24 core Atom P-Series (new product line from 2020), but the fix works
on that machine, see
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/bf43772d-48e5-01d4-dd03-330110e487fa@linux.intel.com/

I'm going to send the following patch. There are a number of reasons why mcnt
overflowing and landing exactly at zero is unlikely (we read MPERF once every
tick, and arch_max_freq_ratio is a small number) but it's still a real problem
(eg. tickless kernels) and the zero check is 4 lines above where it should be,
it just needs to move down.
