Yes, I implemented the passthru_q (which was quite simple). But I'm not
sure how we are supposed to call nvme_command_effects() correctly
without the ns. You can't possibly do that during setup for every
possible opcode on every namespace. And even if we do, we'll still need
the same nvme_find_get_ns() and nvme_put_ns() exports and probably
another xarray to lookup the information.

Also, we pass the namespace's disk to in order to get proper block
accounting for the underlying disk. (Which is pretty important for
debugging). So we need to lookup the namespace for this too.

Unless there are some other ideas to solve these issues, I don't think
this change will gain us anything.
