I think we're in violent agreement, mostly.

Userspace can add the page without EXEC permissions in the EPCM, and thus
avoid the noexec/VM_MAYEXEC check.  The enclave can then do EMODPE to gain
EXEC permissions in the EPMC.  Without the ->mprotect() hook, we wouldn't
be able to detect/prevent such shenanigans.

As above, this does directly related to noexec/VM_MAYEXEC.

That's fine, I was responding to Andy's question, not intending to write a
changelog.

Yes, again, violent agreement :-).
