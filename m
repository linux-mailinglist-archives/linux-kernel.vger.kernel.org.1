Some high level thoughts:

Currently everything is done in workqueue context, it means all freeing
happens there. For RT kernel we can invoke a page allocator only for single
kfree_rcu() argument(though we skip it). As for double one, it is impossible,
that is why a simple path is used by linking rcu_head among each other for
further reclaim in wq context. As of now, for RT, everything is already
deferred.

If we revert to spinlock_t then calling of kfree_rcu() from hard IRQ
context is broken, even though we think that for RT kernel it will
never happen. Therefore i do not see a clear motivation and benefits
why we should revert to spinlock_t.

IMHO, if we can avoid of such drawback i would go with that way, i.e.
i would not like to think what to do with that when it becomes broken.

Thanks!
