The kernel interface cannot be changed. If packet sockets used to pass
the first byte up to userspace, they have to continue to do so.

So I think you can limit the header_ops to only dev_hard_header.

Fixes should be small and targeted. Any larger refactoring is
best addressed in a separate net-next patch.
