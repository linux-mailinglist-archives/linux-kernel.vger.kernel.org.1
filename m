So actually, on further reading, Vol 3 11.3 states "coherency is not
enforced by the processor’s bus coherency protocol" and later in 11.3.1,
"The WC buffer is not snooped and thus does not provide data coherency".


So, it would seem like it is possible to engineer a situation where the
cache line is WB according to the caches, and has pending WC data in one
or more cores/threads.  The question is whether this manifests as a
problem in practice, or not.

When changing the memory type of a mapping, you typically need to do
break/flush/make to be SMP-safe.  The IPI, as well as the TLB flush are
actions which cause WC buffers to be flushed.

x86 will tolerate a make/flush sequence as well.  In this scenario, a
3rd core/thread could pick up the line via its WB property, use it, and
cause it to be written back, between the pagetable change and the IPI
hitting.

But does this matter?  WC is by definition weakly ordered writes for
more efficient bus usage.  The device at the far end can't tell whether
the incoming write was from a WC or a WB eviction, and any late WC
evictions are semantically indistinguishable from a general concurrency
hazards with multiple writers.
