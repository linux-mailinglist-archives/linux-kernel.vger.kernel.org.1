Sorry, I missed your reply. I'm dropping fscrypt.rst changes
that were on this patch:

	[PATCH v6 23/80] docs: get rid of :c:type explicit declarations for structs

and replacing with the enclosed one that should be addressing
your issues.

Thanks,
Mauro

[PATCH v6.1 35/80] docs: fs: fscrypt.rst: get rid of :c:type: tags

The :c:type: tag has problems with Sphinx 3.x, as structs
there should be declared with c:struct.

So, remove them, relying at automarkup.py extension to
convert them into cross-references.
