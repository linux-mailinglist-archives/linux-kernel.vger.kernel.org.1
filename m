Hello Dear,

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know
that this letter may come to you as big surprise.  Actually, I came
across your E-mail from my personal search afterward I decided to
email you directly believing that you will be honest to fulfill my
final wish before i die. Meanwhile, I am Mrs.Romane Matheo, 62 years
old, from France, and I am  suffering from a long time cancer and from
all indication my condition is really deteriorating as my doctors have
confirmed and courageously Advised me that I may not live beyond two
months from now for the reason that my tumor has reached a  critical
stage which has defiled all forms of medical treatment, As a matter of
fact, registered nurse by profession while my  husband was dealing on
Gold Dust and Gold Dory Bars till his sudden death the year 2018 then
I took over his business till date. In fact, at this moment I have a
deposit sum of Seven million five hundred thousand US
dollars[$7,500,000.00] with one of the leading bank but unfortunately
I cannot visit the bank since I=E2=80=99m critically sick and powerless to =
do
anything myself but my bank account officer advised me to assign any
of my trustworthy relative, friends or partner with authorization
letter to stand as the recipient of my money but sorrowfully I don=E2=80=99=
t
have any reliable relative and no child.

Therefore, I want you to receive the money and take 50% to take care
of yourself and family while 50% should be use basically on
humanitarian purposes mostly to orphanages home, Motherless babies
home, less privileged and disable citizens and widows around the
world. And as soon as I receive your respond I shall send you the full
details with my pictures, banking records and with full contacts of my
banking institution to communicate them on the matter.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Yours Faithfully,
Mrs. Romane Matheo
