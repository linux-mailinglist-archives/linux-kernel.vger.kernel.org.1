Provide a little more information about the new G and L options,
particularly the issue with large PEBs.

 Note that last branch entries are cleared for each sample, so there is no overlap
 from one sample to the next.
 
+The G and L options are designed in particular for sample mode, and work much
+like g and l but add call chain and branch stack to the other selected events
+instead of synthesized events. For example, to record branch-misses events for
+'ls' and then add a call chain derived from the Intel PT trace:
+
+	perf record --aux-sample -e '{intel_pt//u,branch-misses:u}' -- ls
+	perf report --itrace=Ge
+
+Although in fact G is a default for perf report, so that is the same as just:
+
+	perf report
+
+One caveat with the G and L options is that they work poorly with "Large PEBS".
+Large PEBS means PEBS records will be accumulated by hardware and the written
+into the event buffer in one go.  That reduces interrupts, but can give very
+late timestamps.  Because the Intel PT trace is synchronized by timestamps,
+the PEBS events do not match the trace.  Currently, Large PEBS is used only in
+certain circumstances:
+	- hardware supports it
+	- PEBS is used
+	- event period is specified, instead of frequency
+	- the sample type is limited to the following flags:
+		PERF_SAMPLE_IP | PERF_SAMPLE_TID | PERF_SAMPLE_ADDR |
+		PERF_SAMPLE_ID | PERF_SAMPLE_CPU | PERF_SAMPLE_STREAM_ID |
+		PERF_SAMPLE_DATA_SRC | PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER |
+		PERF_SAMPLE_TRANSACTION | PERF_SAMPLE_PHYS_ADDR |
+		PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR | PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER |
+		PERF_SAMPLE_PERIOD (and sometimes) | PERF_SAMPLE_TIME
+Because Intel PT sample mode uses a different sample type to the list above,
+Large PEBS is not used with Intel PT sample mode. To avoid Large PEBS in other
+cases, avoid specifying the event period i.e. avoid the 'perf record' -c option,
+--count option, or 'period' config term.
+
 To disable trace decoding entirely, use the option --no-itrace.
