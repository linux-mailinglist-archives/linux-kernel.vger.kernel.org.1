There is an on-going trend to make unprivileged containers typical
containers.

I forget the details but systemd has a feature where it will randomly
allocate a uid for a service.  Calling them something like temporariy uids.

Which is /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid, and it was very much inspired from
the same source.

Very much so.  There are containers who otherwise would use the same uid
range. (AKA they have the same set of users).  But can't because there
are cases like daemons that set their RLIMIT_NPROC to 1.  Because the
daemon knows that user for that daemon will never run any other
processes.

Run two containers with the same mappings and that daemon DOS's itself.

Just have a limited number of mappings for the cases that actually need
on-disk storage.  The key idea is adding uids that don't need to be
mapped.  Everything else stays the same.

Not a new thing.  Just the user that created the user namespace.
It is suggested to refine the idea so that users that don't map
anywhere show up as the creator of the user namespace.

I think there were more concerns raised that I think actually exist.
The owner/creator of a user namespace can already manage an container
and send it signals.  That is built into the capability system call.
Nothing needs to change there.

The only real question I see is which uids and gids do we show to
processes that are outside of the user namespace, when the uids and gids
don't map.

The consensus was to start with what is working now.

Users that don't map outside of the user namespace will show up and work
properly in on tmpfs.  Or a fuse implementation of ext4 on top of a
file.

Interesting until reading through your commentary I had missed the
proposal to effectively effectively change the permissions to:
((mode >> 3) & (mode >> 6) & mode & 7).

The challenge is that in a permission triple it is possible to set
lower permissions for the owner of the file, or for a specific group,
than for everyone else.

Today we require root permissions to be able to map users and groups in
/proc/<pid>/uid_map and /proc/<pid>/gid_map, and we require root
permissions to be able to drop groups with setgroups.

Now we are discussiong moving to a world where we can use users and
groups that don't map to any other user namespace in uid_map and
gid_map.  It should be completely safe to use those users and groups
except for negative permissions in filesystems.  So a big question is
how do we arrange the system so anyone can use those files without
negative permission causing problems.


I believe it is safe to not limit the owner of a file, as the
owner of a file can always chmode the file and remove any restrictions.
Which is no worse than calling setuid to a different uid.

Which leaves where we have been dealing with the ability to drop groups
with setgroups.

I guess the practical proposal is when the !in_group_p and we are
looking at the other permission.  Treat the permissions as:
((mode >> 3) & mode & 7).  Instead of just (mode & 7).

Which for systems who don't use negative group permissions is a no-op.
So this should not effect your btrfs snapshots at all (unless you use
negative group permissions).

It denies things before we get to an NFS server or other interesting
case so it should work for pretty much everything the kernel deals with.

Userspace repeating permission checks could break.  But that is just a
problem of inconsistency, and will always be a problem.

We could make it more precise as Serge was suggesting with a set of that
were dropped from setgroups, but under the assumption that negative
groups are sufficient rare we can avoid that overhead.

 static int acl_permission_check(struct inode *inode, int mask)
 {
 	unsigned int mode = inode->i_mode;
 
- [irrelevant bits of this function]        
 
 	/* Only RWX matters for group/other mode bits */
 	mask &= 7;
 
 	/*
 	 * Are the group permissions different from
 	 * the other permissions in the bits we care
 	 * about? Need to check group ownership if so.
 	 */
 	if (mask & (mode ^ (mode >> 3))) {
 		if (in_group_p(inode->i_gid))
 			mode >>= 3;
+		/* Use the most restrictive permissions? */
+		else (current->user_ns->flags & USERNS_ALWAYS_DENY_GROUPS)
+			mode &= (mode >> 3);
 	}
 
 	/* Bits in 'mode' clear that we require? */
 	return (mask & ~mode) ? -EACCES : 0;
 }

As I read posix_acl_permission all of the posix acls for groups are
positive permissions.  So I think the only other code that would need to
be updated would be the filesystems that replace generic_permission with
something that doesn't call acl_permission check.

Userspace could then activate this mode with:
	echo "safely_allow" > /proc/<pid>/setgroups

That looks very elegant and simple, and I don't think will cause
problems for anyone.  It might even make sense to make that the default
mode when creating a new user namespace.

I guess we owe this idea to Josh Triplett and Geoffrey Thomas.

Does anyone see any problems with tweaking the permissions this way so
that we can always allow setgroups in a user namespace?

Eric
