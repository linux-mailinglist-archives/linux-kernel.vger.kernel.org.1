This is the best I could dig up. The site is slow as molasses. I don't
want to focus or critique any specific vendor's downstream code
though. Providing these links just to prove that this is a real issue.

Search for "proxy" here. You'll notice how that will also need changes
to regulator header files, etc. The 4.9 kernel is the latest publicly
available version AFAIK.
https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/la/kernel/msm-4.9/plain/drivers/regulator/core.c?h=msm-4.9

As for the specific example of those devices, I'm not sure how much of
that stuff is publicly available and I don't want to deal with finding
that out.

By default regulator_cleanup_timeout is set to 30s. So by default,
it's not going to be "possibly quite a long time". So, at worst, for
the first 30 seconds voltages can't be lowered below boot level and
regulators can't be turned off if they were left on by the boot
loader. If a consumer is not an exclusive consumer, then none of this
should break functional correctness for them and just be 30 seconds of
suboptimal power. And exclusive consumers won't have this issue.

I think the default behavior should be for functional correctness
(example in the commit text) and then go for optimization (being able
to power off regulators before 30s into boot). Even with the timeout
set, this series makes it much easier for driver developers to ensure
functional correctness instead of playing initcall chicken between the
supplier and the N consumers.

Actually on systems without all the drivers, I'd argue the correct
behavior is this patch series + regulator_cleanup_timeout=-1. This
patch series will prevent system instability/unusability (Eg: missing
display backlight driver) at the cost of power optimization. However,
to allow turning off boot on regulators in systems without all the
drivers where it happens to not cause functional correctness issues,
we have the timeout default to 30s.

I agree, hacking around any issues using _get_exclusive() when they
don't really need exclusive access is not a solution.

Treating this as a "LATER_initcall()" has several issues.
1. initcall levels set a max limit on the depth of device dependency.
Since DT devices are added at arch initcall level, that gives us about
5 levels if you ignore the _sync ones. Adding more isn't going to
scale or solve the problem because in reality, the dependencies are
much deeper.
2. Also, initcall call ordering also depends on Makefile/link
ordering. Which is fragile and error prone.
3. I know Greg hates playing initcall chicken.
4. "initcall levels" don't work for modules. The kernel initcall
levels are done by the time modules are loaded.
5. "initcall levels" don't work with deferred probing.
6. If the answer is, "have userspace tell us when all modules are
loaded" -- then we are depending on userspace for functional
correctness AND for turning off regulators. Which IMHO is worse than
this patch series.
7. If we somehow manage to add a "LATER_initcall" that doesn't have
the issues above, it has to work for all frameworks. So, it has to
come after ALL the devices in the system have probed. Not just "all
devices of a supplier". So, again, it's worse than this patch series,
at least for systems where all the drivers are present.

If they really NEED to turn power off to get to a known good state,
then they really need to be exclusive consumers.

I'm not sure I fully understand what you'd need to tune in the
bootloader. But independent of that, by default we still have the 30s
timeout, so there's no boot loader tuning necessary. Just a 30s delay
before being able to "optimize power" during development flow.

I think this patch series actually helps a lot during the development
phase (especially with regulator_cleanup_timeout=-1):
1. It will allow adding/enabling new drivers without worrying about
the system crashing due to the example scenario mentioned in the
commit text.
2. In my development flow, I had to do some stuff manually and then
load some modules. Without this series, when some of the regulator
drivers were built in, the regulators would get turned off after the
30s timeout before I could do my manual stuff. That would kill the
system. Or if I start off the boot and walk away to get coffee, I'd
come back to a dead device. It was super annoying to deal with this.
3. When the regulator drivers are loaded as modules (after 30s
timeout), some of the boot on regulators are never turned off until
one of their consumers starts making requests. For example, if a
regulator that supplies some camera component is left on by the
bootloader, it would never get turned off unless you open the camera
app. With this series, the regulator would get turned off after the
camera driver probes.

To be clear, I understand the cases you are mentioning and I'm not
discounting them. But compared to the 30 seconds of additional "on
time", the functional correctness issues are more important. I'm not
saying this series is the perfect solution, but it's certainly better
than what we have now and we have the default behavior to be as least
disruptive as possible to systems that work fine without this series.
And if I find incremental improvements in the future, I'll send
patches for that. But I'd hate to see perfect be the enemy of the
good.

Makes sense. I'll fix this.
