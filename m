I guess I'm a bit new to stable backports so I'm not sure what's expected here.
The failing patch fixes a bug by using a new interface.  The smallest diff fix
for the stable kernels would be to construct a similar fix without the new
interface, which in this case is very easy as the new interface just converted
some generic locking calls to one-line functions.  It seems somewhat circuitous
to land that in Linus' tree, though, as it would require breaking our port
before fixing it to use the old interfaces and then cleaning it up to use the
new interfaces.

Are we expected to pull the new interface onto stable in addition to this fix?
The new interface doesn't actually fix anything itself, but it would allow a
functional kernel to be constructed that consisted of only backports from
Linus' tree (which would also make further fixes easier).  It seems safe to
just pull in 9740ca4e95b4 ("mmap locking API: initial implementation as rwsem
wrappers") before this failing patch, as in this case the new interface will
function correctly with only a subset of callers having been converted.  Of
course that's not a generally true statement so I don't know if future code
will behave that way, but pulling in those conversion patches is definitely
unnecessary diff right now.

That certainly seems like the right way to go for now, thanks!
