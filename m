Huh, no!  It's all done for you today automagically by userspace:

$ tree /dev/disk/by-label/
/dev/disk/by-label/
├── boot -> ../../sda1
├── fast_disk -> ../../md0
├── root -> ../../sda2
└── stuff -> ../../dm-0

Look on your laptop/desktop/server today for those, there's lots of
symlinks in /dev/disk/

Userspace knows how to read labels on a per-filesystem-basis and does so
just fine.  That's how it creates those symlinks, no kernel support is
needed.

This has been implemented for 15+ years now, it's not a new thing...

Now if your embedded system doesn't support it, that's the userspace of
that system's fault, it's not the kernel's fault at all.  Go fix your
userspace if you want those things.
