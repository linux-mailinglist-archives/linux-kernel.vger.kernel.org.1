It's complicated ;-)

So this sync is basically a relative reset of S to 0.

So with 2 queues, when one goes idle, we drop them both to 0 and one
then increases due to not being idle, and the idle one builds up lag to
get re-elected. So far so simple, right?

When there's 3, we can have the situation where 2 run and one is idle,
we sync to 0 and let the idle one build up lag to get re-election. Now
suppose another one also drops idle. At this point dropping all to 0
again would destroy the built-up lag from the queue that was already
idle, not good.

So instead of syncing everything, we can:

  less := !((s64)(s_a - s_b) <= 0)

  (v_a - S_a) - (v_b - S_b) == v_a - v_b - S_a + S_b
                            == v_a - (v_b - S_a + S_b)

IOW, we can recast the (lag) comparison to a one-sided difference.
So if then, instead of syncing the whole queue, sync the idle queue
against the active queue with S_a + S_b at the point where we sync.

(XXX consider the implication of living in a cyclic group: N / 2^n N)

This gives us means of syncing single queues against the active queue,
and for already idle queues to preseve their build-up lag.

Of course, then we get the situation where there's 2 active and one
going idle, who do we pick to sync against? Theory would have us sync
against the combined S, but as we've already demonstated, there is no
such thing in infeasible weight scenarios.

One thing I've considered; and this is where that core_active rudiment
came from, is having active queues sync up between themselves after
every tick. This limits the observed divergence due to the work
conservance.

On top of that, we can improve upon things by moving away from our
horrible (10) hack and moving to (9) and employing (13) here.

Anyway, I got partway through that in the past days, but then my head
hurt. I'll consider it some more :-)

But this loop is after selection has been done; we don't modify
new_active during selection.

Correct; that's rudiments from an SMT-n attempt.

At the very least it should be min_vruntime when cfs_rq_a == cfs_rq_b,
ie. when we're on the same CPU.

For the other case I was considering that tick based active sync, but
never got that finished and admittedly it all looks a bit weird. But I
figured I'd send it out so we can at least advance the discussion.
