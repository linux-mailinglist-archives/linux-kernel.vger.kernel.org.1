Hi André,

Sorry for the delay, I missed the thread on this issue.

The failure is a "crit" kernel error message.  The test job still
completes, but it has detected this new error and the bisection
reliably lands on the same commit mentioned below as the root
cause.  As you found out, the commit is not to blame so this is a
false positive.  However, it's a bit more complicated...

All the test jobs involved in this bisection can be found here:

  https://lava.ciplatform.org/scheduler/alljobs?length=25&search=lava-bisection-2224#table

The bisection first ran the "good" and "bad" revisions and didn't
detect the kernel error message with the "good" one.  However,
taking a closer look at the logs, the error was actually there:

  https://lava.ciplatform.org/scheduler/job/27647#L454

and then there were some kernel warnings:

  https://lava.ciplatform.org/scheduler/job/27647#L561

which didn't occur with the "bad" revision:

  https://lava.ciplatform.org/scheduler/job/27648


For some reason probably related to the kernel warnings, when
testing the "good" revision the GIC kernel errors got silenced
and dmesg didn't print them.  This mislead the test into a false
positive.

Bisections are only run when a regression occurs, and it looks
like these GIC errors have been around for a long time.  What I
believe happened is that the errors got hidden at some
point (allegedly due to the kernel warnings) and then came back
later.  This was then wrongly detected as a regression.


So we have 2 problems to solve, the first one is to actually
remove these kernel errors and you've explained how to do that
with the QEMU command line.  I've resubmitted the test job with
it and it worked indeed:

  https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/2493885

and sent a fix for it:

  https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/pull/442


The other problem is about avoiding such cases from occurring
again in the future on kernelci.org, by making kernel error
detection more robust.  But that's not a kernel problem.

Please bear with us, hopefully this false positive should not
come back.  Thanks for your help with investigating the GIC
errors in the first place.

Guillaume
