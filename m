The current permission checks on /proc/<pid>/map_files/ are simply
someone being over-cautious.

Someone needs to think through the threat landscape and figure out what
permission checks are actually needed.

Making the permission check ns_capable instead of capable is a
no-brainer.  Figuring out which user_ns to test against might be a
we bit harder.

We could probably even allow the owner of the process to open the files
but that requires someone doing the work of thinking through how
being able to opening files that you have mmaped might be a problem.

Please if one is for checkpoint and one is for restore asking for a pair
of capabilities is probably more appropriate.

If we are only talking 2 things can you please include in your patchset
a patch enabling those 2 things?

But even more than this we need a request that asks not for the least
you can possibly ask for but asks for what you need to do a good job.

I am having visions of a recurring discussion that says can we add one
more permission check to CAP_RESTORE or CAP_CHECKPOINT when they are
things we could know today.
