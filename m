Derived this from an earlier discussion (https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/10/17/231)
but current representation here might not be accurate.

Would this be any better ?

pmd_present(pmd):

- Returns true if pmd refers to system RAM with a valid pmd_page(pmd)
- Returns false if pmd refers to a migration or swap entry
