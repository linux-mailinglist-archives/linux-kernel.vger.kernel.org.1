Yeah. To answer Michal's "it could be reused for something else" - yes, somebody
could allocate it from the pcplist before we do the extra drain. But then it
becomes "visible again" and the loop in __offline_pages() should catch it by
scan_movable_pages() - do_migrate_range(). And this time the pageblock is
already marked as isolated, so the page (freed by migration) won't end up on the
pcplist again.
