It is talking about the new PTE bit being used here not any
helper. Though the following replacement might be better.

s/This help indicate/This bit indicates/

/*
 * This help indicate that the entry is present i.e pmd_page()
 * still points to a valid huge page in memory even if the pmd
 * has been invalidated.
 */
#define PMD_PRESENT_INVALID	(_AT(pteval_t, 1) << 59) /* only when !PMD_SECT_VALID */
