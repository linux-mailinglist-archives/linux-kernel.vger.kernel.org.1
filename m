The store of state_in_sysfs is already done in kobject_add_internal(). 
It's an existing flag people already use to tell if the kobject has
been exposed in sysfs.  However, it's set after the sysfs directory
creation succeeds.  This is the code with some debugging removed:

	error = create_dir(kobj);
	if (error) {
		kobj_kset_leave(kobj);
		kobject_put(parent);
		kobj->parent = NULL;
		...
	} else
		kobj->state_in_sysfs = 1;

	return error;

So it's the very last thing set before kobject_add_internal() returns
success ... which is pretty much the last thing kobject_init_and_add()
does.

> It feels more robust to stick with the put though..

possibly ... like I said, the only concern with the put path is that
->release has state expectations that aren't met if
kobject_init_and_add fails.  I think none of the callers that currently
does kfree() on error has a problem with this, but it should be
checked.

However, adding unwinding correctly keeps either kfree or put correct
in the event of kobject_init_and_add() failure.
