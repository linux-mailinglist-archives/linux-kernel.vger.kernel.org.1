It's not just userspace. Some drivers call irq_set_affinity{_hint}}() 
also, with a non-overlapping affinity mask.

We could just error these requests, but some drivers rely on this 
behavior. Consider the uncore driver I mentioned above, which WARNs when 
the affinity setting fails. So it tries to set the affinity with the 
cpumask of the cluster associated with the device, but with D06's ITS 
config, below, there may be no overlap.

Right

A bit more complicated: 2 sockets, 2 NUMA nodes per socket, and ITS 
config as follows:
D06ES  1x ITS with proximity node #0

root@(none)$ dmesg | grep ITS
[ 0.000000] SRAT: PXM 0 -> ITS 0 -> Node 0


D06CS
2x ITS with proximity node #0, #2

estuary:/$ dmesg | grep ITS
[    0.000000] SRAT: PXM 0 -> ITS 0 -> Node 0
[    0.000000] SRAT: PXM 2 -> ITS 1 -> Node 2

It complicates things.

We could add extra intelligence to record if an node has an ITS 
associated. In the case of that not being true, we would fallback on the 
requested affin only (for case of no overlap). It gets a bit more messy 
then.

Thanks,
John
