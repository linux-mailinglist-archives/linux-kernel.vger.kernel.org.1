I do not follow. If you are hotremoving during shutdown then how come
the value of min_free_kbytes matter at all?

Do you have the full oom splat? The fact that previous oom killer
invocations haven't helped and all the eligible tasks have been killed
and you still hit the oom would suggest there is a lot of memory
allocated without a direct relation to tasks. I fail to see how
min_free_kbytes would be related.

The auto tuned value should never reach such a low value to cause
problems.
