Hi Mark 

thanks for the review.

Yes indeed 'widely' was a bit of an exaggeration, what I (poorly) meant to point
out was that beside still used is deprecated and so not a viable option to solve
my issue.

The 'issue' I observed while working on another series was that with the
following example DT:

firmware {
	scmi {
		...
		scmi_voltage: scmi_protocol@17 {
			reg = <0x17>;
			
			regulators {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				regulator_scmi_discrete: regulator_scmi_discrete@0 {
					reg = <0>;
				};
				
				regulator_scmi_range: regulator_scmi_range@2 {
					reg = <2>;
				};
				
				regulator_scmi_vd3: regulator_scmi@3 {
					reg = <3>;
				};

				regulator_scmi_vd4: regulator_scmi@4 {
					reg = <4>;
				};
			};
		};
};

and the struct regulator_desc configured roughly as:

	sreg->desc.regulators_node = "regulators";
	sreg->desc.of_match = sreg->of_node->name;    <<< This being the regulator_* nodes

the regulator framework standard initialization routines were able to match univocally the
first two regulators above (and parse autonomously the constraints without me explicitly
calling of_get_regulator_init_data() as in a previous version of the series), but got fooled
by the last two since the node name is the same and they differ only by the index, which in
turn anyway seemed to me a sensible thing to be able to do when a node uses reg indexing.

Note that with these SCMI regulators this .of_match configuration happens dynamically at
run-time (as above) since it is defined by the DT and the SCMI fw platform which regulators are
visible and defined and the common SCMI regulator driver handles them all if defined in the DT
and known to the SCMI fw, while with the normal regulators the .of_match setup happens statically
at compile time with macros driver by driver, since the DT defines what is present and the driver
declares what can support.

With this patch you could support both the above naming instead configuring like:

	sreg->desc.regulators_node = "regulators";
	sreg->desc.of_match_full_name = true;
	sreg->desc.of_match = sreg->of_node->full_name;

but I'm not sure that this is needed and worth the effort sincerely at this point,
and probably makes more sense to look at this possible naming issue after I post
the whole original series (without this patch) just to be sure I'm not getting
something wrong somewhere else instead.

Yes I agree it is hard to understand how to use this from the commit log and if
it is useful or not in a specific use case.

It's an option but it would have doubled the following strncmp() if we just started
checking against full_name every time we fail to find against name so I thought
to make it configurable with the new of_match_full_name....but, given it is far from
clear with this proposed patch, maybe it's better to use a default fallback as you said.

At this point I could just hold this patch and post the original series ignoring
the above issue at first and discuss around that code if this is needed at all
(so to have more context to discuss this), or simplify the patch as above if you
think this fix is still worth.
