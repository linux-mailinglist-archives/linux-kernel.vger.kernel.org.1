Upstream GRUB does not implement the EFI handover protocol at all, and
the distros all have their own GRUB forks that implement this along
with mixed mode, secure boot, shim, measured boot etc.

What you are saying is that GRUB forks turn out to exist that violate
both the PE/COFF specification and the Linux/x86 boot protocol in a
way that might break mixed mode, and nobody noticed until you happened
to find it by code inspection. While I appreciate the effort, I think
this is where I would like to draw the line, and say that there is
only so much we can do to work around bugs in out-of-tree forks of
other projects. So unless it can be done cleanly and without losing
any of the benefits of the recent cleanup and optimization work, I'd
say don't bother.
