Interesting mitigation and discussion!

Regarding the impact on the AnC attack, indeed fine-grained (or full)
mmap() randomization affects AnC in two ways: (i) it breaks the
contiguity of the mmap() region, crippling the sliding primitive AnC
relies on; (ii) it ensures an attacker leaking an address in a
particular VMA can't easily infer addresses in other VMAs. So, in
short, the mitigation does raise the bar against AnC-like attacks and
I see this as a useful addition.

Indeed, we're aware some vendors implemented a similar randomization
strategy in the browser as a mitigation against AnC.

Nonetheless, some additional notes on the two points I raised above:

- (i) [Sliding] Note that an attacker can do away with sliding
depending on the randomization entropy and other available side
channels. For instance, with the recent TagBleed, we show how to
combine a TLB side channel with AnC to exhaust the KASLR entropy.
However, similar attacks should be possible in userland, again
depending on the randomization entropy used. See
https://download.vusec.net/papers/tagbleed_eurosp20.pdf. Combining
side channels with transient/speculative execution attacks can further
lower the bar.

- (ii) [Leaks] Depending on the software vulnerability used for
exploitation, it might not be difficult for an attacker to break
fine-grained randomization across VMAs. That is, leak an address from
VMA 1, use the vulnerability to trigger a normally illegal access to
VMA 2, leak an address from VMA 2, repeat. Of course, the exploit
might take much longer depending on how far on the pointer chasing
chain the target is.

Best,
Cristiano
