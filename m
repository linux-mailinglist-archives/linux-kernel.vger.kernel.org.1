There's already a /sys/devices/.../<device>/waiting_for_supplier file
that tells you if the device is waiting for a supplier device to be
added. That file goes away once the device probes. If the file has 1,
then it's waiting for the supplier device to be added (like your
case). If it's 0, then the device is just waiting on one of the
existing suppliers to probe. You can find the existing suppliers
through /sys/devices/.../<device>/supplier:*/supplier. Also, flip
these dev_dbg() to dev_info() if you need more details about deferred
probing.
