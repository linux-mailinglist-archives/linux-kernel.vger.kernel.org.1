Hey Stephen,
Thanks for taking time to review the patch.

What I meant to say was qcom implementation of TZ or qcom
proprietary bootloaders. I should have been more specific
and mentioned that the configuration is done at EL2 by QHEE
(Qualcomm's Hypervisor Execution Environment) before we enter
the kernel.

I decided to include Sai's S-b just to show I took back
ownership of the patch from his patch series. I'll drop
it in the next re-spin.

Thanks for taking time to reword the commit message will use
the same with a few corrections.

I'll use ^^ as is.

Typically this direct mapping is configured statically at EL2
by QHEE (Qualcomm's Hypervisor Execution Environment) before
the kernel is entered.

In certain firmware configuration, especially when the kernel is already 
in full control of the SMMU, defer programming the modem SIDs to the
kernel. Let's add compatibles here so that we can have the kernel
program the SIDs for the modem in these cases.

Will/Stephen,
Let me know if the above changes are okay? I'll re-spin the patch
based on your feedback.
