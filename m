Either 2 or 3 would be simpler (re-tag the memory location or the
pointer) with the caveats I mentioned. Also, does the slab allocator
need to touch the memory on free with a tagged pointer? Otherwise slab
may hit an MTE fault itself.

If you want to restrict this to the KASAN tests, just add some
MTE-specific accessors with a fixup entry similar to get_user/put_user.
__do_kernel_fault() (if actually called) will invoke the fixup code
which skips the access and returns an error. This way KASAN tests can
actually verify that tag checking works, I'd find this a lot more
useful.
