	Hi guys,
do you think playing with words will really get you anywhere
or help anyone?

> +On the triviality of replacing words

You're not going to make white black, make a native African
white, or fix age-old crimes by this "triviality".

You're only going to sort of please those who actually
hate you -- and everyone creative -- because they envy.
Or rather subdue to their twisted will (what's next on
the list, cannibalism aproval extorted from you?).


Have you seen this post by a teacher?
https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/gulna2/i_used_to_teach_in_a_black_inner_city_school/

Do you believe that a typical late-USSRish quota system
for those who do not want to learn will help them learn?

I'd rather start with helping those who DO want to learn
by protecting them from their disruptive environment that
pulls them back into morass.


That whole "inclusivity" agenda is extremely toxic and
hypocritical -- this king is so naked that it takes a late
Soviet-style propaganda and party-bashing to make people
shut up and not even confess that a black criminal's life
might only be an excuse and not the reason to murder and
pillage zounds of other people of any skin color -- with
only some black people daring to point out that the said
criminal was once threating a pregnant black woman with
his gun aimed at her baby not yet even born, for example.

That orwellish "inclusivity" that excludes on intent,
ill-meaning "goodwill", silencing "free speech" is what
seems to be going to bury the country where many of you
work and live.

I wouldn't say I wish USA good health and good luck --
it is the country that ruined USSR on intent and that
ruined former Ukraine on intent (I used to live in Kiev
since early 1980s up till 2014 when USA-made nazi coup
destroyed the country).  But I should at least warn you
that you're playing with demon core, not even with fire;
you're rushing to support moral rapists when you could
at least stay where you are.


I write that as a person made in USSR back in 1979,
just in case.  It was still Russia, but I remember
those kitchen talks that are no more needed.  And I
remember a "why do you learn?" question back in 1993.

You can argue and call me an intolerant liar, welcome.
Time will tell and you have no power over it, comrades.


PS: those who find this kind of abuse unacceptable
are welcome to Russia if they fail to protect their
homeland -- we've learned it all too well already,
so we *do* value our freedom -- and stand by it.
Look for Innopolis.

PPS: James, kudos to you!  Prepare for your share
of "democratic shelling" though.  Hope you stand.
