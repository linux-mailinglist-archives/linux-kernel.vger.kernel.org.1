I think we should require one of:

- starting plan line
- ending plan line
- ending with something that indicates "I'm done, but I have no idea how
  many tests actually ran" (Maybe "1..?")

To me, the point of the plan line is to be able to say "this test did,
in fact, finish". So even if some test can't even count how many tests
it _ran_, it can at least say "I am now finished".

I find the dash to be distracting -- it doesn't help me scan it, and it
doesn't help a parser (which only needs to find "#").

I sent a bunch of clean-ups for kselftest.h recently[1], but it looks
like we'll need more for adding "description" to skip (right now it only
prints the SKIP reason).

Sounds good!
