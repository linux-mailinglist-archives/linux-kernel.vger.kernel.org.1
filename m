But that would require a bunch of tasks agreeing on which TID to tag with.
For example, if 2 tasks tag with each other's TID, then they would have
different tags and not share.

What's wrong with passing in an integer instead? In any case, we would do the
CAP_SYS_ADMIN check to limit who can do it.

Also, one thing CGroup interface allows is an external process to set the
cookie, so I am wondering if we should use sched_setattr(2) instead of, or in
addition to, the prctl(2). That way, we can drop the CGroup interface
completely. How do you feel about that?

Yes, ok. I can reword the commit log a bit to make it more clear that we are
specifying who we can share a core with.

Fair enough :-)

If we drop the CGroup interface, this would avoid both #1 and #2.
