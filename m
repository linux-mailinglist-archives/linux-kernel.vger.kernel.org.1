The "unlikely" approach has the benefit of keeping all corner cases in
place. I was tempted to say it could still make sense to get rid of the
extra check entirely, given that it has an impact only when:

- sum_nr_running == group_weight
- group capacity has been noticeably reduced

If sum_nr_running < group_weight, we won't evaluate it.
If sum_nr_running > group_weight, we either won't call into
  group_has_capacity() or we'll have checked it already in
  group_overloaded().

That said, it does make very much sense to check it in that ==
case. Vincent might have a different take on this, but right now I'd say
the unlikely approach is the safest one of the two.
