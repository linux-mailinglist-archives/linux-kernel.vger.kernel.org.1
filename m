If my proposed changes are made, then there are at least 3 ways to detect
a broken FDT or prevent the problem caused by the broken FDT.


1) Use the validation process that uses the bindings to validate the
devicetree source.


2) Modify patch 1/3.  The small part of the patch to modify is:

+static int mfd_match_of_node_to_dev(struct platform_device *pdev,
+				    struct device_node *np,
+				    const struct mfd_cell *cell)
+{
+	struct mfd_of_node_entry *of_entry;
+	const __be32 *reg;
+	u64 of_node_addr;
+
+	/* Skip devices 'disabled' by Device Tree */
+	if (!of_device_is_available(np))
+		return -ENODEV;
+
+	/* Skip if OF node has previously been allocated to a device */
+	list_for_each_entry(of_entry, &mfd_of_node_list, list)

Change:

+		if (of_entry->np == np)
+			return -EAGAIN;

To:

+		if (of_entry->np == np) {
+			if (!cell->use_of_reg)
+				return -EINVAL;
+			else
+				return -EAGAIN;

There may be a better choice than EINVAL, but I am just showing the method.

You may also want to refactor this section of the patch slightly
differently to achieve the same result.  It was just easiest to
show the suggested change the way I did it.

The test that returns EINVAL detects the issue that the FDT does
not match the binding (there is more one child node with the
"stericsson,ab8500-pwm" compatible.


3) I'm not sure if the pre-parsing that is wanted is parsing of the
devicetree or parsing of the struct mfd_cell array.  If the mfd_cell
array then solution 3 is not acceptable.

A different change to a small part of patch 1/3.  In mfd_add_devices(),
validate parameter "cells".  The validation could precede the existing
code, or it could be folded into the existing for loop.  The validation
is checking for any other element of the cells array containing
the same compatible value if cell->use_of_reg is not true for an element.

If this validation occurs, then I think mfd_of_node_list, and all the
associated code to deal with it is no longer needed.  But I didn't
look at this part in detail, so maybe I missed something.

The validation is something like (untested):

	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_OF)
		for (i = 0; i < n_devs; i++) {
			this_cell = cells + i;
			if (!this_cell->use_of_reg) {
				for (j = 1; j < n_devs; j++) {
					if (j != i) {
						cell = cells + j;
						if (!strcmp(this_cell->of_compatible, cell->of_compatible))
							return -EINVAL;
					}
				}
			}
		}
