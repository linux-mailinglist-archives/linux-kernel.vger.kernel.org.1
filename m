Agree with your concerns.
But could we consider that an application using this char dev, is no more
compatible with existing interface? 
And it would make sense that it requests exclusivity on
the remote firmware lice cycle. In this case the sysfs state should be
read only to protect from an unexpected shutdown.

Yes, that why it could be nice to make it scalable to integrate
future extension that can not be implemented using sysfs.

One of my main concern is that forcing the boot on open and shutdown on
close limits the usage of this device for some other future purposes. 
Coming back in the future to a generic solution will be not possible
as case of impact on the open close behaviour.
Using ioctls would avoid this limitation...
Ioctl could be used to enable the boot/shutdown on open/close

Then this char device could be also used to generate an event for application
on crash.
In this case the char device could be used only for the event, and sysfs
state would be used to manage the remoteproc firmware. So sysfs state should
be in read write access...

Concerning the firmware name, today sysfs interface imposes only one firmware
what's happen if more that one firmware loading is requested (for instance 
a core firmware with of some processing or rpc modules...).
In this case the sysfs firmware field could not be used.

These examples make me think that sysfs could be to manage through
remoteproc_cdev instead of directly calling core function.
This would help to define dynamic rules for the sysfs access. 

To sum up, nothing against opening interface with the char device.
I'm just wondering if this device should not be designed to allow some future
extensions of the API, and not only for this use case.
