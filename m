Same, I haven't been able to keep up with the versions or the recent review
feedback.  I got through about half of v17 last week and hope to have more time
for the rest this week and beyond.

Alex, do you have a pointer to the modified readtwice case?

Even better would be a description of the problem you're having in production
with lru_lock.  We might be able to create at least a simulation of it to show
what the expected improvement of your real workload is.

I ran a few benchmarks on v17 last week (sysbench oltp readonly, kerndevel from
mmtests, a memcg-ized version of the readtwice case I cooked up) and then today
discovered there's a chance I wasn't running the right kernels, so I'm redoing
them on v18.  Plan to look into what other, more "macro" tests would be
sensitive to these changes.
