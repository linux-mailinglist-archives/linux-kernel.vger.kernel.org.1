The result is the same for both | and || as they are both higher
priority than ?: (which is only higher priority than ,).

The () around the == aren't needed (except to stop the compiler
bleating). The bitwise | is lower priority than == because it
existed before || and K&R didn't change the priority when they
added || (I think they've said later they wished they had.)

The () around the entire ?: clause are needed.

So the code is the same as:
	rval = PD_CTL_HOST_READY;
	if (alg_type == CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_AHASH | alg_type == CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_AEAD)
		rval |= PD_CTL_HASH_FINAL;
	return rval;

Using | may well generate faster code (no branches).
