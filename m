I hadn't followed all the previous discussions, but generally if two
people are independently confused by the same thing it's a sign that
it needs to be explained better.  In this case that means a better
commit message that explains exactly why this isn't a problem.

OK, I think I understand what you're trying to say.  What you're
saying is that the important thing is that when you're using the
kernel's "lazy" mode that the kernel will have knowledge of whether a
disabled IRQ is pending.  That's because the IRQ fired once (and the
kernel set IRQS_PENDING) before it got masked.  If we're using a
non-lazy case then the IRQ could be pending but the kernel wouldn't
know.

If that's what you're relying on for this patch to work then it
belongs in the commit message.

...but (see below) I don't think it's working like you think it does.

...but what if it's an edge interrupt?  Then:

1. It will fire.
2. It will get marked as IRQS_PENDING and Acked.
3. It will get masked.
4. Your code will unmask and wake up from future edges but the edge
that already came in won't cause a wakeup, right?

Hrm, though I guess that's just a problem in general.  Probably
suspend_device_irq() should check to see if an IRQ is pending?  In any
case, at this point in time it's not a bug that is affecting me since
(right now) cros_ec sets the wakeup _before_ disabling, but it
probably should still be fixed.

So I tested this and it didn't seem to work.  I went into
cros_ec_suspend() and added a delay after the disable_irq() call.  I
pressed a key on my keyboard while the delay was happening.  When I
pressed the key I saw qcom_pdc_gic_mask() get called for the
interrupt.  ...and the suspend was _not_ aborted.  I watched and the
system continued all the way.

I watched the system go all the way down and shut down the CPUs.
Then, after 6 seconds (!) it woke back up.  I don't quite understand
it, but the 6 seconds here seems to be the time needed to wakeup if
PDC is enabled but the interrupt is masked at the gic level.

Digging a little deeper, I see that in irq_may_run() it was getting true for:

!irqd_has_set(&desc->irq_data, mask)

...and thus it was returning true for irq_may_run() without setting
irq_pm_check_wakeup().

Given that it's not working as you describe it to be working, I feel
like you might need to go back and re-evaluate your approach.  I'll
try to spend more time thinking about this tomorrow too, but I'm about
out of time for the day.

As per above, if nothing else you need to clarify things so people
aren't so confused.

I kinda ran out of time to dig more here, but it still worries me.
I'll try to dig more tomorrow.  In any case, can't you just clear out
any erroneous IRQs at init time and make it symmetric?
