Yeah no we really don't. I think that was the point of the whole DFL
bus :)

Agreed.

Greg will.

Yeah I've thought about this some for the last few days, maybe it's
easier that way.

Tbh, there's so little code here even if we went with option 3 above
it's probably fairly short. It would set a better prcedent.

Xu, how do you feel about giving that a spin? See if option 3 will be
way more code.
