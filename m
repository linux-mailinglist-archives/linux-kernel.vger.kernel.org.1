I'd _really_ like to remove it, as I think it only serves to confuse people
on a topic that is confusing enough already. Paul's perfbook [1] already has
plenty of information about this, so I don't think we need to repeat that
here. I could add a citation, perhaps?

Yeah, sorry about that. It went missing somehow during the rebase, it seems.

I think you're asking about value prediction, and the implications it would
have on address-dependent loads where the address can itself be predicted.
I'm not aware of an CPUs where that is observable architecturally.

arm64 has some load instructions that do not honour address dependencies,
but I believe that's mainly to enable alternative cache designs for things
like non-temporal and large vector loads.
