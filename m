Agreed, I think that shrink_page_list() as Michal writes is a better place
for the page_may_be_dma_pinned() check. But other than that I agree it is
good to avoid all the unnecessary work of preparing a page for reclaim when
we can now check there's no hope of reclaiming it (at this time).

Yeah, I'm pretty sure the page ref check happens so late because earlier it
was impossible to tell whether there are "external" page references reclaim
cannot get rid of - filesystem may (but need not!) hold a page reference
for its private data, page tables will hold references as well, etc. Now
with page_may_be_dma_pinned() we can detect at least one class of external
references (i.e. pins) early so it's stupid not to do that.

I agree that with this change, some races will become much less likely for
some usecases. But as you say, it's not a full solution.
