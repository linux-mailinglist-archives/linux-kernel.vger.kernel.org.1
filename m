Well, can you please *do* think more thoroughly about what I wrote,
instead of pushing for an alternative patch on gut feeling alone?

Especially when you imply that this should be a stable patch.

Not only does your alternative patch not protect against the race you
are worried about, the race itself doesn't matter. Racing reclaimers
will write their competing views of the world into the shared state on
all other levels anyway.

And that's okay. If the configuration and memory usage is such that
there is at least one reclaimer that scans without any protection
(like a limit reclaimer), it's not a problem when a second reclaimer
that meant to do protected global reclaim will also do one iteration
without protection. It's no different than if a second thread had
entered limit reclaim through another internal allocation.

There is no semantical violation with the race in your patch or the
race in this patch. Any effective protection that becomes visible is
1) permitted by the configuration, but 2) also triggered *right now*
by an acute need to reclaim memory with these parameters.

The *right now* part is important. That's what's broken before either
patch, and that's what we're fixing: to see really, really *old* stale
that might not be representative of the config semantics anymore.

Since you haven't linked to my email, here is my counter argument to
the alternative patch "fixing" this race somehow.

A reclaim:

  root
     `- A (low=2G, max=3G -> elow=0)
        `- A1 (low=0G -> elow=0)

Global reclaim:

  root
     `- A (low=2G, max=3G -> elow=2G)
        `- A1 (low=0G -> elow=2G)

During global reclaim, A1 is supposed to have 2G effective low
protection. If A limit reclaim races, it can set A1's elow to
0. Global reclaim will now query mem_cgroup_protection(root, A1), the
root == memcg check you insist we add will fail and it'll reclaim A1
without protection.

The alternative patch is nothing except slightly worse code.
