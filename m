Thanks for taking your time to review this. For new replicator behaving
unreasonably, I think the assumption that the context is not lost on
disabling clock is flawed since its implementation defined. Is such
assumption documented in any TRM?

So here I have a doubt as to why we need to use UCI because PID = 
0x2bb909
and CID = 0xb105900d are same for both replicators, so UCI won't 
identify the
different replicators(in same implementation i.e., on QCOM) here.
Am I missing something?

Thats why I think Suzuki suggested to use PIDR4_DES2 and check for QCOM 
impl
and add a workaround for all replicators, something like below: (will 
need cleaning)

#define PIDR4_DES2	0xFD0

if (FIELD_GET(GENMASK(3, 0), readl_relaxed(drvdata->base + PIDR4_DES2)) 
== 0x4)
	id0val = id1val = 0xff;

... and the rest as you suggested.

Thanks for this detailed idea for workaround. I will add this once we
know whether we need to use UCI or PIDR4_DES2.

I would defer this to experts as you or suzuki will have more idea
regarding this than me.

Thanks,
