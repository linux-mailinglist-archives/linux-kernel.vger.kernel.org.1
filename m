I didn't see anything wrong as such, it's mostly a mechanical
conversion. The one slight caveat is the potential change in cache
location for the statistics but it's not necessarily negative. The stats
potentially move to a different cache line but it's less obvious whether
that even matters given the location is very similar.

There is increased overhead now when schedstats are *enabled* because
_schedstat_from_sched_entity() has to be called but it appears that it is
protected by a schedstat_enabled() check. So ok, schedstats when enabled
are now a bit more expensive but they were expensive in the first place
so does it matter?

I'd have been happied if there was a comparison with schedstats enabled
just in case the overhead is too high but it could also do with a second
set of eyeballs.

It's somewhat tentative but
