Another option is to limit the bailing out to newidle balancing (as the
patchset currently stands, it isn't checking the right rq for global
balancing anyway).  On RT the softirq runs from thread context, so enabling
interrupts and (on RT) preemption should suffice to avoid latency problems
in the global rebalance.
