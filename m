Subject: [PATCH v2 2/2] hwspinlock: add sunxi hardware spinlock support
Message-ID: <c03d114477b887048ea0348dbfd1adb53c139e9f.1607094989.git.wilken.gottwalt@posteo.net>

Adds the sunxi_hwspinlock driver for the hardware spinlock unit found in
most of the sun8i and sun50i based SoCs.

This unit provides at least 32 spinlocks in hardware. The implementation
supports 32, 64, 128 or 256 32bit registers, where one lock can be taken
by reading a register and released by writing a 0 to it. This driver
supports all 4 spinlock setups, but for now only the first setup (32
locks) seem to exist in available devices. This spinlock unit is shared
between all ARM cores and the embedded OpenRisc AR100 core, all of them
can take/release a lock with a single cycle operation. It can be used to
sync access to devices shared by the ARM cores and the OpenRisc core.

There are two ways to check if a lock is taken. The first way is to read
a lock. If a 0 is returned, the lock was free and is taken now. If an 1
is returned, the caller has to try again, which means the lock is
currently taken. The second way is to read a 32bit wide status register
where every bit represents one of the 32 first locks. According to the
datasheets this status register supports the 32 first locks only. For
this reason the lock read/write approach is used in this driver which
can cover all 256 locks in the biggest setup.

Being able to use the status register to get knowledge about the locks
makes it suitable to extended testing. It also can be used to bypass
the Linux hwspinlock ABI completely and is not able to set locks. This
is used in one of the tests to show that the driver works correctly.

To run all tests it is necessary to take locks on the OpenRisc core and
show on the Linux side that the locks were taken by an external event.
This can be achived by using the crust firmware. For this the crust
firmware needs to be changed to take and release spinlocks (a simple
MMIO operation on the hwlock registers), which is currently not
supported by the current crust firmware. The necessary crust fork can
be found here https://github.com/wgottwalt/crust (hwspinlock branch).
It is also necessary to build u-boot with support for this crust/SCP
firmware. This u-boot fork can be found here
https://github.com/crust-firmware/u-boot (crust branch). For testing
this driver it is also necessary to pick a device that is fully
supported by crust. In this case a H5 based device works very well. In
this test a Friendlyarm NanoPi NEO2 was used, which is fully supported
by u-boot (also the fork) and current Linux kernels. In the crust fork
it is necessary to go into debug menu of "make nconfig" and select the
hwspinlock test loop, which uses the timeout functions of the crust
firmware. It loops through the first 32 spinlocks and takes/releases a
lock one after another using a timeout which can be set in the debug
menu.

Test 1:
This test was done with a mainline u-boot and a crust enabled u-boot.
For this a simple second kernel module was used, found here
https://github.com/wgottwalt/sunxi_hwspinlock/tree/main/test_module.

If run with mainline u-boot it shows that the Linux side correctly
takes a lock, tries to recursively take a lock again (which does not
happen) and releases a lock. Done for all 32 locks several times.

Same test run with the hwspinlock test loop enabled in crust. Here the
test module hits two locks exactly in the moment crust switches from
lock 7 to 8. The test module code path is slower because of more code
that needs to be executed which makes this rare scenario possible.

Test 2:
This is a more complex test that uses the status register to bypass the
Linux hwspinlock ABI. For this to work a slightly modified driver is
used and can be found here
https://github.com/wgottwalt/sunxi_hwspinlock/tree/main/
modified_sunxi_hwspinlock
This modified driver splits the 4K memory range into two and leaves the
status register untouched, so that it can be used by another test kernel
module which can be found here
https://github.com/wgottwalt/sunxi_hwspinlock/tree/main/test2_module
It is also necessary to change the device tree entries to get both
kernel modules working in parallel.

hwspinlock-mod@1c18000 {
        compatible = "allwinner,sun50i-hwspinlock-mod";
        reg = <0x01c18000 0x4 0x01c18100 0x400>;
        clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_SPINLOCK>;
        clock-names = "ahb";
        resets = <&ccu RST_BUS_SPINLOCK>;
        reset-names = "ahb";
        status = "okay";
};

hwspinlock-stat@1c18010 {
        compatible = "allwinner,sun50i-hwspinlock-stat";
        reg = <0x01c18010 0x4>;
        status = "okay";
};

The extended test kernel module supports 4 different modes of the test,
2 of them are sufficient to show the spinlock mechanism working.

Mode 1:
This one reads and prints the status register continuously. The crust
firmware and the test are set to a hwlock timeout of 1 second. The test
kernel module code runs a bit slower because of more code executed and
you can see how one lock is missed between entry 2 and 3.

Mode 3:
This mode combines the Linux hwspinlock ABI approach from test 1 and the
status register access. The "after" reads show the locks taken by the
Linux driver and the crust firmware.
