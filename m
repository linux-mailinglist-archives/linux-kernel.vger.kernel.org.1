Thanks this describes the underlying problem. I would be also explicit
that the issue should be visible only on tail memcgs which have both
max/high and protection configured and the effect depends on the
difference between the two (the smaller it is the largrger the effect).

There is no mention about the fix. The patch resets effective values for
the reclaim root and I've had some concerns about that
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200424162103.GK11591@dhcp22.suse.cz.
Johannes has argued that other races are possible and I didn't get to
think about it thoroughly. But this patch is introducing a new
possibility of breaking protection. If we want to have a quick and
simple fix that would be easier to backport to older kernels then I
would feel much better if we simply workedaround the problem as
suggested earlier http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200423061629.24185-1-laoar.shao@gmail.com
We can rework the effective values calculation to be more robust against
races on top of that because this is likely a more tricky thing to do.
