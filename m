Hi Thomas,

This is a combo pull request for the first two two batches of fixes
for 5.9. The most important part is that the whole "let's build
irqchips as platform devices" series has broken users' platforms as
the end-points drivers are not equipped to deal with the semi-random
probe ordering. There is work in progress to fix it, but in the
meantime let's go back to something that doesn't set the world on
fire. I have kept the helpers around to serve as a base for that
future work, but the callers are now back to their original state.

We also have two interesting fixes: one avoiding losing interrupts
when there is more that a single one pending with STM32 exti, and a
wakup interrupt issue with the Ingenic driver.

The rest of it is what I was hinting at when I sent the original 5.9
pull request, with a bunch of TI updates that deal with the change of
their firmware interface. The handling of the dependencies was bad
enough that I couldn't send it before -rc1 was out...

Please pull,

	M.

  irqchip/ingenic: Leave parent IRQ unmasked on suspend (2020-08-25 10:59:29 +0100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
irqchip fixes for Linux 5.9, take #2

- Revert the wholesale conversion to platform drivers of the
  pdc, sysirq and cirq drivers, as it breaks a number of
  platforms even when the driver is built-in (probe ordering
  bites you).

- Prevent interrupt from being lost with the STM32 exti driver

- Fix wake-up interrupts for the MIPS Ingenir driver

irqchip fixes for Linux 5.9, take #1

- Fix an embarassing typo in the new module helpers, leading
  to the probe failing most of the time

- The promised TI firmware rework that couldn't make it into
  the merge window due to a very badly managed set of dependency
