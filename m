Until one week ago, this was not possible, because SPDX headers
were broken for GFDL:

	https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/686
	https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/970

There are 2 types of GFDL licenses:
	- a Free license where the entire document allows
	  reviewing/changing;
	- a non-free variant, were some parts of the document
	  have a non-free license, where only the author can
	  change (called invariant parts).

Basically, some distro policies don't allow shipping documents
under the non-free version of GFDL.

The SPDX spec (up to version 3.9) doesn't allow differentiating
between them.

-

There's now an upstream patch (at SPDX) to be merged on the upcoming
versin 3.10 that will allow us to finally get rid of those:

	https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/pull/1048/commits/f695d2ac65230d0f4161ba58fff2f9d87bb5a053#diff-b948674e5c5cf6341e44e76b2565e80c

The GFDL-1.2 with no invariant sections is defined as:

	<SPDXLicenseCollection xmlns="http://www.spdx.org/license">
	  <license licenseId="GFDL-1.2-only-no-invariants" isOsiApproved="false"
	  name="GNU Free Documentation License v1.2 only - no invariants">
	    <crossRefs>
	      <crossRef>https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/fdl-1.2.txt</crossRef>

	      This license was released November 2002. The identifier

Ah, right. I'll fix it.

It should actually be:

	"GPL-2.0 OR GFDL-1.2-only-no-invariants"
