Sorry for the late response. I think the general direction you are
taking is fine but there are still some open questions. I am trying to
reason if 'address space' is general enough abstraction for different
types of monitoring targets. It fits well for the 'processes' targets.
For the physical memory, the monitoring part of the abstraction (i.e.
damon_ctx) seems fine but I am not sure about the optimization part
(i.e. [merge|split]_regions) which raises the question that should the
merge/split functionality be part of the abstraction.

I am also very interested in the 'cgroups' as the target and I am not
sure if 'address space' is the right abstraction for the cgroups as
well. Well we can think of cgroups as a combination of tasks but
cgroup also contains unmapped pages. So, maybe it is a combination of
virtual and physical address space targets damon can monitor but I am
still not clear how to specify that in the abstractions provided by
damon. Anyways these are the questions for later and we can start
simple with just processes but I would like to not expose these
abstractions/interfaces to userspace otherwise it would be really hard
to change later.

Another topic I want to discuss is managing/charging the resource
(cpu) usage of monitoring. Yes, damon with optimization has low cpu
cost but as the number of targets increase the cpu cost will increase
which will be in a range which can not be ignored as system overhead.
At the moment, it seems like there is one kthread doing all the
monitoring, since we can control the cpu usage of kthreads, it might
make sense to allow different kthreads for different sets of targets
(processes in a cgroup).
