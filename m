This patch would disable the IRQ line and if IRQ lines are shared 
between BHI
and MHI, we would not see handling of BHI related work happen.

Discussed this with Hemant and and as I am dropping the previous patch, 
will update
this one to make it free_irq() instead which removes the IRQ handler and 
does not
disable the interrupt line.

The function mhi_deinit_free_irq() will not be called from 
mhi_power_down() and
instead, only a free for the main IRQ handler will be called.
