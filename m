It handles restart, halt, poweroff the same way.  I wonder if anyone
would want to distinguish them.

The others handle only panic or oops.

What about splitting the reason into two variables? One for severity
and other for shutdown behavior. I mean:

  + reason: panic, oops, emergency, shutdown    (ordered by severity)
  + handling: restart, halt, poweroff

Or we might just replace KMSG_DUMP_RESTART, KMSG_DUMP_HALT,
KMSG_DUMP_POWEROFF with a single KMSG_DUMP_SHUTDOWN.

Then the max reason variable would make sense.
