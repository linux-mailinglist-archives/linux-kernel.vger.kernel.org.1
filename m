BTW there is one other independent thing that came to my attention when I tried
to fix the ptrace deadlock from user space, which I tried first.

In order to break the deadlock from user space the strace program would have
to be rewitten to be multi-threaded.  I tried that, but the problem was,
that an event from the tracee can be received either in the main thread,
or a signal handler, or another thread.  I tried to implement both possibilities,
see my strace-patches which I pointed out previously here.

The signal handler approach completely failed, and the second thread
approach did not completely fail but was just definitely insane.

What really makes it impossible to write a multi-threaded strace program,
is that *only* the tread that made PTRACE_ATTACH can do all the other
PTRACE-APIs, but for a multi-treaded strace, any thread should be able
to call PTRACE-APIs as long as we are in the same process.

I don't know if that is really hard to achieve, but it seems like something
that would allow user space much more flexibility.

What do you think?


Thanks
Bernd.
