I'll leave this one open to bikeshed arguments.

As I asked you yesterday over the call, it may help if you could share
some numbers to back up the doomsday scenario.
I don't believe mailbox will be a bottleneck, unless you send commands
in a while(1) ... but even then you have to compare against the
virtual-channel implementation. (Not to forget one usually doesn't
need/want the dvfs, power, clock, hotplug all happening at the _same_
time)

Please note, SCMI... lets not pretend it is not about making scmi work
with mhu :) ...  itself uses shared-memory transfers and
wait_for_completion_timeout  in scmi_do_xfer().   If some platform
_really-really_ faced speed bottlenecks, it would come to want to
exchange 32-bit encoded command/response over the mhu register,
asynchronously and totally bypassing shmem... which is possible only
now.

I am afraid you are confused. You can use bit/doorbell-6 by passing
0x40 to mhu as the data to send.

Cheers!
