That should just be fixed up to use the misc device interface, I'll put
it on my list of things to fix...

Does anyone still care/use pcmcia drivers?  I doubt you will ever run
this code :)

TPM is a valid class, nothing is wrong with that.

Those too are fine, nothing broken with them.

The code is working just fine as-is, nothing is broken.  By adding
unneeded complexity, it will be more unstable.

Not to mention the first attempt didn't even get it correct, which if I
had accepted, would have _introduced_ a bug for no reason at all.

Again, if you have an in-kernel user that wants to somehow create a
class dynamically off of the stack like your example showed, I will be
glad to revisit this, after I review that driver's code.
