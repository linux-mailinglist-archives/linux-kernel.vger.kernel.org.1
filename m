On ST side, This is something we plan to integrate in the TTY over RPMSG support.
The use case is the support of multi-instances. We already provided to our
customer a TTY service supporting it but without name extension. 
Some feed-backs are: how can we know which TTY instances to use to communicate
to the expected remote application in case of multi-instance.
A concrete example would be one instance to control a remote processor
application, the other instance to get the remote system logs.

Then in rpmsg TTY proposed for upstream the extension could also been used to
differentiate the data from the control channels, as discussed with Mathieu
during reviews: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/4/3/964. 
Means the service is the TTY, the sub-services are the data and the control.

An other usecase i have in mind is the management of the rpmsg flow control for
the QOS.
This could be reused to create a core flow control manager based on the
service extension, which could be quite smooth in term of legacy support.

Suman and Xiang(added in CC) have probably also some usecases as they 
proposed similar patches...

Arnaud
