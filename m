Just to be that guy, how about kdump, where entry to the second kernel 
is predicated on there *not* being a nice clean shutdown? ;)

IMO relying on any particular bootloader behaviour in the kernel is 
fairly fragile - U-Boot has a lot more latitude in assuming it's running 
straight out of reset than Linux does. If we're not going to trust the 
DT to correctly describe the SoC variant in the first place, then it's 
somewhat questionable whether we should trust it for indirectly 
identifying the SoC variant either - it would seem a lot more robust to 
just map the known physical addresses to run a canned sequence of 
register writes that puts things in a known-good state (on the basis 
that this has to run before the 'real' drivers for those things are up, 
and thus can't interfere with them).
