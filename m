Some group internal at Intel want something like this, but more extensive,
They want to limit RDMSR to a subset (not exactly sure why, I don't
know of MSRs that have side effects on read ... but then again
not all of the MSR space is documented).

On the write side they divide into categories:
1) Some MSRs can only be cleared.
2) Some MSRs can only have certain bits set
3) Some MSRs allow any write
4) Maybe something else ... this is from memory, and a somewhat
cursory read of their patch.

They have maybe a couple of dozen MSRs split between those classes.
