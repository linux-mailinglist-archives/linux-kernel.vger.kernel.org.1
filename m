Here by Software flow control i meant, we can control the flow from 
SW(explained below).

CTS and RX are inputs to the HOST whereas RTS and TX are outputs. We 
have added drive-strength for output pins only as they are driven by 
UART(please correct me if wrong).

yes, you are right, we are keeping RTS low to make sure that BT SoC can 
wakeup the system by sending bytes.
My intention here was to explain below case from your comment:

>> > RTS is an active low signal, hence by configuring it as a pull-down the
>> > BT
>> > SoC can send data regardless of whether the host UART actually asserts

>> > so the host UART may not be ready to receive it.

1. By default our HW flow is enabled(since we are configuring pull-down 
on RTS),and BT SoC can send data anytime.
2. But there is a SW mechanism where we can control the flow from 
software. In that case what ever is configured to UART_MANUAL_RFR(READY 
or NOT_READY) will override the dtsi pinconf pull and the RTS/RFR line 
is pulled high when HOST is not ready(while debugging the wake up issue 
we came across this).

So, as far as i understand, even if pull-down is configured on RTS, BT 
SoC can send data only when HOST is ready.
Can you please let me know which case you mean here, when you say "by 
configuring it as a pull-down the BT SoC can send data regardless of 
whether the host UART actually asserts RTS". Is there any case which we 
are missing here?
