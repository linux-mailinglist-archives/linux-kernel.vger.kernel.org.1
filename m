On x86, all stores become visible in-order globally.

I suspect that
means any pending stores in the queue
would become visible to the rest of the system before
the store to the "current" cpu-local variable, as
well as other writes from the context switch code
become visible to the rest of the system.

Is that too naive a way of preventing the scenario you
describe?

What am I overlooking?
