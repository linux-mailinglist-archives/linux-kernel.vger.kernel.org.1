I just meant that the binary build should not depend on anything outside
the directory. It should be able to be built if you just copy the
ftracetest directory and run there.

OK, I'll change it to UNRESOLVED. One reason I used UNTESTED, is that the
build wont happen until libtracefs is packaged and released (or you
download and build it yourself). And it's just getting ready now. So in
essence, this is currently just a "placeholder" ;-)
