I believe right about the time that Eric Paris was stepping away from
SELinux he was working on a patchset that basically did what you
describe: copy-on-write for the SELinux inode blobs (aka
inode_security_struct, aka isec, etc.).  Unfortunately I don't believe
that work was ever finished and the idea was lost many years ago in
the maintainer shuffle; I was trying to figure out this whole
"maintainer thing" and perhaps didn't push Eric to post those patches
as much as I should have.  Although it's a big academic now with the
LSM stacking work.

Most of my SELinux thoughts these days are around the correctness and
robustness of the code, making sure we are testing as much as possible
(related to the first point), and trying to catch changes in other
subsystems which cause us breakage.  Not the most glamorous stuff, but
it's important.  SELinux is lucky enough to have a few active kernel
developers, and thankfully a couple of them appear to be looking at
some of the performance issues.

Yeah.  It's pretty much impossible now to do copy-on-write with the
main security blobs due to the differing nature of the LSMs and the
single, shared allocation for each blob.  I suppose if you wanted to
attempt copy-on-write inside a LSM you could introduce another layer
of pointers/allocation, but I'm not sure how much of an improvement
that might be.

Perhaps a bit more thought will produce a "eureka!" moment, but I'm
not overly optimistic.

I don't want to get into the "security people can't agree on anything"
discussion, but I think for that to work all of the loaded LSMs would
need to agree that they don't need to stash anything in the inode (or
other object); which I think is pretty much impossible most of the
time.  At least in the SELinux case, even if we were doing some sort
of copy-on-write, we would need to keep a reference back to the inode
security blob that does contain our needed info.
