Correct.  shmem_unused_huge_shrink() is not memcg aware.  In response to
memcg pressure it will split the post-i_size tails of nr_to_scan tmpfs
inodes regardless of if they're charged to the under-pressure memcg.
do_shrink_slab() looks like it'll repeatedly call
shmem_unused_huge_shrink().  So it will split tails of many inodes.  So
I think it'll avoid the oom by over shrinking.  This is not ideal.  But
it seems better than undeserved oom kill.

I think the solution (as Kirill Tkhai suggested) a memcg-aware index
would solve both:
1) avoid premature oom by registering shrinker to responding to memcg
   pressure
2) avoid shrinking/splitting inodes unrelated to the under-pressure
   memcg

I can certainly look into that (thanks Kirill for the pointers).  In the
short term I'm still interested in avoiding premature OOMs with the
original thread (i.e. restore pre-4.19 behavior to shmem shrinker for
memcg pressure).  I plan to test and repost v2.
