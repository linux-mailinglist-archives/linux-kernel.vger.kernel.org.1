I'm undecided about this ... and while thinking about this,
realized that we already have some changes doing that in the tree.

To explain, in general the pinctrl names should come from the names used
in the actual device schematics, as this makes it easier to find and compare
them between devicetree and schematics files.

So creating an arbitrary foo_led_pin pinctrl instead breaks this searchability
which I'd really like to keep.
