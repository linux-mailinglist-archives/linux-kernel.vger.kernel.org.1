gma500 could keep it's own property, without the "Automatic" value. We've
done tricks like this for other properties too.

Yeah just pick one, and implement the others as aliases. Drivers can do
the aliases in their atomic_get/set_property functions pretty easily,
atomic properties aren't stored anywhere else than decoded (which was done
partially to make stuff like this work).

Coming up a new property name just so that everyone suffers equally feels
silly.
