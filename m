So the dma_resv_reserve_shared() call in qxl_release_validate_bo() is
unbalanced?  Because the dma_resv_unlock() call in
qxl_release_fence_buffer_objects() never happens due to
qxl_release_free_list() clearing the list beforehand?  Is that correct?

The only way I see for this to happen is that the guest is preempted
between qxl_push_{cursor,command}_ring_release() and
qxl_release_fence_buffer_objects() calls.  The host can complete the qxl
command then, signal the guest, and the IRQ handler calls
qxl_release_free_list() before qxl_release_fence_buffer_objects() runs.

Looking through the code I think it should be safe to simply swap the
qxl_release_fence_buffer_objects() +
qxl_push_{cursor,command}_ring_release() calls to close that race
window.  Can you try that and see if it fixes the bug for you?

The commit message doesn't explain this chunk.

take care,
