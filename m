I'd say that's life in upper layers to optimize special (!) use cases. :)

I remember even suggesting to focus on hugetlbfs during your KVM talk
when chatting. Maybe I was not clear before.

Exactly, that's my point. Some people might still disagree with the
hugetlbfs approach, but there it's easier to add tunables without
affecting the overall system.
