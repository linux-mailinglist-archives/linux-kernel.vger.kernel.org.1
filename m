In kernel, we only support things that are in mainline, else we don't
care about them. That's the general rule. And yeah I understand that
this is early support for a new hardware, and so it is better to add
code for things we are sure about.

I think even that is fine, if there is a problem to be solved it needs
to be solved, big or small doesn't really matter. Just that it needs
to be there in mainline.

Exactly, and so people normally prefer to keep things simple until the
time the needs arises for the same. A patch can be added later, its no
big deal. But it should be added when we need it.

Yeah, small or big doesn't really matter.

I won't try to force you to remove this piece and will leave it for
you to decide.

But, I don't see a future system in mainline which uses AMU but
doesn't have cpufreq for all its CPUs. And so I won't have kept code
for that, even if it is just 2 lines. We can always add it back when
required.

Thanks for the review again Ionela.
