I look at it in scope of GFP_ATOMIC/GFP_NOWAIT issues, i.e. inability
to provide a memory service for contexts which are not allowed to
sleep, RCU is part of them. Both flags used to provide such ability
before but not anymore.

Do you agree with it?

If you agree with above, then there is a reasonable question what to
do. Converting zone->lock into raw variant, the simplest and generic
solution, has been declined(RT people do not like and see a side effect),
NO_LOCK flag together with lock-less function were declined. All those
efforts in terms of suggestions were just to find the best way to go.
That is why we highlighted it outside of RCU.

If you do not agree, then at least a documentation of mentioned flags
should be changed, IMHO. We are, in our turn will focus on fixing it
differently.

Agree on that, async refilling has its disadvantages.

We have only synthetic tests. As for real life scenarios, on highly
loaded servers we will have one picture, on small devices like phones
we will have another one. As i mentioned in my previous emails, in worst
case on my system it requires ~400 pages to cover the bandwidth.

But, again we would like to find the best way to go. As i mentioned
if Thomas patches are in place, we do not need to workaround everything
regarding dynamic caching or async preloading and so on.

Thank you Michal!
