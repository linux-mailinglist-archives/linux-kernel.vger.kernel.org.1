This is quite similar to currently proposed design options.
Saying expensive how do you estimate the cost?

Important thing with all this is to have atomic poll() on
all fds signalling to the tool in order to avoid tricky races
and complicated design covering them.

Signals can also be consumed via fd and recent pidfd kernel
extension can be subject for this general atomic poll().

So ideally it should look like this:
fdarray__poll(events_fds + ctl_fds + pid_fd + signal_fds)
