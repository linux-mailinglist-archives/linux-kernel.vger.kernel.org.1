Hmm, the current patchset has different problem. The continuation
pieces are correctly passed as a single lines. But empty line is
printed for each unused sequence number to avoid warnings about
missed messages in journactl. It looks like:

I am afraid that this not acceptable for Linus either because people
will report bugs and complain about regression.

Slightly better solution is to skip the unused sequence numbers. It
looks good in both dmesg/journalctl by default. Note that journalctl
shows the warnings about missing lines "only" with "-a" option.
Sigh, but I am afraid that this is still not acceptable.


Hmm, I can't find any simple or even working solution for maintaining
a monotonic sequence number a lockless way that would be the same
for all stored pieces.

I am afraid that the only working solution is to store all pieces
in a single lockless transaction. I think that John already
proposed using 2nd small lockless buffer for this. The problem
might be how to synchronize flushing the pieces into the final
buffer.

Another solution would be to use separate buffer for each context
and CPU. The problem is a missing final "\n". It might cause
that a buffer is not flushed for a long time until another
message is printed in the same context on the same CPU.

The 2nd small logbuffer looks like a better choice if we
are able to solve the lockless flush.

Best Regards,
Petr
