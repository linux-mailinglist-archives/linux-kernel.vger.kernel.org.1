That is exactly the problem with vmalloc_sync_mappings()/unmappings().
It is not at all clear when it needs to be called and why, or even who
needs is responsible for calling it. The existing call-sites in Notifier
and ACPI code have no comment on why it is necessary to synchronize the
vmalloc mappings there.

It is only needed for x86, we could also get rid of it completely if:

	1) At x86-64 we pre-allocate all 64 P4D/PUD pages for the
	   vmalloc area in init_mm at boot time. This needs 256kb of
	   memory per system, most of it potentially unused as each
	   P4D/PUD maps 512GB of address space.

	2) At x86-32 we need to disable large pages for vmalloc/ioremap
	   mappings and pre-allocate the PTE pages for the vmalloc area
	   in init_mm. Depending on how much memory the system has and
	   the configured kernel/user split this might take more than 64
	   pages.

With that we could get rid of the vmalloc_sync interface and also the
vmalloc-fault code in general and reduce the complexity. This interface
has caused problems more than once. On the other side it would trade
memory usage against complexity.
