It is possible to achieve this functionality with memory.high with
some config/sysctls e.t.c as you suggested but it can bloat and
complicate the memory.high interface.

I understand your concern with different kinds of soft memory limits
but I see this as a simple interface (i.e. just trigger reclaim) that
gives users the flexibility to define and (soft) enforce their own
virtual limits on their jobs. More specifically this interface allows
reclaiming from a job to keep the usage below some virtual limit which
can correspond to some user defined metric. In my proactive reclaim
example, the user defined metric is refault rates. Keep the usage of
the job at a level where the refault rates are tolerable.
