With "modern-ish" actually meaning: "desktop/gaming/mobile-style
3D-accelerated wide-color display hardware".  There's plenty of display
hardware that doesn't fall into that class, and is served by fbdev (also
out-of-tree due to the moratorium) because of that.

When an oops happens, all bets are off...
