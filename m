Cool, I'll try to do that then, thanks!

I see two ways to do that though:

1. Create a device driver that gets a reference to the memory region
from its DT node and then re-adds the memory to the pool of available
memory.

2. Use a special "compatible" string for my memory region and create a
driver to handle it.

However, I think that in the second case the driver must be builtin.
Would that be okay?

Also, from a quick look, it seems that I can re-add that memory back by
calling memblock_free() (or a similar memblock_* function). Am I on the
right track?

Yes, you're very right. Drivers that do DMA transfers to statically
allocated memory inside the kernel will be broken.

We are currently seeing this with our eMMC driver.

Current solution is to add the eMMC controller to the list of allowed
"agents" for the IMR. This will reduce the level of protection, but
since we expect to have only a few of these exceptions (since, as you
pointed out, drivers that do DMA to static kernel memory seem to be
quite rare), we think that there is still value in having the Kernel
IMR.

Do you see any issue with this?

Daniele
