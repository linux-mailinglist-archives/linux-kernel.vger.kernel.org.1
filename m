Yes, I will rewrite commit log in the following patch.

It seems to me that check for overflow on sum of to_ratio(rt_period, rt_runtime) is not necessary. As to_ratio() of a rt group is bounded by global_rt_period() and global_rt_runtime() due to the checks in tg_rt_schedulable(). And global_rt_runtime() is not allowed to be greater than global_rt_period() thanks to sched_rt_global_validate(). Thus, to_ratio() of a rt group will not exceed BW_UNIT, sum of which is unlikely to overflow then. Checks against rt_runtime overflow during to_ratio is still needed.

Is that correct?

Yes, the limit for rt_runtime is in nsec. This should be changed.
