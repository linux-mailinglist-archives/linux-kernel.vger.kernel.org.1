I remember when the temporary page code was added for page migration.
The use of temporary page here was added at about the same time.  Temporary
page does have one advantage in that it will not CAUSE surplus count to
exceed overcommit.  This patch could cause surplus to exceed overcommit
for a very short period of time.  However, do note that for this to happen
the code needs to race with a pool resize which itself could cause surplus
to exceed overcommit.

IMO both approaches are valid.
- Advantage of temporary page is that it can not cause surplus to exceed
  overcommit.  Disadvantage is as mentioned in the comment 'abuse of temporary
  page'.
- Advantage of this patch is that it uses existing counters.  Disadvantage
  is that it can momentarily cause surplus to exceed overcommit.

Unless someone has a strong opinion, I prefer the changes in this patch.
