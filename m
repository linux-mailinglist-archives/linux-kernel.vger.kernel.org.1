I had tried level and trigger flow handlers and was always getting weird ha=
ngs,
so never even attempted that, but with that handler I do get the Ack calls =
now.

I'm still missing the interrupts, so I'm starting to believe I'm just
doing something
else wrong.

Yes! I totally agree this is silly, but I'm pretty sure that's how it
works. I will
try to reach out to the SoC team to double check, but from their documentat=
ion,
they say the interrupt line will stay asserted as long as the doorbell stat=
us
value is different than 0, so until we manually clear it, it stays asserted=
.

Thanks again Marc!
Let me try to reach out to the SoC guys and try to figure out what
else I'm doing
wrong. I will give you an update once I figure it out.
