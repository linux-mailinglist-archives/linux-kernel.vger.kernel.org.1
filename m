The (Red Hat sponsored) Enarx project will continue building an
unofficial, unsupported version of the Fedora kernel with the SGX
patches[0] until such time as the patches are upstream. Once upstream,
I intend to propose that the feature be enabled in the stock Fedora
kernel.

Enarx requires EDMM support as a prerequisite to being production
ready. Therefore, we are likely to continue building this custom
Fedora kernel with the latest patches until such point as EDMM support
lands upstream. This also implies that I have no current plan to
request an SGX backport to a RHEL kernel until such time as it
supports our full needs.

Disclaimer: I do not control RHEL or Fedora kernel features. None of
the above constitutes a commitment to deliver anything.
