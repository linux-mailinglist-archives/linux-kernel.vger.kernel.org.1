I wanted to avoid touching common code to make it work for purgatory
for now.

kexec_file_load could as well be used without IMA or secureboot. With sha256 digest
calculated anyway, verifying it would make sense to accommodate that case as well.

Agreed. But I prefer to work on PIE and/or moving common relocation_add code
for x86 & s390 to generic code later when I try to build on these purgatory
changes. So, a separate series later to rework purgatory with the things you
mentioned above sounds ok?

Thanks
