With my x86 hat on, I have no particular expectation that you would be famil=
iar with the particular problems wi TV FSGSBASE. One sequence that will kill=
 the kernel is to use WRGSBASE to load a negative value (e.g. ~0), then set E=
FLAGS.TF and do SYSENTER. I=E2=80=99m adding a test like this to the x86 sel=
ftests.

One useful test for the actual kernel patches would be to run your SGX workl=
oad on a loaded core.  That is, do
something like taskset -c 0 graphene_thing and, simultaneously, write a triv=
ial infinite loop program and run that under taskset -c 0 as well. For good m=
easure, you could have perf top or perf record running at the same time.  Lo=
ok for kernel errors, but also look for any evidence of your workload malfun=
ctioning.
