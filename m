Yes, clock was shifted by one hour.

And what other can time synchronization daemon does?

Well, I think this is not related to chronyd. Any userspace application
may call adjtime(). It is not privilege that only chronyd is allowed to
use that syscall.

I agree that this is not a kernel problem.

But I'm asking, how my userspace application can measure time difference?
As I wrote CLOCK_MONITONIC is not suitable as it is affected by those
NTP adjustments and that is why I thought that CLOCK_MONITONIC_RAW is
better as it is not affected by these NTP problems.

But CLOCK_MONITONIC_RAW has a problem that is stopped during system
sleep and that is why I thought that CLOCK_BOOTTIME_RAW should be there.
