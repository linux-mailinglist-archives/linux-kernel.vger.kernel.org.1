Yes, lots of unnecessary reordering, but doing it only for deferred
probes IS the problem. In the example I gave, the consumer is never
deferred probe because the supplier happens to finish probing before
the consumer probe is even attempted.

I'm open to other suggestions, but I think this is needed for all the
cases or at least more cases to be handled correctly.

One alternative I was thinking was not adding the device to the
dpm_list until it's probed. But I have the vague feeling of other
things between device_add() and device probe that expect the device to
be in the dpm_list.
