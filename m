Yes, that'd be ideal.

As for the lifetime of the struct blk_keyslot_manager pointer DM would
manage (in your future code revision): you meantioned in one reply that
the request_queue takes care of setting up the ksm... but the ksm
is tied to the queue at a later phase using blk_ksm_register(). 

In any case, I think my feature reequest (to have DM allocate the ksm
struct only as needed) is a bit challenging because of how DM allocates
the request_queue upfront in alloc_dev() and then later completes the
request_queue initialization based on DM_TYPE* in dm_setup_md_queue().

It _could_ be that you'll need to add a new DM_TYPE_KSM_BIO_BASED or
something.  But you have a catch-22 in that the dm-table.c code to
establish the intersection of supported modes assumes ksm is already
allocated.  So something needs to give by reasoning through: _what_ is
the invariant that will trigger the delayed allocation of the ksm
struct?  I don't yet see how you can make that informed decision that
the target(s) in the DM table _will_ use the ksm if it exists.

But then once the ksm is allocated, it never gets allocated again
because md->queue->ksm is already set, and it inherits the lifetime that
is used when destroying the mapped_device (md->queue, etc).
