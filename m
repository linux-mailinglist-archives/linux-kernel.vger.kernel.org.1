This all depends on vendor customization to the firmware.
Normally Q6ASM supports up to 8 concurrent streams.

Yes, it is purely firmware limitation.

That is the direction, which should also include any dai specific 
properties like compressed case.

I don't think we need to limit this from Linux side, but Its important 
to take care of the max allowed Q6ASM dais w.r.t DSP.
