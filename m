Fair enough; please Cc me when you get to it.

Yeah, that's okay, you can do 'short' atomics using wider RmW.

I tend to agree, qspinlock only really makes sense when you have
multiple cache domains and NUMA makes it shine.

No. ticket locks are 'simple' and their implementation fairly straight
forward. Also, since the generic code only has cmpxchg, a generic ticket
lock would be sub-optimal on LL/SC (or even x86 for that matter).

It would look something like this, which I think is pretty terrible for
just about any arch compared to what you can do with inline asm.

struct ticket_lock {
	union {
		atomic_t	val;
		struct {
#ifdef __LITTLE_ENDIAN
			u16	head;
			u16	tail;
#else
			u16	tail;
			u16	head;
#endif
		};
	};
};

void ticket_lock(struct ticket_lock *lock)
{
	unsigned int val = atomic_read(&lock->val);
	struct ticket_lock lock;

	do {
		lock.val = ATOMIC_INIT(val);
		lock.head++;
	} while (!atomic_try_cmpxchg_relaxed(&lock->lock, &val, lock.val));

	atomic_cond_read_acquire(&lock->val, (VAL >> 16) == lock.head);
}

void ticket_unlock(struct ticket_lock *lock)
{
	atomic_fetch_inc_release(&lock->val);
}
