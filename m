Sorry for the late response. Was on holiday.

IMHO the above is a hack. Out-of-tree modules should rely on public headers and
exported functions only. What you propose means that people who want to use
these tracepoints in meaningful way must have a prebuilt kernel handy. Which is
maybe true for us who work in the embedded world. But users who run normal
distro kernels (desktop/servers) will fail to build against
`/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build` where that internal header file is not
exported. IOW, we're putting extra hoops for a large class of users here to be
able to access these internal data. They have to maintain their out-of-tree
definition of these structures.

FWIW, I did raise this concern with Peter in 2019 OSPM and he was okay with the
exports as it's still not a contract and they can disappear anytime we want.
Migrating to using BTF is the right way forward IMO. I don't think what we have
here is out-of-control yet. Though I agree they're annoying.

Cheers
