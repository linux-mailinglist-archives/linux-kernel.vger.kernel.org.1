Sure, but it would be significantly more complex, require a lot more code
and testing since there can be other userspace apps interacting with the
hardware, in addition to being less reliable and potentially difficult
to install
for some setups. Detecting and dealing with this issue in the kernel is
very simple and reliable in comparison. There's also potentially permissions
issues if one wants to do this from userspace from my understanding.

Yeah, I think it's mostly nonvolatile memory, I've seen this issue quite a bit
with some of the Realtek ethernet drivers.

I think user experience for devices should be that one can move
a USB device from Linux to Windows and back without having to manually
reprogram an eeprom. The sheer amount of resources FTDI has wasted
with their malicious Windows driver is crazy and likely far exceeds any losses
from counterfeiting. I think due to how widespread this issue is it makes sense
to aggressively and automatically mitigate the damages wherever possible, it's
also likely a major source of ewaste since people may throw out perfectly
functional hardware without knowing it can be fixed easily.
