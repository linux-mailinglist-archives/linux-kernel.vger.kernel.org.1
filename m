Correct, considering performance of in batch node flush, it will be better to
use pba as IV value.

But, what's the plan about supporting software encryption for metadata? Current
f2fs write flow will handle all operations which may encounter failure before
allocating block address for node, if we do allocation first, and then use pba
as IV to encrypt node block, it will be a little complicated to revert allocation
if we fail to encrypt node block.
