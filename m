In general, this is something we all have been collectively pushing on
for years. Our users running LXD run unprivileged containers by default.
The daemon requires you to explicitly request running privileged
containers. All Linux workloads on Chromebooks are LXD-based and are
thus run in fully unprivileged containers so are all workloads on
ppc/arm64/s390x on Travis.
And now we're finally also see more runC based container managers like
Podman/cri-o adopting unprivileged containers too. So this is becoming
more and more common and in the interest of security we have an
obligation to help push for more adoption.

and things like ldap, pam, or samba. The number is growing with
applications becoming more security aware. Here's an example from a user
reported bug:

Maybe running application containers that problem is not as pressing
immediately but for containers running full systems bug reports
involving high id allocations are pretty common
https://github.com/lxc/lxd/issues/2111

There's nothing wrong with dropping to high ids technically and we can't
really enforce userspace stick to a 65536 range.

I have another concrete proposal that I'm working on with Tycho, Serge,
and Aleksa and input from Seth hoping to have it ready somewhat soonish
after the merge window and I hope we can have a good discussion around
this.

We have seen this problem and received bug reports about this. It is
especially a concern on shared infrastructure such as on aforementioned
Travis workloads.

The idea was to use the overflow uid and gid and to introduce a new
sysctl that would allow an administrator to enforce that processes can't
setuid()/setgid() to the overflow uid or gid. The overflow uid and gid
are already configurable. This really does not seem that different from
seeing a bunch of extremely high-range uid and gids for unprivileged
containers in the ps output as we do today or even looking at a
filesystem from within a user namespace where the ids don't map.

I'm tempted to agree and say that it's safe to assume that they are used
very much. Negative acls have been brought up a couple of times in
related contexts though. One being a potential bug in newgidmap which we
discussed back in
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/shadow/+bug/1729357
But I think if we have this under a sysctl as proposed earlier is good
enough.

This looks sane and simple. I would still think that making it opt-in
for a few kernel releases might be preferable to just making it the new
default. We can then revisit flipping the default. Advanced enough
container runtimes will quickly pick up on this and can make it the
default for their unprivileged containers if they want to.
