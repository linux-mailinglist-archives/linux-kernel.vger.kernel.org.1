On a bit more consideration, I think that I have the model a bit
wrong.  We shouldn't think of this as a *syscall* filter but as a
filter for architectural privilege transitions in general.  After all,
there is no particular guarantee that any given emulated program has a
syscall ABI that is even remotely compatible with Linux.  So maybe the
filter is fed events like SYSCALL64, SYSCALL32, SYSENTER, #GP, #PF
(the bad kind that would otherwise get a signal), #UD, etc.  And the
filter can examine process state and take some reasonable action.
Think if it as a personality scheme that's programmable by user code.
I imagine that even schemes like NaCl could make some use of this.

This allows all kinds of interesting things.  For example, it should
give Wine a much nicer emulation of Windows SEH and vectored signals.
And maybe it could finally allow Linux userspace to have some sensible
equivalent of those Windows features -- being able to write library
code that could sanely handle, say, math errors would be quite handy.

This could be mocked up with cBPF, but I think a cBPF version will
struggle to be a performant solution for Wine because it will have a
hard time distinguishing between Windows and Linux syscalls.
