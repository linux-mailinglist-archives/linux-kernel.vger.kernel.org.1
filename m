Indeed, if there were other code paths doing that, they would most
likely also be broken (at least) for s390. Alexander was already
looking into generalizing the new gup-specific helpers, but so
far we assumed that would only be "nice to have" for the future,
and not fix any real issues at the moment. So we wanted to
focus on first fixing the very real gup_fast issue.

Both approaches here probably could be generalized, by either
changing pXd_address_end() or pXd_offset(), but I guess it makes
sense to already take into account that we might need such
generalization sooner than expected.

Just to make sure, you are referring to some future / planned
changes to mm/pagewalk.c, and not some currently existing
pagetable walkers already using the READ_ONCE logic w/o
spinlocks? If those would exist already, I guess we would
already have issues on s390, independent from our conversion
to common code gup_fast.

Gerald
