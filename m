As far as I can tell the only purpose of that was to make sure we were
sending 0.  Specifically "tx_buf" "rx_buf" both point to "phy->iobuf"
so setting the first byte to 0 here made sure that we weren't sending
out "random" data but were instead sending a 0.  After my change
"tx_buf" is NULL so we don't need to do this--the controller should
take charge of sending nothing on the lines (AKA sending a zero).

Does that answer your question, or were you worried about us needing
to init iobuf[0] to 0 in some other case?
