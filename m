Actually we don't, I added the disable for ETF/ETB for completeness 
since we are
adding shutdown callback for TMC devices and not just ETR although this 
issue applies
only for ETR and it doesn't hurt to disable these devices in shutdown 
path.

I have tested this with and without active trace sessions multiple times 
on 2 devices
and did not observe a single crash. The crash should be easily triggered 
as per
what you are saying if we have active sessions but I do not see any 
crash.

SMMU/IOMMU won't be able to do much here as it is the client's 
responsiblity to
properly shutdown and SMMU device link just makes sure that 
SMMU(supplier) shutdown is
called only after its consumers shutdown callbacks are called.
