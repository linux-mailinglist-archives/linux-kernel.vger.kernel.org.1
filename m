Indeed, it is also last patch in the series. However if Arnd is happy
with the sysfs names, we can move to generic code later without breaking
anything.

We need not revert or drop it now. I will leave that to you or Arnd to
decide. Just that it may be too late to get acks for all the soc sysfs
drivers in time for v5.8

I am fine if you want to drop the last patch.

/me confused. Do you need the fix for this warning or you are happy to ignore?
