This is exactly how our "per-memcg kswapd" works. The missing piece is
how to account the background worker (it is a kernel work thread)
properly as what we discussed before. You mentioned such work is WIP
in earlier email of this thread, I think once this is done the
per-memcg background worker could be supported easily.
