I wasn't completely sure I understood before I saw your reply on the 
next patch. I don't think it's too far, it's cleaner! The current way 
was good enough to deal with only two x86 specific objtool subcommands.

Since you're adding another one and it is likely that more will be added 
in the future, I think it's worth having something a bit more structured 
:) .

Good point. But since those are errors, you don't need the "else" :)

Yes but $(SKIP_STACK_VALIDATION) == 1 is actually just 
CONFIG_STACK_VALIDATION && ($(has_libelf) != 1). And since you are 
already in the ifneq ($(has_libelf),1) branch, checking 
$(SKIP_STACK_VALIDATION) == 1 is the same as CONFIG_STACK_VALIDATION 
being defined.

To me this is minor, we could also imagine another command CONFIG_ 
performing another action than warning or error when libelf is not 
available.

Anyway, this was just a suggestion, I don't want to insist to much on this.
