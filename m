Let's ignore writeback for a moment because get_page() is the more
general case.  The locking sequence is:

1. get_page() (or equivalent) "locks out" a page from converting to
   inaccessbile,
2. followed by a make_page_accessible() guarantees that the page
   *stays* accessible until
3. I/O is safe in this region
4. put_page(), removes the "lock out", I/O now unsafe

They key is, though, the get_page() must happen before
make_page_accessible() and *every* place that acquires a new reference
needs a make_page_accessible().

try_get_page() is obviously one of those "new reference sites" and it
only has one call site outisde of the gup code: generic_pipe_buf_get(),
which is effectively patched by the patch that started this thread.  The
fact that this one oddball site _and_ gup are patched now is a good sign.

*But*, I still don't know how that could work nicely:

>         return true;

If try_get_page() collides with a freeze_page_refs(), it'll hit the
WARN_ON_ONCE(), which is surely there for a good reason.  I'm not sure
that warning is _actually_ valid since freeze_page_refs() isn't truly a
0 refcount.  But, the fact that this hasn't been encountered means that
the testing here is potentially lacking.

Why do you think that's the extent of the problem?  Because the crashes
stopped?

I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you explained the audits that you've
performed or _why_ you think that.  What I've heard thus far is
basically that you've been able to boot a guest and you're ready to ship
this code.

Dang, I think I was looking at the TINY_RCU code, which is unfortunately
first in page_cache_get_speculative().  It doesn't support PREEMPT or
SMP, so it can take some shortcuts.

But, with regular RCU, you're right, it _does_ appear that it would hit
that retry loop, but then it would *succeed* in getting a reference.  In
the end, this just supports the sequence I wrote above:
arch_make_page_accessible() is only valid when called with an elevated
refcount and the refcount must be held to lock out make_secure_pte().

It actually happens transiently, at least.  I believe inode truncation
removes from the page cache before it zaps the PTEs.

I'm actually trying to figure out what to do with AMD's SEV.  The
current state isn't great and, for instance, allows userspace to read
guest ciphertext.  But, the pages come and go out of the encrypted state
at the behest of the guest, and the kernel needs *some* mapping for the
pages to do things like instruction emulation.

I started looking at s390 because someone said there was a similar
problem there and suggested the hooks might work.  I couldn't figure out
how they worked comprehensively on s390, and that's how we got here.
