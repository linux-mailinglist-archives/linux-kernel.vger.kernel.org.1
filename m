Typo? 4.14 meant?

Technically yes. Backporting 987351e1ea7772 to v4.19.x avoids the panic.
But it means integrating a v5.6 feature (isn't 987351e1ea7772 one?) into
the v4.19.x stable tree. Isn't v4.19.x (just like any other stable
branch) supposed to contain just fixes?

Should then any missing prerequisite features be pumped in into the
stable tree, whenever backporting a bugfix produces unexpected results?

FWIW I confirm that:
* setup [A] leads to the issue reported in [C]
* setup [B] resolves the issue reported in [C]

[A] v4.19 + 16bdc04cc98 + 1cb3b0095c3 + 79112cc3c29f
[B] v4.19 + 16bdc04cc98 + 1cb3b0095c3 + 79112cc3c29f + 987351e1ea7
[C] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/20200709070023.GA18414@lxhi-065.adit-jv.com/
