Agreed.

Hm, don't know sysfs internals either.  It seems possible that someone (or
something...) navigating around could trigger creation unintentionally--for
instance, by reading the symlinks to the memory block dirs in
/sys/devices/system/node/nodeN when trying to find another file to read in the
same place.

Systems that happen to have hotpluggable ranges but don't want the
overhead would still be stuck, though, it seems.


FWIW, the ideas for new_shiny sound promising.
