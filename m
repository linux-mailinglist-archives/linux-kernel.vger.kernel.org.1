Hello

Apologies for my delay. Thanks for the responses!

Yeah, I felt pretty sketchy about this 0% patch as well. But I figured
it's better to send my suggestion and get corrected than lose the
fixed interpolation patch.

Turns out there's no reason to need 2/3. I was mistaken:
echo "4" > /sys/devices/platform/backlight/backlight/backlight/bl_power
seems to work just fine to turn the backlight off, nothing special
about my device (pwm comes from cros_ec).
Chrome OS user space already makes full use of that knob
(https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/master:src/platform2/power_manager/powerd/system/internal_backlight.cc;l=169)
I wanted to try X11 on the same device but I haven't gotten to it yet,
perhaps I'll post my results in the next cover letter.
So it seems I didn't have to worry about "not breaking userspace" on
the existing devices.

I'll respin this patch set: keep 1/3 and 3/3, remove 2/3, and
potentially add another one to update trogdor's dtsi (since that's
where I want this fixed linear interpolation to happen).

Thank you,
Alexandru Stan
