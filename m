Sure, but what's the problem? The adjustemt is done to make the observed
time as correct as possible.

  1) As the frequency of the raw clock is an estimate, resulting time
     is drifting apart vs. the correct frequency.

  2) Depending on the crystal/oszillator there can be temperatur drift as
     well.

Just for clarification. Even with NTP/PTP adjustment the resulting time
stamps are never going to be precise vs. an atomic clock, but good
enough for 99.9999% of the problems.

TBH, I have no idea what real world problem you are trying to solve.

Thanks,
