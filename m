It theoretically matters because pending task work might kill the
task. That's the concern Andy and Peter had. Assume the following:

usermode

 -> exception
    set not fatal signal

    -> exception
        queue task work to kill task
    <- return

  <- return

The same could happen when the non fatal signal is set from a remote CPU.

So in theory that would result in:

   handle non fatal signal first

   handle task work which kills task

which would be the wrong order.

But that's just illusion.

I'm surprised that you can't answer that question yourself. How did you
ever make rseq work and how did rseq_signal_deliver() end up in
setup_rt_frame()?

Hint: Tracing might answer that question

And to cut it short:

    Exit to user space happnes only through ONE channel, i.e. leaving
    prepare_exit_to usermode().

      exit_to_usermode_loop <-prepare_exit_to_usermode
      do_signal <-exit_to_usermode_loop
      get_signal <-do_signal
      setup_sigcontext <-do_signal
      do_syscall_64 <-entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe
      syscall_trace_enter <-do_syscall_64

      sys_rt_sigreturn()
      restore_altstack <-__ia32_sys_rt_sigreturn
      syscall_slow_exit_work <-do_syscall_64
      exit_to_usermode_loop <-do_syscall_64

That's a purely academic problem. The order is completely
irrelevant. You have to handle any order anyway:

usermode

  -> exception / syscall
       sets signal

   <- return

  prepare_exit_to_usemode()
      cached_flags = READ_ONCE(t->flags);
      exit_to_user_mode_loop(regs, cached_flags) {
        while (cached_flags) {
           local_irq_enable();

           handle(cached_flags & RESCHED);
           handle(cached_flags & UPROBE);
           handle(cached_flags & PATCHING);
           handle(cached_flags & SIGNAL);
           handle(cached_flags & NOTIFY_RESUME);
           handle(cached_flags & RETURN_NOTIFY);

           local_irq_disable();
           
           cached_flags = READ_ONCE(t->flags);
         }

cached_flag is a momentary snapshot when attempting to return to user
space.

But after reenabling interrupts any of the relevant flag bits can be set
by an exception/interrupt or from remote. If preemption is enabled the
task can be scheduled out, migrated at any point before disabling
interrupts again. Even after disabling interrupts and before re-reading
cached flags there might be a remote change of flags.

That said, even for the case Andy and Peter were looking at (MCE) the
ordering is completely irrelevant.

I should have thought about this before, so thanks to both of you for
making me look at it again for the very wrong reasons.

Consider the patch dropped.

Thanks,
