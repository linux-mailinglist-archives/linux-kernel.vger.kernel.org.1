Having said that, from time to time there are new features such as, say
LBR callgraph stitching, there are kernel and tooling components, so its
important to try and have the latest perf, but yeah, as you said, one
perf package is enough, just keep it uptodate :-)

For other features such as the metric work with 'perf stat', its purely
userspace, and sometimes its purely kernel space, no lockstep.
