Right, in which case I'm starting to think that we should treat this GPU
SMMU instance specially. Give it its own compatible string (looks like you
need this for HUPCFG anyway) and hook in via arm_smmu_impl_init(). You can
then set IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_ARM_TTBR1 when talking to the io-pgtable code
without having to add a domain attribute.

With that. you'll need to find a way to allow the GPU driver to call into
your own hooks for getting at the TTBR0 tables -- given that you're
programming these in the hardware, I don't think it makes sense to expose
that in the IOMMU API, since most devices won't be able to do anything with
that data. Perhaps you could install a couple of function pointers
(subdomain_alloc/subdomain_free) in the GPU device when you see it appear
from the SMMU driver? Alternatively, you could make an io_pgtable_cfg
available so that the GPU driver can interface with io-pgtable directly.

Yes, it's ugly, but I don't think it's worth trying to abstract this.

Thoughts? It's taken me a long time to figure out what's going on here,
so sorry if it feels like I'm leading you round the houses.
