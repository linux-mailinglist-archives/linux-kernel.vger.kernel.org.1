I'm concerning if applying the switch and making this patch non-default could
reduce the check coverage.  Moreover, IMHO, the deprecation rule of the terms
that described in the 'coding-style.rst' is not so subjective but clear.  Also,
the checkpatch's warning/check message for those seems explicit enough to me.

And, the deprecated terms feature is not for this specific terms
(master/slave/blacklist/whitelist) only but general deprecated terms.  Maybe we
could add one more rule in the 'deprecated_terms.txt' by adding a comment, say,
"Please add only terms that deprecated with clear rules", for avoiding
introduce of subjective deprecated terms in future, though.
