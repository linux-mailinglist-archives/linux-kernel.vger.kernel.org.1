Maybe we can use the same approach as Xen PV-domains: pre-allocate a
region in the memory map to be used for mapping foreign pages. For the
kernel it will look like pre-ballooned memory, so it will create struct
page for the region (which is what we are after), but it won't give the
memory to the allocator.
