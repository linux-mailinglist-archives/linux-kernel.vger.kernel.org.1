That's a much better commit message--thank you, Sean!

I appreciate the feedback; I was trying to capture that Jim "was in
the patch's delivery path."
(per submitting-patches.rst), but it sounds like that is intended for
a more explicit middle-man
relationship than I had understood. Jim reviewed it internally before
sending, which sounds
like it should be expressed as an "Acked-by" instead; is that accurate?

Gotcha, thanks. Yes, when I conferred with Eric on submitting his
commits, he had wanted to
acknowledge that the work was done while he was at Google (e.g. his
old Google email addr),
and  I wanted to include current contact information for him as well.

Your suggestion to combine into a single Signed-off-by is a good one,
and I'll use that form
in the future.

Thanks much,

Jon
