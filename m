As to the patch split suggest, actually, Hugh and I talked about a few weeks 
ago when he give me these changes. We both thought keep these changes in this
patch looks better at that time.
If it make you confuse, don't know a changed commit log make it better?

Thanks

    mm/lru: introduce TestClearPageLRU

    Currently lru_lock still guards both lru list and page's lru bit, that's
    ok. but if we want to use specific lruvec lock on the page, we need to
    pin down the page's lruvec/memcg during locking. Just taking lruvec
    lock first may be undermined by the page's memcg charge/migration. To
    fix this problem, we could take out the page's lru bit clear and use
    it as pin down action to block the memcg changes. That's the reason
    for new atomic func TestClearPageLRU. So now isolating a page need both
    actions: TestClearPageLRU and hold the lru_lock.

    This patch combines PageLRU check and ClearPageLRU into a macro func
    TestClearPageLRU. This function will be used as page isolation
    precondition to prevent other isolations some where else.
    Then there are may non PageLRU page on lru list, need to remove BUG
    checking accordingly.

    There 2 rules for lru bit:
    1, the lru bit still indicate if a page on lru list, just
    in some temporary moment(isolating), the page may have no lru bit when
    it's on lru list.  but the page still must be on lru list when the
    lru bit is set.
    2, have to remove lru bit before delete it from lru list.

    Hugh Dickins pointed that when a page is in freeing path and no one is
    possible to take it, non atomic lru bit clearing is better, like in
    __page_cache_release and release_pages.
    ANd no need get_page() before lru bit clear in isolate_lru_page,
    since it '(1) Must be called with an elevated refcount on the page'.

    As Andrew Morton mentioned this change would dirty cacheline for page
    isn't on LRU. But the lost would be acceptable with Rong Chen
