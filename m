Yep, trace-cmd record -e event -f "pid == $pid"

Maybe not for you, but it does for me. All trace events show what
happened when it happened and who executed it. I like to see what
worker threads are executing. I may filter on the worker thread, and by
changing the ent.pid, I wont see what it is doing.

That said, I think I may add a feature to a trace evnt for a special filter
to say, "test field to the set_event_pid", and if it exists in that
file to include that event in the filtered trace. This would include
sched_waking trace events as well.

That way "trace-cmd record -P $pid" will still work for your case.
