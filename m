No, it wasn't.

I have a fairly good understanding of SGX, and I told you quite
explicitly what was wrong with your changelog.  Understanding the
sentences you wrote and having the background is not at all the same
thing as extracting meaning from your writing.  Your patch conveyed no
information.  This email you just sent also conveys no information.

No, they are not.

The kernel can and will enforce policy on what SGX may do.  Your own
NAKked patch, in fact, does exactly this.  At the same time, SGX
provides security to the contents of enclaves.  These are not mutually
exclusive.

Frankly, the largest problem in the kernel development process with
regards to SGX is the distraction created by your emails.  Please just
stop.

If you have something useful to say, distill it down to the smallest
amount of text that actually says what you're trying to say.  And
don't forget the part about "something useful to say".  If you do not
have something useful to say, please don't say it.
