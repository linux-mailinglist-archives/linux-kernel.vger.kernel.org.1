I think the right thing to do is to fix userspace to respect this
property, since that has the most communal benefit.

However(!!) if you don't want to do that, how about inspecting the
info->panel_orientation value after drm_panel_attach in tegra driver
and then adjusting rotation values in the driver. Of course, you
wouldn't want to expose the panel orientation property since you don't
want userspaces to be double-rotating on you, but it's optional so
you'd be fine.

I don't think this is necessary, but it also wouldn't really be
appropriate to put software attributes into devicetree anyways.
