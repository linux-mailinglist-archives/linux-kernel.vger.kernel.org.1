In CFS case, the misfit task handling in load balancer should help pulling
the BIG task running on the little CPUs. I get your point that we can run
into the same scenario with other scheduling class tasks.

Thanks for the hint. It was not clear to me why 1 msec delay is given for
the small tasks in the rt-app json description in the cover letter.
I get it now :-)
