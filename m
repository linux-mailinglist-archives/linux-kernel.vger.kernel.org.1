I cut some CPU registers' value since it's too long and not relevant.
The Call trace is full.

Most of them is correct. The only difference is CPUx is power on when
cti_enable_hw() is called.  Otherwise it will goto cti_state_unchanged:
and won't call cti_enable_hw_smp_call(). cti_cpu_pm_notify() is called
when CPUx tries to suspend instead of resume.

I'm not sure I understand this correctly.  Let me clarify it a little bit.
It's a deadlock since cti_enable_hw() holds the spinlock and calls
cti_enable_hw_smp_call() from CPUx to enable CTI associated to CPUy. It
waits for cti_enable_hw_smp_call() to return. IPI is sent to CPUy while
CPUy is in cti_cpu_pm_notify() and waits for spinlock. In this patch,
I remove cti_enable_hw_smp_call() and write CTI CPU directly on CPUx.
It won't wait for CPUy and release spinlock after program registers of
CTI. After cti_enable_hw() releases spinlock, cti_cpu_pm_notify() will
continue to run. Since spinlock is held and config->hw_powered is true,
we don't need to worry about CPUy power down when we program CTI on CPUx.

After cti_enable_hw() releases the lock, it's possible that CPU is offline
by user, cti_enable_hw_smp_call() will fail in this case.
