Sounds good.  Overall I'll probably wait to spin until your series
lands because trying to keep spinning this one in conjunction with
that one is going to be a nightmare.  Hopefully that means:

a) Your series can land soon.  I think it's in pretty good shape now.
I just sent a bunch of reviews.  Might need one more spin for nits and
then we'll see if Bjorn thinks it's good to go.

b) Once I spin this it can get a quicker review so other things don't
pop up and change things.

...or, if you want, you can hijack my series and send the next version
out yourself.  I won't object to that but please give me a heads up if
you're planning to do that so we don't duplicate work.

Right.  The race comment still is somewhat interesting because the
only way we're race free is that we know that the sleep/wake values
are only programmed at a time when no more active transactions can be
started.  I'll document that assumption.  If we ever change that
assumption we'll have to think about this more since (at the moment)
programming sleep/wake doesn't set the "tcs_in_use" bit.

As per below I'm trying to understand the motivation for using
check_for_req_inflight() when writing sleep/wake sets, so changing
this is pending on that discussion.

OK.

OK.  I guess I felt like now that check_for_req_inflight() was
documented it was just getting in the way, but I'll keep it if you
want.

Sure, we could use find_match() to add this check.  It definitely
feels a lot better than the current solution which seems to miss a
whole lot of corner cases.

Before I do that, maybe you can help me understand the motivation,
though?  Where are you expecting to find the conflict?  Certainly
there can't be any conflict in the normal (non-batch) sleep/wake sets,
right?  We only have one entry in the RPMH cache per address so the
non-batch entries can't conflict with themselves.  There also can't be
any previous async command still pending because we cache
async/non-async alike.

For batch requests I believe that there's exactly one caller using the
batch API (otherwise rpmh_invalidate() would be a nightmare).  That
one caller is the interconnect code, right?  It feels like we could
assume that the one caller of the batch API won't write to the same
address more than one time?

So I guess you're expecting that an rpmh_write() would write to the
same address that someone wrote to with rpmh_write_batch() and it
should override it?  Does that actually happen?  Isn't the batch API
used just for interconnect stuff and nobody should be using
rpmh_write() to mess with the interconnect stuff?

Sure.  I was trying to do all the documentation in the earlier patches
to provide motivation for and help understand the later patches, but I
can change the order if need be.  It didn't seem a big deal to add the
comments and delete them, but I can understand it being weird.

Right.  I think this was trying to say that the request wasn't
triggered and thus there was no response.  I think it's clearer with
my addition of "but don't trigger." to the comment.
