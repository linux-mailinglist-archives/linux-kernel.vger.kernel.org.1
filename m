And stdu, sthu, etc.  "x" is "indexed form" (reg+reg addressing).

It's most useful in loops (and happens more often there).  You probably
do not have many loops that allow update form insns.

Yeah, I quite understand that.

An unhappy resolution, but it leaves a light on the horizon :-)

In that case, leave the "%Un", if you will but the "<>" back soonish?
Not much point removing it and putting it back later (it is harmless,
there are more instances of it in the kernel as well, since many years).

Thanks!
