I've searched for a function that parses an int from a string and 
stores a pointer to the end; I can find some function simple_strtoul
that matches this criterion, but it's documented as

    "This function has caveats. Please use kstrtoul instead."

... and kstrtoul does not store a pointer to the end. The documentation
of kstrtoul describes simple_strtoul as obsolete as well. Also, there's
no simple_strtou16 function.

It seems that the standard C function strtoul has the behaviour you
describe as well, but this function is not defined in the kernel except
for certain specific architectures.

The function already makes a call to kcalloc, so the unlikely out-of-
memory error path already exists; a second memory allocation just
makes it slightly less unlikely. The two new out-of-memory conditions
do happen at different points of the function though, making them
have different side effects. I could fix this by moving my code.

As for this function being a leaf: keep in mind that this function has
the potential of calling printk in an obscure error condition (the user-
provided parameter being longer that 128 characters); quirks_param_set
calls param_set_copystring, which on its turn calls pr_err, which is a
macro for printk.

Meanwhile, here's a patch for copying the parameter to the stack:
