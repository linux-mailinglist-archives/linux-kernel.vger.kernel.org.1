I can at least speak for RK3328, and the reasoning there was that as the 
user looking at what `aplay -l` says, I don't give a hoot about what the 
SoC may be called, I see two cards and I want to know, with the least 
amount of uncertainty, which one will make the sound come out of the 
port that's labelled "HDMI" on the box ;)
