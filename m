The SBI PMU counters have nothing to do with RISC-V PMU counters because
these are counters provided by SBI implementation.

All-in-all, we have three types of counters:
1. PMU counters defined by RISC-V privilege spec. These are TIME,
INSRET, and CYCLE CSRs.
2. Implementation specific counters accessed via HPMCOUNTER CSRs.
3. SBI PMU counters for traps taken and processed by M-mode runtime
firmware. Examples: number of misaligned load/store, number of illegal
instructions, number of SBI RFENCE calls, number of SBI IPI calls, etc.

The DT based RISC-V PMU platform driver being discussed in this email
thread only addresses points 1) and 2) above.

For point 3) above, we need to first define SBI PMU extension. Once SBI
PMU extension is defined, we can have separate SBI PMU driver in Linux
or extend RISC-V PMU driver to register additonal counters based on
SBI PMU extension.

I never suggested  to access RISC-V HPMCOUNTER CSRs via SBI calls
so DT based RISC-V PMU platform driver (for 1) and 2) above) is good
to have. The SBI PMU extension is a separate topic.

SBI_PMU_COUNTER_START will do that.
