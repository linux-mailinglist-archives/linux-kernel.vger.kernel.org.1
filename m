Subject: [RFC PATCH v7 00/23] Core scheduling v7

Seventh iteration of the Core-Scheduling feature.

(Note that this iteration is a repost of the combined v6 and v6+ series,
and does not include the new interface discussed at LPC).

Core scheduling is a feature that allows only trusted tasks to run
concurrently on cpus sharing compute resources (eg: hyperthreads on a
core). The goal is to mitigate the core-level side-channel attacks
without requiring to disable SMT (which has a significant impact on
performance in some situations). Core scheduling (as of v7) mitigates
user-space to user-space attacks and user to kernel attack when one of
the siblings enters the kernel via interrupts or system call.

By default, the feature doesn't change any of the current scheduler
behavior. The user decides which tasks can run simultaneously on the
same core (for now by having them in the same tagged cgroup). When a tag
is enabled in a cgroup and a task from that cgroup is running on a
hardware thread, the scheduler ensures that only idle or trusted tasks
run on the other sibling(s). Besides security concerns, this feature can
also be beneficial for RT and performance applications where we want to
control how tasks make use of SMT dynamically.

This iteration focuses on the kernel protection when kernel runs along
with untrusted user mode tasks on a core. This was a main gap in the
security aspects provided by core scheduling feature in mitigating the
side-channel attacks. In v6, we had a minimal version where kernel was
protected from untrusted tasks when a sibling enters the kernel via
irq/softirq. System calls were not protected in the v6 patch and the
implementation had corner cases.  With this iteration, user mode tasks
running on siblings in a core are paused until the last sibling exits
kernel and thus guarantees that kernel code does not run concurrently
with untrusted user mode tasks. This protects both syscalls and IRQs vs
usermode and guest. It is also based on Thomas’s x86/entry branch which
moves generic entry code out of arch/

This iteration also fixes the hotplug crash and hang issues present in
v6. In v6, previous hotplug fixes were removed as they were getting
complicated. This iteration addresses the root cause of hot plug issues
and fixes them.

In terms of performance, the active VM-based workloads are still less
impacted by core scheduling than by disabling SMT. There are corner
cases and at this stage, since we are getting closer to merger, we are
actively looking for feedback and reproducers of those so we can address
them.

Performance tests:
sysbench is used to test the performance of the patch series. Used a 8
cpu/4 Core VM and ran 2 sysbench tests in parallel. Each sysbench test
runs 4 tasks:
sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=100000 --num-threads=4 run

Compared the performance results for various combinations as below.
The metric below is 'events per second':

1. Coresched disabled
    sysbench-1/sysbench-2 => 175.7/175.6
2. Coreched enabled, both sysbench tagged
  sysbench-1/sysbench-2 => 168.8/165.6
3. Coresched enabled, sysbench-1 tagged and sysbench-2 untagged
    sysbench-1/sysbench-2 => 96.4/176.9
4. smt off
    sysbench-1/sysbench-2 => 97.9/98.8

When both sysbench-es are tagged, there is a perf drop of ~4%. With a
tagged/untagged case, the tagged one suffers because it always gets
stalled when the sibiling enters kernel. But this is no worse than
smtoff.

Also a modified rcutorture was used to heavily stress the kernel to make
sure there is not crash or instability.

Larger scale performance tests were performed where the host is running
the core scheduling kernel, each VM is in its own tag.

With 3 12-vcpus VMs on a 36 hardware thread NUMA node running linpack
(CPU-intensive), we go from 1:1 to 2:1 vcpus to hardware threads when we
disable SMT, the performance impact of core scheduling is -9.52% whereas
it is -25.41% with nosmt.

With 2 12-vcpus VMs database servers and 192 1-vcpus semi-idle VMs
running on 2 36 hardware threads NUMA nodes (3:1), the performance
impact is -47% with core scheduling and -66% with nosmt.

v7 is rebased on 5.9-rc2(d3ac97072ec5)
https://github.com/digitalocean/linux-coresched/tree/coresched/v7-v5.9-rc

TODO
----
(Mostly same as in v6)
- MAJOR: Core wide vruntime comparison re-work
  https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20200506143506.GH5298@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/
  https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20200514130248.GD2940@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/
- MAJOR: Decide on the interfaces/API for exposing the feature to userland.
  - LPC 2020 gained consensus on a simple task level interface as a starter
  - Investigate ideas on overcoming unified hierarchy limitations with
    cgroup v2 controller
- MAJOR: Load balancing/Migration fixes for core scheduling.
  With v6, Load balancing is partially coresched aware, but has some
  issues w.r.t process/taskgroup weights:
  https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20200225034438.GA617271@ziqianlu-desktop.localdomain/
- Investigate the source of the overhead even when no tasks are tagged:
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/10/29/242
- Core scheduling test framework: kselftests, torture tests etc
