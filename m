This reasoning is correct and IIRC the enforcement of this is just the
way /proc/pressure files are created:

proc_create("pressure/io", 0, NULL, &psi_io_fops);
proc_create("pressure/memory", 0, NULL, &psi_memory_fops);
proc_create("pressure/cpu", 0, NULL, &psi_cpu_fops);

IOW there are no additional capability checks performed on the PSI
trigger users.

For these cases you can provide a userspace privileged daemon that
will relay pressure notifications to its unprivileged clients. This is
what we do on Android - Android Management Server registers its PSI
triggers and then relays low memory notifications to unprivileged
apps.
Another approach is taken by Android Low Memory Killer Daemon (lmkd)
which is an unprivileged process but registers its PSI triggers. The
trick is that the init process executes "chmod 0664
/proc/pressure/memory" from its init script and further restrictions
are enforced by selinux policy granting only LMKD write access to this
file.

Would any of these options work for you?

I didn't consider that as I viewed memory condition tracking that
consumes kernel resources as being potentially exploitable. RT threads
did make that more of an issue but even without them I'm not sure we
should allow unprivileged processes to create unlimited numbers of
triggers each of which is not really free.

Thanks,
