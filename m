Even the Snapdragon hardware that I had tested on contain multiple
onlineable memory blocks. But we have the use case in which we online
single memory block and once it is filled then online the next block. In
the step where single block is onlined, we observed the below pageset
params.
  pagesets
    cpu: 0
              count: 0
              high:  0
              batch: 1
Once the second block is onlined then only seeing some sane values as below.
    cpu: 0
              count: 32
              high:  378
              batch: 63

In the above case, till the second block is onlined, no page is held in
the pcp list. So, updating the pcp params every time when onlining the
memory block is required, as an example in the usecase that I had
mentioned.

Thanks for the ACK.
