Hm yeah I guess that's something we should paper over a bit, but maybe
the bugfix will take care of that.

This actually sounds like a good idea, I had the same one. Doing it
this way should also resolve the WARNING you've pointed out I think?

But I'm still wondering why after step 3 we don't get -EINVAL from
vblank_get() - after vblank_off() vblank->enabled should be false
again, getting us back to the same state as after 1. Is that not
happening?
