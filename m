Hi Viresh,

Thanks for summarising the thoughts quite nicely.

Agreed on both points.

As I mentioned in another thread that non-dvfs requests may be prioritised
lower when there are parallel request to the remote. The so called bad
trace doesn't have such scenario with single channel and all requests
from OS being serialised. The good trace has 2 channels and requests to
remote happen in parallel and hence it is fair to see slightly higher
latencies for lower priority requests.
