Is this the access flag or the dirty flag? On arm64 we distinguish
between the two. Setting the access flag on arm64 doesn't need TLB
flushing since an inaccessible entry is not allowed to be cached in the
TLB. However, setting the dirty bit (clearing read-only on arm64) does
require a TLB flush and ptep_set_access_flags() takes care of this.

It is necessary on arm32/arm64 since pte_mkdirty() clears the read-only
bit.

But do we have guarantee that every time handle_mm_fault() returns
VM_FAULT_RETRY, the pte has already been updated?
