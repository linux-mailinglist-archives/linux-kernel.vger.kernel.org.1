Agree.

I am also interested in whether we can figure out a way to match
consoles and polling drivers. It is better to use the polling
driver rather than the console since the polling drivers "know"
they will execute from all sorts of crazy places. For the most common
use cases this would also result in no console handler ever being
called.

BTW for those asking how this issue an submarine for so long I think
the main factor is that not all architectures implement NMI.

There are exceptions but kdb is typically only useful when either:

1. We have a real (e.g. not USB) serial port, or
2. We have a real (e.g. not USB) keyboard

On x86, where the SMP peers are rounded up using using an NMI, the
above grows increasingly hard to find (although they are certainly
still here). Combined with this very few commonly embedded
architectures round up using an NMI so these problems cannot occur.

This has allowed kdb to fall rather far behind the rest of the kernel
w.r.t. NMI robustness whilst not being entirely useless.

Sumit's recent work to exploit NMIs on arm64 is bringing some of our
debt to the surface... happily I think that will also help us to tackle
it!

Maybe a "Currently" thrown in we switch from general background
information to describing the problem the patch is about to fix helps us
read it:

  Currently the variable "kdb_trap_printk" is checked

But other than that LGTM.
