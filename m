Thinking more about this, there seems to be multiple irqchip drivers
registering softirq API via set_smp_cross_call(). So we need to
introduce a new API instead of replacing set_smp_cross_call() under
"CONFIG_GENERIC_IRQ_IPI" macro until all drivers switch to IPIs as
full interrupts.

BTW, could we take up this generalization as follow-up work as it
seems to be independent of current IPI NMI work?

I have updated the second patch [1] in my tree to incorporate these
changes. The updated commit log is as follows:

commit 25c96663126264ec758c49a4a01a9c285f4ccc61
Author: Sumit Garg <sumit.garg@linaro.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 22 16:29:59 2020 +0530

    irqchip/gic-v3: Setup arch specific IPI as pseudo NMI

    Add support to mark arch specific IPI as pseudo NMI. Currently its used
    to allow arm64 specific IPI_CALL_NMI_FUNC to be marked as pseudo NMI.

    Brief description of changes:
    - Update NMI setup/teardown routines for SGIs.
    - Enable NMI support prior to gic_smp_init().
    - Setup custom flow handler for SGI setup as NMI.
    - Request, prepare and enable arch specific IPI as per CPU NMI using
      common APIs.
