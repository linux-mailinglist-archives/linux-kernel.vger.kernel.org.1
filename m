Just to add my view on this, as we get the same request on the ARM side
once every other year:

- the "broadcast" aspect of the interrupt signalling is usually a waste
   of CPU cycles on all CPUs but the one that has actually takes it.

- the fact that you have to use MMIO to interact with the interrupt
   controller potentially makes this even worse if you don't have some
   per-CPU datapath that will handle this really fast.

- not hitting the same CPU at all times for a given interrupt means that
   the caches are usually cold for this interrupt, meaning the gain in
   latency is pretty dubious.

There is a very small (but also very vocal) fringe of users that insist
that they cannot live without this broadcast aspect, because it allows
them to shave a couple of cycles off a trivial interrupt handler on 
systems
that are otherwise mostly idle.

My answer to this is that Linux is a general purpose OS, and not a
glorified interrupt handler. We aim to have balanced response times, and
give *userspace* control over where the interrupt happens in the long 
run.

HTH,

         M.
