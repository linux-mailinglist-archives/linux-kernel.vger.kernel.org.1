Yes, the comment states that as it is true: you receive a
wild/non-checkable pointer if you do list_entry on an empty list. BUT
have you actually read what I wrote:

No, not only the description, worse, the patch proper looks wrong.

So, the good part in the patch is the fixed locking in
dma_async_device_register. Otherwise it adds nonsense checks. So you
fixed the issue only by a chance, by a side effect as Peter pointed out.
Leaving aside that you broke dma_request_chan -- that could happen to
anybody.

Vinod, please drop/revert this patch. Then start over only with
dma_async_device_register fixed locking.

thanks,
