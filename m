It worries me that you say that this fixes any issues for you.
Specifically I don't see how this could fix anything except:

1. Fix the problem with irqthreads, which is how Stephen originally found this.

2. Fix things to be a little more efficient.

3. Avoid the small handful of messages that show up during normal
usage that look like:

  TCS Busy, retrying RPMH message send: addr=...

I'm guessing you're referring to #3.  Is that correct?

If so, you might want to double-check to confirm that you aren't
totally spamming the RPMh bus with your patch series.  I found that
when I was seeing a lot of "TCS Busy, retrying RPMH message send"
spammed to the console that it was a sign that the code was being
really inefficient.

Specifically the code to add interconnect bandwidth and OPP to the SPI
drivers would run at "runtime_suspend" and "runtime_resume".  For our
SPI drivers this meant that they were running after every single
transfer, and they were quite slow.  If your code is doing similar
then you probably have a problem.

The problem was fixed by adding an autosuspend delay.

References (from linuxnext):

8592eb959ad4 spi: spi-qcom-qspi: Set an autosuspend delay of 250 ms
cfdab2cd85ec spi: spi-geni-qcom: Set an autosuspend delay of 250 ms


Also if your code is adjusting its clock rate too frequently it can
now trigger similar problems.  References:

5f219524ec6e spi: spi-geni-qcom: Set the clock properly at runtime resume
