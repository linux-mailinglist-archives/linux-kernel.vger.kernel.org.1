Definitely I'd be interested to see patches to make SPI work faster.
I'm going to try to characterize how slow things still are and then
will probably try to convince Qualcomm to help since I didn't see lots
of other obvious speedups.  Maybe, as you say, GSI/GPI is magic.

One thing I realized thinking through all this, though.  If we just
naively queue chip select commands without waiting for completion
we'll break Linux's assumptions.  Specifically Linux assumes that when
the SPI driver's set_cs() command returns that the chip select has
actually been set.  If a SPI client drivers sometimes need chip select
to be asserted for a minimum amount of time and so they need to know
that set_cs() actually did its job.  Checkout "struct spi_transfer"
and elements like "delay_usecs".  I know cros_ec uses some of these
fancier features.  See do_cros_ec_pkt_xfer_spi() for reference.

Ah, I guess if the GSI/GPI mode is fancy enough, though, maybe we
could implement one layer higher in the SPI core and provide a
transfer_one_message() instead of transfer_one().  Then we'd be fully
in charge of doing all of the delays ourselves.  So if we could queue
up a "set cs, optional delay, do transfer, optional delay, set cs,
optional delay, ..." then maybe it'd be OK.  I guess if there could be
multiple execution environments using the SPI we'd absolutely need to
implement this anyway since other EEs using the QUP would screw up the
standard timeout calculations.  Even if we did this, though, we still
might have trouble with multiple EEs for some fancier Linux drivers
without more work.  Specifically Linux drivers are allowed to call
spi_bus_lock() and then assume that they have full control of the bus
even across multiple messages.  I guess we'd need some way to make
sure that other EEs aren't running and then lock them out?  We also
would have to figure out how to handle the Linux API which allows you
to mess with lots of SPI parameters (including transfer speed) in the
middle of a message.


So I guess the summary of this is:

- Using GSI mode is a reason to not use GPIOs for chip select assuming
that GSI mode can actually support everything we need and is actually
faster.

- If there are multiple EEs then (mabye?) we can't use GPIOs for chip
select even ignoring GSI mode.  I don't know enough about multiple EEs
and what kind of sharing is supported to know for sure.  Is it
expected that multiple EEs are talking to the same physical peripheral
or are they using the same QUP but w/ a different chip select?  Are
pin mux settings forced to be the same for all EEs?


I guess the question is: are we interested in a short term speedup
while we wait for a better solution?  Maybe the right solution is to
just override this to use GPIOs only on boards known not to support
multiple EEs instead of overriding it in the overall SoC device tree
file?

In all cases I did 3 runs, so providing the average and raw:

# flashrom -p ec -r /tmp/foo.bin

IRQs before: 55796 ((55258 + 55613 + 56519) / 3)
IRQs after: 37512 ((37654 + 36312 + 38571) / 3)

Time before: 11.991 ((12.049 + 11.985 + 11.938) / 3)
Time after: 9.111 ((8.894 + 9.428 + 9.012) / 3)

# time flashrom -p ec -w /tmp/foo.bin

IRQs before: 52568 ((52343 + 52666 + 52696) / 3)
IRQs after: 36507 ((36051 + 35745 + 37727) / 3)

Time before: 13.015 ((12.940 + 13.004 + 13.100) / 3)
Time after: 9.325 ((8.934 + 9.520 +9.522) / 3)


I also gathered a bunch of timings.  Timings at boot are pretty wild
because so many things are happening at once, but it calms down a bit
later on.  Here are two patches I used for timings which also include
some sample timings in their description:

https://crrev.com/c/2267286
https://crrev.com/c/2267290

The quick summary is: even assuming no other overhead at all it takes
about 8 - 9 us just to assert the chip select.  The IRQ overhead isn't
a ton usually (2 - 4 us) but it takes a little while (~10us with lots
of variation) before we start running again on the task that was
waiting.

One thing I did note in the commit message is that I can also get a
speedup (though not as impressive) without configuring the CS to be a
GPIO by just caching the chip select state in the driver and avoiding
setting the chip select when it's already correct.  I still have this
patch, though it doesn't do anything if we switch the CS to GPIO.  I
can still post it if needed.  I stuck it at
<https://crrev.com/c/2267278> for now.  That only gave a 15% speedup,
not 25%.

Hrm.  Is the qcom gpio driver somehow different from other platforms?
I think most code assumes that if it asserts a GPIO that it's
asserted, since it might be doing timing based on setting that GPIO.
I mean there are certainly things like pin rise times and also the
time it takes for the MMIO write to go over the bus, but I don't think
we need to worry about them here.

I agree that GSI doesn't seem like it could be supported when cs-gpios
is present.

I guess I'm not quite as wedded to the immutability of the dts.  While
it's nice to not totally churn the dts and we're supposed to keep in
mind that the dts is supposed to be mostly stable, it doesn't feel
horrible to me to say that if you wanted to enable GSI that you'd have
to change the dts.

How about if we look at it this way: wouldn't it be possible to design
a board where the chip select of the SPI was over on some totally
different GPIO that's not part of a QUP?  The generic SPI bindings
(spi-controller.yaml) explicitly call this out as an OK thing to do,
saying that you could even have some devices using the native
controller chip select and some devices using a GPIO and that's OK.

Assuming we accept that as a valid use case then the SPI driver needs
to be able to work in a non-GSI mode if it's doing a transfer that's
using a GPIO chip select, right?  So if the dts specifies cs-gpios it
will still need to work.


Describing the SPI connection using cs-gpios instead of the native cs
is also not false.  The chip select line _is_ hooked up to a GPIO.
That same line can also be muxed to be the native chip select but that
doesn't make it untrue that it can also be thought of as a GPIO.

I mean, we could also certainly add an entry like this:

  qcom,native-cs-gpio = <...>

...and then we could add a second pinmux config in addition to
"default" called "native-cs-gpio" or something.  Then, if the driver
detected that "native-cs-gpio" (the GPIO and the pinconf) were there
and the driver hadn't yet implemented GSI and the driver knew there
weren't multiple execution environments then it could change the
pinmux and just set the GPIO in its set_cs() function.  That would be
more pristine from a device tree perspective (we're describing
_everything_), but it would also be a heck of a lot more code and
complexity.


Maybe yet another way to think about this whole thing: presumably we
would need firmware changes if we wanted to support sharing a SPI port
across multiple execution environments, right?  The dts describes not
just hardware but also (to some extent) firmware.  When we have
firmware that supports multiple EEs and it's all working then that
would be a good time to change the dts to describe the device+firmware
combo.


So to wrap it all up w/ a bow:

* I can post the SPI change that avoids setting the CS if it was
already right so everyone can get a (smaller) perf boost right away.
Simple and clean.

* We make the change to use cs-gpios just in board-specific device
trees for boards known not to support multiple EEs.  If/when firmware
changes are needed to support multiple EEs we'll update the dts.

* Geni SPI driver should always support both cs-gpios and native cs,
so we don't have to worry about incompatible changes.  Both are valid
ways to describe the device (assuming multiple EEs aren't used).

* If/when we get GSI code we won't be able to use it without changing
away from cs-gpios but cs-gpios should still be functional.

It makes me incredibly disappointed to see fixes like this that
weren't posted upstream.
