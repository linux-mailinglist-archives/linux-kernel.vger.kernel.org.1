Presumably this is using the tis driver?

I think the problem is request_locality ... for some inexplicable
reason a failure there returns -1, which is EPERM to user space.

That seems to be a bug in the async code since everything else gives a
ESPIPE error if tpm_try_get_ops fails ... at least no-one assumes it
gives back a sensible return code.

What I think is happening is that with the patch the TPM goes through a
quick sequence of request, relinquish, request, relinquish and it's the
third request which is failing (likely timing out).  Without the patch,
the patch there's only one request,relinquish cycle because the ops are
held while the async work is executed.  I have a vague recollection
that there is a problem with too many locality request in quick
succession, but I'll defer to Jason, who I think understands the
intricacies of localities better than I do.

If that's the problem, the solution looks simple enough: just move the
ops get down because the priv state is already protected by the buffer
mutex
