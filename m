Ok.  So another Spectre special case.

Glancing at that code, there's a macro which has bl to
.L__pmull_p8_core, which, because it has a local label prefix, doesn't
have an ELF symbol associated with it.  I bet changing that branch to
"bl __pmull_p8_core" (and removing the unnecessary .L__pmull_p8_core
label) would fix the warnings.

So IIUC, this is actually a case where the warning found a cleanup,
albeit a trivial one.

Yeah, like Peter said this sounds like x86 RSB stuffing.  More Spectre
nastiness.

So it sounds like the only valid use case for intra-function calls is
Spectre BS...

So, at the risk of possibly contradicting the past version of myself, my
current feeling is that we should annotate such cases, and then warn on
non-annotated cases like the crypto example above.  There's nothing
normal about these Spectre mitigations, so it's ok to add annotations to
such craziness.
