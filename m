Could you please explain why to ignore these events instead of sending
them to userspace via input layer? I think that userspace can be
interested in knowing when Fn lock key was pressed and I can imagine
that some it can use it for some purposes.

These messages are printed to inform about fact that some events were
not processed. And they should not be silenced without reason. If for
some reasons it is needed to completely ignore some kind of events then
this reason should be documented (e.g. in commit message) so other
developers would know why that code is there. Not all Linux developers
have all those Dell machines for testing so they do not know all
hardware details.

It is really sequence of events? Because you wrote that Fn-lock key was
pressed (and not generic event). Also it is really sequence? And not
just one event/key-press (with possibility of some additional details in
buffer)? It would be nice to put documentation for this type of events
to check and review that implementation is correct.
