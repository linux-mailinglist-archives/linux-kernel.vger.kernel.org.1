I'm not sure I get it.

In the guest, /dev/vsock is only used to get the CID assigned to the
guest through an ioctl().

In the virtio-vsock case, the guest transport is loaded when it is discovered
on the PCI bus, so we need a way to "move" it to a netns or to specify
which netns should be used when it is probed.

Thanks for that!
An idea that I had, was to add a new ioctl to /dev/vhost-vsock to enable
the netns support, but I'm not sure it is a clean approach.
