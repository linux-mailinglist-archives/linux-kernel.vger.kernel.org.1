Yes, I believe that there is a configuration to cap the maximum number
of workers. This is not my area but my understanding is that the maximum
is tuned based on available memory and/or cpus. We have been hit byt
this quite heavily on SLES. Maybe newer version of systemd have a better
tuning.

But, it seems that udev is just a messenger here. There is nothing
really fundamentally udev specific in the underlying problem unless I
miss something. It is quite possible that this could be triggered by
other userspace which happens to fire many workers at the same time and
condending on a shared page.

Not that I like this workaround in the first place but it seems that the
existing code allows very long wait chains and !PREEMPT kernels simply
do not have any scheduling point for a long time potentially. I believe
we should focus on that even if the systemd as the current trigger can
be tuned better. I do not insist on this patch, hence RFC, but I am
simply not seeing a much better, yet not convoluted, solution.
