We have devices deployed where these crashes are seen consistently,
so for some immediate relief, could we atleast get some fix in this
cycle without major design overhaul which would likely take more time.
Perhaps my first patch [1] without any check for owner or
I can post a new version as Suzuki suggested [2] dropping the export
of is_kernel_event(). Then we can always work on top of it based on the
conclusion of this discussion, we will atleast not have the systems
crash in the meantime, thoughts?
