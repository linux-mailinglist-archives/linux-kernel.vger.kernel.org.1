Below I will be referring to the Intel Trusted Execution Technology
(Intel TXT), Software Development Guide, December 2019, Revision 016.
So, the latest and greatest...

I think that this part requires more discussion. In my opinion we should
have this region dynamically allocated because it gives us more flexibility.
Of course there is a question about the size of this buffer too. I am
not sure about that because I have not checked yet how many log entries
are created by the SINIT ACM. Though probably it should not be large...

Appendix F, TPM Event Log, has following sentence: There are no
requirements for event log to be in DMA protected memory – SINIT will
not enforce it.

I was thinking about it and it seems to me that the TPM event log does
not require any special protections. Any changes in it can be quickly
detected by comparing hashes with the TPM PCRs. Does not it?

The TXT spec has the following pseudocode:

  //
  // Intel TXT detection
  // Execute on all logical processors for compatibility with
  // multiple processor systems
  //
  1. CPUID(EAX=1);
  2. IF (SMX not supported) OR (VMX not supported) {
  3. Fail measured environment startup;
  4. }

However, a few lines above you can find this:

  Lines 1 - 4: Before attempting to launch the measured environment, the
  system software should check that all logical processors support VMX and
  SMX (the check for VMX support is not necessary if the environment to be
  launched will not use VMX).

Hence, AIUI, I am allowed to check SMX only. And I do not think that the
bootloader should enforce VMX. If the kernel wants VMX then it should
check the platform config. The booloader should just look for features
which are really required to properly execute GETSEC[SENTER].

The TPM presence is checked in init_txt_heap(). However, we can do it earlier.

grub_txt_verify_platform() checks TXT_RESET.STS bit and fails if it is
set. This produces an error during boot. Well, but it does not prevent
it... :-( Probably I have to fix it...

I think that we should add e.g. slaunch_lcp command and do not overload
slaunch_module command. However, I am not planning support for it in the
near feature. I mean I will not be working on it...

Sure, will take that into account.

Thank you for your comments,

Daniel

PS By the way, I found an issue in TXT spec. TXT.VER.FSBIF refers to
   TXT.VER.EMIF which does not exist in spec. I suppose that it is
   remnant from previous TXT spec versions. It seems to me that it
   should be changed to TXT.VER.QPIIF. TXT.VER.QPIIF descriptions
   properly, IMO, refers back to TXT.VER.FSBIF.
