OK - sorry I read your statement saying that replicator1 was 0 after
the reset in probe(), rather than look at the logs.

From the logs it is working at the time probe() occurs, but by the
time we come to enable the replicator later, something has reset these
registers / hardware outside the control of the replicator driver.

Hardlockup is not expected, but this is not related to any possible
backpressure.

Ordinarily having both legs of a replicator enabled should not cause
system failure.
