Ok. For dracut, the process for building the unified kernel image needs
a check to make sure the kernel can fit in the space provided for it --
there is 16MiB of space and the distro bzImage's are up to 10-11MiB in
size, so there's some slack left at present.

Additionally, in mixed-mode, the unified kernel images are quite likely
to end up with early pgtables from startup_32 clobbering the initrd,
independently of the recent kernel changes. Hopefully no-one actually
uses these in mixed-mode.
