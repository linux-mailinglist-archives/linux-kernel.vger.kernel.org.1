Unclear.

Mainline linux-5.6 should boot on that machine but might not have
all the other features, so I think users tend to use the raspberry pi
kernel sources for now.

The reproducer is very simple without threads or signals,
see the start of https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make/issues/96

It does rely on calling into the musl wrapper, not the direct vdso
call.

I hope we can figure out what is actually going on soon, there is probably
no need to change glibc before we have.
