Yes, went for a minimal patch here to stop kernel panics, didn't try to
refactor. Note that we do hold chip->ops_sem in both cases, and it's a
write-lock, not a read-lock (as tpm_try_get_ops uses) since we are
changing chip->ops. Thanks to this write-lock there, shouldn't be parallel
operations that use chip->ops (so not locking chip->tpm_mutex shouldn't
affect it).

So, if I understand the idea right, can refactor to something like:
1) extract common code between tpm_del_char_device and
tpm_class_shutdown into a shared method;
2) further extract the part between up/down(chip->ops_sem) to be
re-used between tpm_try_get_ops/tpm_put_ops and this flow;
3) still have down_write/up_write in this flow vs
get/put_device + down_read/up_read in tpm_try_get_ops case.

Please let me know if that's a bad idea.

Will be unavailable next week, but will continue after that.
