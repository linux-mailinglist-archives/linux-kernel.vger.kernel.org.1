It's a little gross, but it's OK with me.  I guess the other option
would be to have "kgdboc_earlycon" try again at various different
initcall levels...

Speaking of which, I wonder if you could just make kgdboc register to
run at "console_initcall" level.  If I'm reading it properly:

start_kernel()
- setup_arch(): ACPI stuff is done by the end of this, right?
- console_init(): It would be easy to get called here, I think.
- dbg_late_init(): Where you're hooking in now.

I didn't put printouts in any code and test it out, but if the above
is right then you'll actually get called _earlier_ and with less
hackiness if you just have kgdboc try again at console initlevel.

Personally I'd rather take all the caveats out and just make it
generic.  Stash the name of the console in a string (you can make it
initdata so it doesn't waste any space) and just always retry later if
we didn't find the console.  Then you don't need to be quite so
fragile and if someone else finds another reason to delay earlycon
we'll still work.

Speaking of which, if we build kgdboc as a module won't you get an
error accessing "earlycon_acpi_spcr_enable"?

It's not required to add "__init" for declarations, is it?

I assume the above is because "kgdboc" can be compiled as a module and
you need to essentially no-op your call in that case?  If so, could
you add a comment about it?  I also would have thought you'd actually
need to define the weak function implementation, not just declare it.
Maybe I'm confused, though.

It feels like it'd be better not to make yourself an "else" but rather
to add a 2nd "if" test either at the beginning or the end of this
function.  I'm 99% sure it makes no difference, but it makes my brain
hurt a little trying to prove it because you've added another flow of
control to analyze / keep working.  Specifically you've now got a case
where you're running a bunch of the "debug_core" code where
"dbg_is_early = false" but you haven't yet run "KDB_INIT_FULL".

Anyway, I don't feel that strongly about it, so if you really like it
the way it is that's fine...
