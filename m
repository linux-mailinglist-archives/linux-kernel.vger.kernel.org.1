FWIW I don't think you actually need to adjust the count here - the SMR 
being valid should already prevent the whole SME from being reassigned 
until the display probes, at which point it should "take over" the SMR 
based on matching values and claim the "initial" refcount. After that 
you're back into the standard flow. It might be a little unintuitive to 
have something in a valid but "unused" state, but arguably it's entirely 
accurate in terms of the software abstraction here.

Otherwise, you end up making boot-time SMRs - so potentially all SMRs 
after a kexec - effectively immutable, since even after Linux has taken 
control of the whole system such that they *could* be reassigned safely, 
there's still this undroppable refcount hanging around preventing it.

That said, for a mobile SoC use-case if you have enough SMRs for all 
your stream IDs and don't have any kind of device hotplug, that 
restriction shouldn't make much difference in practice, so I'm not too 
concerned either way. Otherwise this is as nice and tidy as I'd hoped :)
