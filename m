Sorry I guess I wasn't clear.

We use _either_ pselect(), _or_ the close()-the-dup trick.  Not both.

If we have pselect() we use that: no dup'ing or close'ing needed.

If we don't have pselect() we use the close() in the signal handler. 
In that case we're just waiting in the read(), we're not using select()
or poll() or whatever.  It's definitely the case that if we're waiting
in read() and someone closes the FD, we'll wake up! :)

Right, my first idea has this same problem so it won't work.

Again, that only works on systems where pselect() is available.

Something like that would be needed, yes.

Note this is only needed in a rare situation where you're running with
parallelism enabled BUT you have a makefile which never actually tries
to run two or more jobs at the same time for some reason.
