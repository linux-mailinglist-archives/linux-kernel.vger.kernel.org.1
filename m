I don't really have anything against using kzalloc() there; but in my
opinion that's not a fix, that's hardening. The real problem, in my
opinion, is that regset->get() claims to have filled out a buffer
without actually having done so; and if someone happens to add another
caller to that thing in the future, I don't want them to run into
exactly the same problem again.
