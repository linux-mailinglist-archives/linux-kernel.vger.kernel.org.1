Yours observation is correct, all the drivers *do the lookup*. My point
is that the nvidia,memory-controller usage isn't strictly necessary.

The tegra20-devfreq driver doesn't use the phandle lookup because
Tegra20 DTs don't have it, instead it uses the compatible lookup. Hence
this patch doesn't really change the already existing behaviour for the
drivers. The phandle usage is optional.

This patch adds a common API that is usable by *all* the already
existing drivers, starting from the Tegra20 drivers.

As I already said in the other reply, it should be fine to add lookup by
the phandle and then fall back to the compatible matching. On the other
hand, this is not strictly necessary because we always have only a
single MC device at a time.

Please note that I don't have any objections to improving this patch. In
the end either way will work, so we just need to choose the best option.
I was merely explaining the rationale behind this patch and not trying
to defend it.

Yours suggestion about using static mc variable is also good to me since
currently MC driver is built-in and at least that won't be a
globally-visible kernel variable, which doesn't feel great to have.

I think we can follow approach of the static mc variable for the starter
and improve it once there will be a real need. This should be the
simplest option right now.

But again, we may slightly future-proof the API by adding the
resource-managed variant. Either way will be good, IMO :) Currently I
don't have a strong preference.
