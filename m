Unfortunately acpi_dev_get_resources is not defined when compiling with
CONFIG_ACPI disabled, therefore #ifdef seems to be the only choice.

No problem, will update this.

Agreed, looks better.

If kempld_pdev is not defined, this means no platform device has been
created using the DMI id table and we are currently probing the ACPI
based platform device.
Will add a comment to the code.

kempld_pdev is the DMI based platform device created in kempld_init
(through force_device_id or dmi_check_system). pdev is the one passed
by the probe function. (kempdl_pdev != pdev) means pdev is the device
created using the ACPI table. As there is only one physical device and
the DMI based version should have priority, the probe is aborted at
this point. As it is not an error condition, only a notice is created
to indicate that ACPI is not used for probing the device.

To my understanding, with synchronous probing it should. According to
the definition of the probe_type enum this is still the default for all
drivers.
I guess it would make sense to enforce this for the case the default is
changed in the future.
Added this to v2:
	.probe_type = PROBE_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS,

Only exception, to my knowledge, is if drivers_autoprobe is disabled
for platform drivers during kempld_init. As DMI has priority, the
driver will later only allow to manually bind the DMI platform device,
if ACPI and DMI are both supported on a platform.

At this point it is checked if the kempld_pdev has been already created
(force_device_id parameter) and if the ACPI based probe has been
already successfull. If not, the DMI table is searched for a matching
device ID. Doing this at this point should prevent unnecessarily
checking the DMI table.

While writing the above comments I noticed that unregistering the
driver at this point prevents manually binding the driver to a device
if drivers_autoprobe is set to 0. This only made sense as long as DMI
based detection was the only method supported. Therefore I removed it
in v2.
