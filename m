The Glorious software is merely used to map the actions to the buttons.
The mouse comes with a common default configuration (forward and back on
the side buttons) but every button can be remapped to any action. I am
used to having a Play/Pause button on my mouse and that's where I
encountered the problem in the first place.

The configuration of the mouse is then stored in the firmware. The
Glorious software is not required to be running or even to be installed
for the mouse to function. The vanilla Windows HID driver is in use.
Sorry if that wasn't clear.

It unfortunately appears to be the case. Just for reference, here is the
relevant part of the original descriptor again:
  
  INPUT(2)[INPUT]
    Field(0)
      Flags( Constant Variable Absolute )
    Field(1)
      Flags( Constant Variable Absolute )
    Field(2)
      Flags( Constant Variable Absolute )

Windows accepts the reports just fine. Unless there is something else at
play here, but I don't see anything that could be since the default HID
driver is used on Windows.

I also set the Relative flag instead of Absolute in the driver, in order
to drop repeat events when holding down the button. These are not
desirable in the case of consumer control events, such as 'Next Track'.
This is not a big problem, though.

Regards,
Samuel
