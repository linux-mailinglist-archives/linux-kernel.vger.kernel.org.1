.... and I spoke too soon.  A number of runs using -rc6 are now
failing even with the n1-standard-2 VM, so virtio-ballon may not be an
indicator.

This is why debugging this is frustrating; it is very much a heisenbug
--- although 5.8 seems to work completely reliably, as does commits
before 37f4a24c2469.  Anything after that point will show random
failures.  :-(
