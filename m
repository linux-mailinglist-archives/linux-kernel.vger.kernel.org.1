Yes, I would expect the TCO bit is the best option for wrapping accesses 
to make them unchecked.

Yes as things stand LDG/STG is the way for user space to access tags. 
Since I don't have any real hardware I can't really comment on speed.

It is a shame, however I suspect this is because to use those 
instructions you need to know the block size held in GMID_EL1. And at 
least in theory that could vary between CPUs.

When we have some real hardware it would be worth profiling this. At the 
moment I've no idea whether the kernel entry overhead would make such an 
interface useful from a performance perspective or not.
