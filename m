Sorry, I didn't explain clearly.

You know the idea is to copy evsel->prev_raw_counts to evsel->counts before 
reporting the summary.

But for AGGR_GLOBAL (cpu = -1 in perf_evsel__compute_deltas), the 
evsel->prev_raw_counts is only stored with the aggr value.

if (cpu == -1) {
	tmp = evsel->prev_raw_counts->aggr;
	evsel->prev_raw_counts->aggr = *count;
} else {
	tmp = *perf_counts(evsel->prev_raw_counts, cpu, thread);
	*perf_counts(evsel->prev_raw_counts, cpu, thread) = *count;
}

So after copying evsel->prev_raw_counts to evsel->counts, 
perf_counts(evsel->counts, cpu, thread) are all 0.

Once we go to process_counter_maps again, in process_counter_values, count->val 
is 0.

case AGGR_GLOBAL:
	aggr->val += count->val;
	aggr->ena += count->ena;
	aggr->run += count->run;

And the aggr->val is 0.

So this patch uses a trick that saves the previous aggr value to cpu0/thread0, 
then above aggr->val calculation can work correctly.

Thanks
Jin Yao
