Thanks, greatly appreciated.

Xen seems to already contain skeleton
XEN_EFI_query_capsule_capabilities and XEN_EFI_update_capsule
hypercalls which is what should be used in order to perform the
updates?

So yes, I agree Xen should make sure the region of the table is not
freed when exiting boot services, and that dom0 can access it. I
guess we should move the checks done by Linux to Xen, and then only
provide the ESRT table to dom0 if the checks (now done by Xen) pass.

It might be helpful to see the whole picture here with the hooks to
perform the updates also implemented, as those are missing in Xen (and
Linux?). That would give a clearer view of what you are trying to
achieve IMO.

Thanks, Roger.
