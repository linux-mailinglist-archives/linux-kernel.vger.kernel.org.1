Changes from Previous Version
=============================

- Add missed 'put_page()' calls
- Support unmapped LRU pages

Introduction
============

NOTE: This is only an RFC for future features of DAMON patchset[1], which is
not merged in the mainline yet.  The aim of this RFC is to show how DAMON would
be expanded once it is merged in.  So, if you have some interest in this RFC,
please consider reviewing DAMON, either.

DAMON[1] programming interface users can extend DAMON for any address space by
configuring the address-space specific low level primitives with appropriate
ones including their own implementations.  However, because the implementation
for the virtual address space is only available now, the users should implement
their own for other address spaces.  Worse yet, the user space users who rely
on the debugfs interface and user space tool, cannot implement their own.

This patchset implements another reference implementation of the low level
primitives for the physical memory address space.  With this change, hence, the
kernel space users can monitor both the virtual and the physical address spaces
by simply changing the configuration in the runtime.  Further, this patchset
links the implementation to the debugfs interface and the user space tool for
the user space users.

Note that the implementation supports only the user memory, as same to the idle
page tracking feature.

Baseline and Complete Git Trees
===============================

The patches are based on the v5.8 plus DAMON v20 patchset[1] and DAMOS RFC v14
patchset[2].  You can also clone the complete git tree:

    $ git clone git://github.com/sjp38/linux -b cdamon/rfc/v8

Sequence of Patches
===================

The sequence of patches is as follow.

The first 5 patches allow the user space users manually set the monitoring
regions.  The 1st and 2nd patches implements the features in the debugfs
interface and the user space tool, respectively.  Following two patches update
unittests (the 3rd patch) and selftests (the 4th patch) for the new feature.
Finally, the 5th patch documents this new feature.

Following 5 patches implement the physical memory monitoring.  The 6th patch
implements the low level primitives.  The 7th and the 8th patches links the
primitives to the debugfs and the user space tool, respectively.  The 9th patch
further implement a handy NUMA specific memory monitoring feature on the user
space tool.  Finally, the 10th patch documents this new features.
