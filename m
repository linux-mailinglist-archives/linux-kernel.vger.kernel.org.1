Please wrap your lines correctly...

Anyway, there is no config option for that function that you can trigger
off of?

Really?  I would just drop it.  Unless you get a signed-off-by from a
lawyer saying it is required :)

That's fine, but we can't take a 1 sentance help text, that means
nothing.

> The driver is mostly GPLv2-only, but a subset constitutes a "hardware access library" that is almost completely OS-independent. "almost" because it has calls to non-GPL symbols like kmalloc() and kfree(). This dual-licensed portion can be ported to other environments that need the more permissive BSD license.

Then put that "OS independant" part as a separate file, with a separate
license.  You all know how to do this properly, don't mix this stuff up.

But even then, I would drop such a library as that's not going to make a
good Linux driver, we do not like, or need, such things in the kernel.

Wonderful, when will that happen?
