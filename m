Thanks for the test results and the turbo stats figures.
The outcomes are not as obvious as I would have expected. The
performance difference for v5.5 and v5.7 when C6 and above are
disabled tends to confirm that the idle state is impacting the
performance but the difference still remain.
Regarding turbostat output, the 1st main difference is the number of
time the CPUs entered idle state:
v5.4 run1 : 587252+905317+367732+859828+108+332436+110+217=3053000
v5.7 run1 : 807623+639635+466723+1298557+108+283548+63+156=3496413
which is +14% of entering idle.
This is even more obvious on v5.5 run1:
761950+1320362+1681750+682042+91+304755+79+243=4751272 which is +55%
of entering idle

We have a similar ratio without c6 and above c-state between v5.4 and
v5.7 and the ratio has decreased to +22% between v5.4 and v5.5.

So this tends to confirm my assumption that tasks are more spread and
this generates more enter/leave cpuidle. I still need to think about
how to balance this
