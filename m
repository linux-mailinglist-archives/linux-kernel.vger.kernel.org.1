I'd prefer something slightly more standard for the separator, like '/',
which is what we usually use when we want to represent a path in a tree.
I do agree on the general approach though.

Note that controller name is normally hidden in the root MTD device
name, and it's the driver responsibility to come up with a name that
does not collide with other MTD drivers. We can of course try to pick a
different name if we see another device with the same name, but we
should definitely warn about that so drivers are patched accordingly.
