Seems like you have not changed the commit message from the last time.
This does not explain the problem as we had discussed before. This just
states the effects of the problem not the cause which is really required
when there is a proposal for change in behavior.

Before and after the patch behavior should be described after the problem
and it's solution have been articulated.

As mentioned before, there is nothing arm64 specific here. The problem just
manifests on arm64 platform because of it's memory init process.

Function call sequence should be described (if at all) cleanly with proper
indentation.

The commit message here is not proper for the change it's proposing. It needs
to describe the problem, how it manifests on arm64 but remains hidden on x86,
proposed solution i.e changes in generic and platform code, also if required
before and after patch behavior on arm64 which had triggered this patch. Also
please take care of the indentation, paragraph formatting and avoid writing
in first person singular format.

The in-code documentation should be where it is defined i.s mm/hugetlb.c and
also in existing format e.g see unmap_kernel_range_noflush() in mm/vmalloc.c
