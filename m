s/encrypted/protected/

s/(or even a whole page containing it is corrupted)/can not be
	read and the read error kills the hypervizor with a SIGSEGV/


As an aside, we could maybe handle that more gracefully
on the hypervisor side.

Not neessarily, it could also be fully transparent. See e.g.
recent AMD andvances allowing unmodified guests with SEV.

Well that depends on where does the warning go. If it's on a serial port
it might be reported host side before the crash triggers.  But
interesting point generally. How about a feature to send a warning code
or string to host then?
