For the purpose of this discussion, ignore the enclave permissions.  The only
reason they're mentioned is to explain the background (well, try to) of how we
ended up at an ->mprotect() hook.  There was a great deal of discussion in the
past about whether or not we could use enclave permissions to enforce OS
permissions.  The TL:DR version is that because of ENCLU[EMODPE], the answer
is "no".

What we're preventing via ->mprotect() is using SGX to bypass existing
restrictions on code execution, e.g. noexec and LSM policies.

Because code must first be loaded into an enclave before it can be executed,
all enclaves are kind of a variant on (in SELinux terminology) either EXECMOD
or EXECMEM.  I.e. it's simply not possible to execute an enclave by mapping
the source file as executable.  This effectively allows userspace to bypass a
noexec FS by loading code into an enclave without EXEC perms on the source
file, only on /dev/sgx/enclave, and denying EXEC on /dev/sgx/enclave would
prevent running _any_ enclave.

The ->mprotect() hook is used by SGX to require userspace to declare what
permissions are allowed on any given enclave page, e.g. SGX's mmap()/mprotect()
requires all underlying enclave pages to be declared as executable if the
mmap()/mprotect() is specifying VM_EXEC.  By requiring userspace to declare
their intent up front, SGX can then enforce noexec by requiring pages that are
declared as executable to have VM_MAYEXEC set in the source VMA when loading
code into the enclave.

As Jarkko pointed out, an alternative to adding ->mprotect() would be to
simply require VM_MAYEXEC on _all_ source VMAs when loading code into the
enclave.  That would work, albeit with the potentially undesirable side effect
of preventing loading any part of an enclave from e.g. a noexec, readonly FS.

But, unconditionally requiring VM_MAYEXEC doesn't address the Linux Security
Module hooks for mmap() and mprotect(), which could also be bypassed by abusing
SGX.  E.g. a process could gain arbitrary code execution by loading code from
anonymous memory into an enclave, as the LSM checks hooks at mmap()/mprotect()
will see always vm_file=/dev/sgx/enclave.  An LSM could deny a process access
to /dev/sgx/enclave, but again that is very coarse granularity.

By requiring userspace to declare permissions up front (when loading code/data
into an enclave), SGX can make explicit upcalls to LSMs hooks at load time so
that an LSM can enforce a meaningful policy, e.g. require all enclave code to
originate from an executable file system.  This series doesn't actually
implement the LSM integration, but it does ensure that _if_ we want to add LSM
support in the future, we can do so without breaking userspace.
