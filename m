To give more context, we are actually targeting the clients/consumers
of SMMU/IOMMU here because we have to make sure that before the supplier
(SMMU) shuts down, its consumers/clients need to be shutdown properly.
Now the ordering of this is taken care in the SMMU driver via 
device_link
which makes sure that consumer shutdown callbacks are called first, but 
we
need to define shutdown callbacks for all its consumers to make sure we
actually shutdown the clients or else it would invite the crashes during 
reboot
which in this case was seen for display.

Thanks,
Sai
