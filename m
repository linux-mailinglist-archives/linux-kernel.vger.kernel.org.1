That thread, nor your explanation make any sense -- why do we care about
softirqs?, nor do I see how placing it in finish_task_switch() helps
with any of this.

If you were to do a queue_balance_callback() from somewhere in the
pick_next_task() machinery, then the balance_callback() at the end of
__schedule() would run it, and it'd be gone. How would
rt_mutex_setprio() / __sched_setscheduler() be affected?
