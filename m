1) does this replicator part have a unique ID that differs from the
standard ARM designed replicators?
If so perhaps link the modification into this. (even if the part no in
PIDR0/1 is the same the UCI should be different for a different
implementation)

2) We have used DT properties in the past - (e.g. scatter gather in
TMC) where hardware compatibility issues have impacted on the
operation of a coresight component. This is further complicated by the
fact that an ACPI property would be needed as well.

3) The sysfs access to FILTERID0/1 on this replicator is going to show
different values than on a standard replicator (0x00 instead of 0xFF).
Does this need to be addressed?

4 ) An alternative approach could be to model the driver on the ETM /
CTI drivers where the register values are held in the driver structure
and only applied on enable / disable.

Thoughts?

Regards

Mike
