Right, good observation.  My patch makes it better, but it's still broken.

I don't know how to fix it.  If we see i_nlink == 1 and multiple hashed
dentries, there doesn't appear to be a way to distingush which one corresponds
to the remaining link on-disk (if any; it may not even be in the dcache), and
which correspond to links that vfs_unlink() has deleted from disk but hasn't yet
done d_delete() on.

One idea would be choose one, then take inode_lock_shared(dir) and do
__f2fs_find_entry() to check if the dentry is really still on-disk.  That's
heavyweight and error-prone though, and the locking could cause problems.

I'm wondering though, does f2fs really need try_to_fix_pino() at all, and did it
ever really work?  It never actually updates the f2fs_inode::i_name to match the
new directory.  So independently of this bug with deleted links, I don't see how
it can possibly work as intended.
