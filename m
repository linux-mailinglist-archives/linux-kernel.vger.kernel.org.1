Thanks for your explanation. It will be helpful to add these comments 
for the code in case someone else wants to do the same thing like this 
patch in future. I can send a patch to add these comments if you have no 
objection.

OK. Sounds it is worth sending a patch to initialize this structure 
explicitly to keep consistent.
