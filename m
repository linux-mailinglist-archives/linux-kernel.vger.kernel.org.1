Would you be happy with:

	/*
	 * For ABI reasons, PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_ABI_32 is messy.
	 *
	 * 32-bit consumers of the regs expect this to look like the
	 * native 32-bit layout with entries 0-12 being r0-r12, 13 being
	 * the SP, 14 being the LR, and 15 being the PC. The compat SP
	 * and LR are placed in x13 and x14 respectively upon an
	 * exception, but we need to copy the PC into the expected slot.
	 * Ideally the other slots would all be zeroed to match native
	 * 32-bit, but we can't do this because of existing 64-bit
	 * consumers.
	 *
	 * Existing 64-bit consumers assume that the PC, LR, and SP are
	 * in the same positions as the PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_ABI_64 layout,
	 * rather than interpreting PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_ABI_32 the same as
	 * the native 32-bit PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_ABI_32. To not break these
	 * we must copy the PC into their ABI_64 slots, and leave copies
	 * of the SP and LR in their ABI_64 slots.
	 *
	 * At the time we make a sample, we don't know what the consumer
	 * is, so we have to apply bodges both ways to avoid breaking
	 * some binaries.
