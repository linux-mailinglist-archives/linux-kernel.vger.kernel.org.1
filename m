That in itself doesn't seem entirely unreasonable; IIRC the current 
address is just an arbitrary choice to fit nicely into Qemu's memory 
map, and there was always the possibility that it wouldn't suit everything.

That, however, doesn't seem to fit here; iommu-dma maps MSI doorbells 
dynamically, so they aren't affected by reserved regions any more than 
regular DMA pages are. In fact, it explicitly ignores the software MSI 
region, since as the comment says, it *is* the software that manages those.

The MSI_IOVA_BASE region exists for VFIO, precisely because in that case 
the kernel *doesn't* control the address space, but still needs some way 
to steal a bit of it for MSIs that the guest doesn't necessarily know 
about, and give userspace a fighting chance of knowing what it's taken. 
I think at the time we discussed the idea of adding something to the 
VFIO uapi such that userspace could move this around if it wanted or 
needed to, but decided we could live without that initially. Perhaps now 
the time has come?
