Use of KERN_DEBUG affects userspace syslog daemon. We will have to ask administrators
to configure syslog daemon not to filter KERN_DEBUG messages. And administrators will
be bothered by needless KERN_DEBUG messages. Also,

we will have to ask people to "don't make pr_debug() no-op" or
"use KERN_DEBUG instead of pr_debug()".

Your suggestion to change KERN_$LOGLEVEL keeps bothering people. That's bad.

Right. KERN_NO_CONSOLES is a modifier.

KERN_NO_CONSOLES can not cause pains like LOGLEVEL_SCHED because
KERN_NO_CONSOLES is to say "no need to call console drivers" while
LOGLEVEL_SCHED is to say "don't call console drivers now but have
to call console drivers later".

Right.

Wrong. Console loglevel is already hiding some messages.

That's part of deciding what messages are important for him, as well as
deciding what KERN_$LOGLEVEL messages are worth printing to consoles.
