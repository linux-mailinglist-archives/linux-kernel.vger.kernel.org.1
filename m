Subject: [PATCH V6 0/4] Add wakeup support over UART RX
Date:   Mon, 14 Sep 2020 19:28:33 +0530

Changes in V2:
 - As per Matthias's comment added wakeup support for all the UARTs
   of SC7180.
 - Added sleep state in sc7180-idp.dts file.
 - Modify the if check in set_mctrl API in serial driver to avoid
   making RFR high during suspend.

Changes in V3:
 - As per Matthias's comments modify the idp dts pin config to keep
   only the required pin settings.
 - Remove the extra parentheses from serial driver patch.

Changes in V4:
 - As per Matthias's comments, change the commit text to mention why
   GPIO function needs to be selected in sleep.
 - Add separate patch for improvements made in pin conf settings.

Changes in V5:
 - Moved pinctrl and interrupt configuration to board specific files.
 - Added new patch for trogdor board specific changes.

Changes in V6:
 - As per Doug's comments, fixed nits in patch 2 and 3.
 - As per Bjorn's comments changed the commit text and rationale for
   rts, tx and rx in patch 2 and 3.
