Jon,

I actually tried a patch close to yours before the patch I actually sent
upstream.

On my previous version, I was doing:

======================== =======================================================
...
test_dummy_encryption
test_dummy_encryption=%s Enable dummy encryption, which provides a fake fscrypt
			 context. The fake fscrypt context is used by xfstests.
			 The argument may be either "v1" or "v2", in order to
			 select the corresponding fscrypt policy version.
...
======================== =======================================================

The problem with the above is that Sphinx understood the first line as one row,
and the second one as a different one. So, the HTML output would be like:

<table>
...
<tr><td>test_dummy_encryption</td></tr>
<tr><td>test_dummy_encryption=%s</td>
<td>Enable dummy encryption, which provides a fake fscrypt
    context. The fake fscrypt context is used by xfstests.
    The argument may be either "v1" or "v2", in order to
    select the corresponding fscrypt policy version.</td>
</tr>

(e. g. it would look like the first parameter lacks description)

Which is not the intended result. I was unable to identify a way 
to teach Sphinx that the second line was a continuation of the
first (A ReST equivalent to placing a \ at the end of a line).

Still, the html output with the above is not that bad, and it should be clear
for readers that the description of the second parameter is also valid for the
first.


Thanks,
Mauro
