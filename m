We already have "java" defined in existing compat_hwcap_str[] array even
though it might never get set in compat_elf_hwcap. AFAICS, compat_elf_hwcap
will have the following capabilities set (at the most).

Via COMPAT_ELF_HWCAP_DEFAULT

01.  COMPAT_HWCAP_HALF
02.  COMPAT_HWCAP_THUMB
03.  COMPAT_HWCAP_FAST_MULT
04.  COMPAT_HWCAP_EDSP
05.  COMPAT_HWCAP_TLS
06.  COMPAT_HWCAP_IDIV
07.  COMPAT_HWCAP_LPAE

Via setup_elf_hwcaps(compat_elf_hwcaps) <-- setup_cpu_features()

8.  COMPAT_HWCAP_NEON
9.  COMPAT_HWCAP_VFPv4
10. COMPAT_HWCAP_VFP
11. COMPAT_HWCAP_VFPv3

Via arch_timer_set_evtstrm_feature()

12. COMPAT_HWCAP_EVTSTRM

The code exists for "java" string to be displayed with /proc/cpuinfo but it
may never get triggered as compat_elf_hwcap will never have JAVA capability
unless there is a bug as you had rightly mentioned.

The current patch preserves status quo without fixing the underlying problem
("java" should have been dropped from possible /proc/cpuinfo display strings
as it can never happen). It tries to formalize what is already being done.

arch/arm64/kernel/cpuinfo.c

static int c_show(struct seq_file *m, void *v)
{
	....
#ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT
	for (j = 0; compat_hwcap_str[j]; j++)
		if (compat_elf_hwcap & (1 << j))
		seq_printf(m, " %s", compat_hwcap_str[j]);
	....
#endif
	....
}

When compat_hwcap_str[j] == "java" just define COMPAT_HWCAP_JAVA as (1 << j).

Right, dropping these above will fix the existing underlying problem. But the
only point here is should that be done in this patch (which keeps everything
as is) or with a separate patch fixing an already existing problem.

Understood, this patch was not trying to change the compat ABI. SWP just gets
carried over as is like before.
