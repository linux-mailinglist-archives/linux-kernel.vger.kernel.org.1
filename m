txt bindings are somewhat deprecated now, this specific binding was already
converted to the new json-schema, although didn't land yet, you should base your
changes on that, you can pick the following patch:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/devicetree-bindings/patch/20200306085513.76024-1-ikjn@chromium.org/

Also, the kernel test robot, reported a build problem, so fix the problems on
the second version.

Thanks,
 Enric
