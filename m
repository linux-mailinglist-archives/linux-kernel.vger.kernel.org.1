The "design" was to accept "sane" flags here:
	1, y, Y mean "enable"
	0, n, N mean "disable"

We never thought someone would try to write "0x01" as "enable" for a
boolean flag :)

So it's not a bad design, it works well what it was designed for.  It
just is NOT designed for hex values.

If your sysfs file is "enable/disable", then please, use kstrtobool, as
that is the standard way of doing this, and don't expect 0x01 to work :)
