I'm not entirely sure this makes sense. If the system in non-NUMA you
don't have nodes then do you?

This isn't quite true either is it? It is per-memcg and per-node isn't it?

Again, per-node x per-memcg. The list is not stored in just a per-node

Maybe instead of just replacing zone with node it might work better to

So I don't believe you are using ZONE_PADDING in any way to try and
protect the LRU lock currently. At least you aren't using it in the
lruvec. As such it might make sense to just drop the reference to the
lru_lock here. That reminds me that we still need to review the
placement of the lru_lock and determine if there might be a better
placement and/or padding that might improve performance when under
heavy stress.
