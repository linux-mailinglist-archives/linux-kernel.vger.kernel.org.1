What do you mean with NTP jumps?

Neither CLOCK_BOOTTIME nor CLOCK_MONOTONIC jump. They are frequency
corrected when NTP, PTP or PPS are in use. The frequency correction is
incremental an smothed. They really don't jump and they give you proper
time in nanoseconds which is as close to the real nanoseconds as it
gets.

CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW converts some assumed clock frequency into something
which looks like time. But it's raw and subject to drift. The only
reason why it's exposed is because NTP/PTP need it to calculate the
frequency difference between the hardware counter and the master clock.

I don't know how you read jumps into this:

  CLOCK_MONOTONIC

   Clock that cannot be set and represents monotonic time since some
   unspecified starting point.  This clock is not affected by
   discontinuous jumps in the system time (e.g., if the system
   administrator manually changes the clock), but is affected by the
   incremental adjustments performed by adjtime(3) and NTP.

And CLOCK_BOOTTIME is the same except that it accounts time in suspend
while MONOTONIC stops in suspend.

Nobody needs it and there is even no guarantee that it can be
reconstructed on resume.

If you want accurate time deltas then use either CLOCK_MONOTONIC or
CLOCK_BOOTTIME depending on your interest in suspend time.
