ehci, not echi.

Basically this new driver is fine.  However...

If this patch is going to be redone anyway, you might as well change
dev_err() to ehci_err() -- that's what it's for.  I should have noticed
this earlier, sorry.

I don't want to get involved in the question of whether or not 0 is a 
valid IRQ number.  The consensus has gone back and forth over the 
years, and it just doesn't seem important.

However, as Sergei points out, if 0 is going to be regarded as an 
invalid value then we shouldn't return 0 from the probe function here.

I'll leave the decision on how to handle this matter up to Greg.  :-)
