Not exactly nested calls, but kswapd threads are per numa node.
So, at some level nodes under pressure must be counted.

Also forcing rcu calls only for cpus in one numa node might be useful.


I wonder if direct-reclaim should at some stage simply wait for RCU QS.
I.e. call rcu_barrier() or similar somewhere before invoking OOM.

All GFP_NOFAIL users should allow direct-reclaim, thus this loop
in page_alloc shouldn't block RCU and doesn't need special care.
