So my understanding is the Android Common Kernel tree version was
mostly reworked to allow heaps as modules, and allowed heaps to have
their own exporter logic (not unlike how dmabuf heaps do it). The main
allocation interface is maybe slightly tweaked for out-of-tree vendor
heaps, but doesn't affect the in-staging heaps. There's also a few
optimizations we have skipped taking upstream. So yes, there are
differences, but I don't feel your characterization is quite accurate.

AOSP is what the next Android release forks off of, so it needs to be
fixed first.

Vendors usually target LTS releases for their hardware bringups.
Having a LTS release with both ION and DMA BUF Heaps helps them
validate their old ION solution as performant, and then migrate to DMA
BUF Heaps and be able to do performance comparisons holding all other
things equal.

Sure. Again, I do understand the desire to remove it, and it's your
right to do so. Keeping the code for an extra year in LTS (over 5.4)
is a cost, so I understand if you drop it. But I'll ask that you make
that judgement clear as the main motivator/rationale of the commit
message, rather than flippantly pretending it's not being used, and
that everyone agrees it has no usefulness to keep around (especially
after we've had this conversation a few times already this year).
