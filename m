Done.

Personally, I'm fine with either solution (as there's still dts
changes for db845c pending that we're carrying), but I also want to
make sure we're setting a good standard for future changes (as these
sorts of things seem to bite me far too frequently on the db845c,
sometimes even resulting in forced userland changes that we've so far
been able to adapt to, but are not ideal).

So I've resubmitted my version to let the maintainers decide.  :)
