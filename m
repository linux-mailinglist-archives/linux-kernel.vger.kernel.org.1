_no_ As explained above, this is not RT specific.
What guaranties that you don't have two flow_lookup() invocations on the
same CPU? You are using u64_stats_update_begin() which must not be
preempted. This means even if preemption is disabled you must not have
another invocation in BH context. This is due to the
write_seqcount_begin() in u64_stats_update_begin().
If preemption / CPU migration is not a problem in the above part, you
can use annotation to disable the warning that led to the warning. But
the u64_stats invocation looks still problematic.
