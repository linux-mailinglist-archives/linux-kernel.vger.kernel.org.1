Yup, the GPU has its own independent MMU, so Panfrost can import display 
buffers regardless of whether they're physically contiguous or not. 
Since Mesa master has recently landed AFBC support, there's probably 
more immediate benefit in getting that AFBC decoder working before the 
display MMU (although ultimately things are likely to work better under 
memory pressure if you don't have to rely on CMA, so it should still be 
worth coming back to at some point).

Robin.
