Right, but I would expect board files to disable not used peripherals,
peripherals which is not connected up in the board. Including i2c buses.

Even for peripherals which needs board specific properties and those
properties are mandatory for the IP to be operational and usable?

The McASP bindings demands several must be present properties
(tdm-slots, slot direction for example) and they are coming from the
board design.
Board files will disable all unused McASPs, they should. Imho the board
dts file represents the board design and the board design is to
_connect_ peripherals and not _disconnect_ them.
Why would a board file should be in charge to disable what is not
connected/used?

iow: what is the difference of a peripheral disabled in dtsi over a
peripheral disabled in board dts file?
