I do not object to your original fix with careful check for pfn validity.

But I still think that the memory reserved by the firmware is still
memory and it should be added to memblock.memory. This way the memory
map will be properly initialized from the very beginning and we won't
need init_unavailable_mem() and alike workarounds and. Obviously, the patch
above is not enough, but it's a small step in this direction.

I believe that improving the early memory initialization would make many
things simpler and more robust, but that's a different story :)

Mike.
