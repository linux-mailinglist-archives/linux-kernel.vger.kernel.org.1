Right, what I meant was that in this patch the kernel level
xsaves that populates the struct fpu always runs with
an unmodified XCR0, so the contents of the xsave area
in struct fpu does not change layout (this is the major
change in this patch over v1). Are you referring to a ptracer
which runs with a modified XCR0, and assumes that the
value it gets back from ptrace will have an XSTATE_BV
equal to its own observed XCR0 and thus get confused
about the layout of the buffer (or potentially have not copied
all of the relevant xstate because it calculated a wrong buffer
size)? If so, I think that's just a buggy ptracer. The kernel's
xfeature mask is available via ptrace and a well-behaved
ptracer should use that (e.g. gdb does, though it looks like
it then also assumes that the xstate has no holes, so it
potentially gets the layout wrong anyway).

In general, I don't really want the modified XCR0 to affect
anything other than the particular instructions that depend
on it and maybe the signal frame (though as I said before,
I'm open to either here).

If I misunderstood what you were trying to say, I apologize.

Yes, good idea. I will do this again. That said, I'm hoping that
the general principle to use the kernel layout, except perhaps
in the signal frame will hold and thus not require modification.

Luckily rr is fast enough (after much work) that there's almost
never a reason not to use it. Our developers essentially use
it exclusively (rather than raw gdb), and our users send us rr
traces as bug reports. It's basically become our one-stop-shop
for all things debugging on Linux.
