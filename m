Now, I'm confused; because this patch doesn't use the reg property
but a different node name. I'd actually prefer this for any MFD
driver which has multiple nodes of the same compatible string. See
my reasoning here [1]. But until now, no one has responded. Thus,
I'd rather see a OF_MFD_CELL_NAME() which matches the node name
instead of the OF_MFD_CELL_REG() macro.

This would also circumvent the fact that the unit-address has one
number space. Eg. it is not possible to have:

mfd {
   compatible = "mfd,compatible";

   gpio@0 {
     reg = <0>;
   };
   gpio@1 {
     reg = <1>;
   };
   pwm@0 {
     reg = <0>;
   };
};

Although Rob mentioned to maybe relax that, but I sill fail to see
the advantage to have an arbitrary reg property instead of a unique
node name.
