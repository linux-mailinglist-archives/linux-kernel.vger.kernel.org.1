+Introduction
+============
+
+The Intel(r) Dynamic Load Balancer 2.0 (Intel(r) DLB 2.0) is a PCIe device that
+provides load-balanced, prioritized scheduling of core-to-core communication.
+
+The Intel DLB 2.0 device consists of queues and arbiters that connect producer
+cores and consumer cores. The device implements load-balanced queueing features
+including:
+- Lock-free multi-producer/multi-consumer operation.
+- Multiple priority levels for varying traffic types.
+- 'Direct' traffic (i.e. multi-producer/single-consumer)
+- Simple unordered load-balanced distribution.
+- Atomic lock free load balancing across multiple consumers.
+- Queue element reordering feature allowing ordered load-balanced distribution.
+
+Intel DLB 2.0 can be used in an event-driven programming model, such as DPDK's
+Event Device Library[2]. Such frameworks are commonly used in packet processing
+pipelines that benefit from the framework's multi-core scalability, dynamic
+load-balancing, and variety of packet distribution and synchronization schemes.
+
+Scheduling Types
+================
+
+Intel DLB 2.0 supports four types of scheduling of 'events' (using DPDK
+terminology), where an event can represent any type of data (e.g. a network
+packet). The first, ``directed``, is multi-producer/single-consumer style
+core-to-core communication. The remaining three are
+multi-producer/multi-consumer, and support load-balancing across the consumers.
+
+- ``Unordered``: events are load-balanced across consumers without any ordering
+                 guarantees.
+
+- ``Ordered``: events are load-balanced across consumers, and when the consumer
+               re-injects each event into the device it is re-ordered into the
+               original order. This scheduling type allows software to
+               parallelize ordered event processing without the synchronization
+               cost of re-ordering packets.
+
+- ``Atomic``: events are load-balanced across consumers, with the guarantee that
+              events from a particular 'flow' are only scheduled to a single
+              consumer at a time (but can migrate over time). This allows, for
+              example, packet processing applications to parallelize while
+              avoiding locks on per-flow data and maintaining ordering within a
+              flow.
+
+Intel DLB 2.0 provides hierarchical priority scheduling, with eight priority
+levels within each. Each consumer selects up to eight queues to receive events
+from, and assigns a priority to each of these 'connected' queues. To schedule
+an event to a consumer, the device selects the highest priority non-empty queue
+of the (up to) eight connected queues. Within that queue, the device selects
+the highest priority event available (selecting a lower priority event for
+starvation avoidance 1% of the time, by default).
+
+The device also supports four load-balanced scheduler classes of service. Each
+class of service receives a (user-configurable) guaranteed percentage of the
+scheduler bandwidth, and any unreserved bandwidth is divided evenly among the
+four classes.
+
+Queue Entry
+===========
+
+Each event is contained in a queue entry (QE), the fundamental unit of
+communication through the device, which consists of 8B of data and 8B of
+metadata, as depicted below.
+
+QE structure format
+::
+    data     :64
+    opaque   :16
+    qid      :8
+    sched    :2
+    priority :3
+    msg_type :3
+    lock_id  :16
+    rsvd     :8
+    cmd      :8
+
+The ``data`` field can be any type that fits within 8B (pointer, integer,
+etc.); DLB 2.0 merely copies this field from producer to consumer. The
+``opaque`` and ``msg_type`` fields behave the same way.
+
+``qid`` is set by the producer to specify to which DLB 2.0 queue it wishes to
+enqueue this QE. The ID spaces for load-balanced and directed queues are both
+zero-based; the ``sched`` field is used to distinguish whether the queue is
+load-balanced or directed.
+
+``sched`` controls the scheduling type: atomic, unordered, ordered, or
+directed. The first three scheduling types are only valid for load-balanced
+queues, and the directed scheduling type is only valid for directed queues.
+
+``priority`` is the priority with which this QE should be scheduled.
+
+``lock_id``, used only by atomic scheduling, identifies the atomic flow to
+which the QE belongs. When sending a directed event, ``lock_id`` is simply
+copied like the ``data``, ``opaque``, and ``msg_type`` fields.
+
+``cmd`` specifies the operation, such as:
+- Enqueue a new QE
+- Forward a QE that was dequeued
+- Complete/terminate a QE that was dequeued
+- Return one or more consumer queue tokens.
+- Arm the port's consumer queue interrupt.
+
+Port
+====
+
+A core's interface to the DLB 2.0 is called a "port," and consists of an MMIO
+region through which the core enqueues a queue entry, and an in-memory queue
+(the "consumer queue") to which the device schedules QEs. A core enqueues a QE
+to a device queue, then the device schedules the event to a port. Software
+specifies the connection of queues and ports; i.e. for each queue, to which
+ports the device is allowed to schedule its events. The device uses a credit
+scheme to prevent overflow of the on-device queue storage.
+
+Applications interface directly with the device by mapping the port's memory
+and MMIO regions into the application's address space for enqueue and dequeue
+operations, but call into the kernel driver for configuration operations. An
+application can also be polling- or interrupt-driven; DLB 2.0 supports both
+modes of operation.
+
+Queue
+=====
+
+The device contains 32 load-balanced (i.e. capable of atomic, ordered, and
+unordered scheduling) queues and 64 directed queues. Each queue comprises 8
+internal queues, one per priority level. The internal queue that an event is
+enqueued to is selected by the event's priority field.
+
+A load-balanced queue is capable of scheduling its events to any combination of
+load-balanced ports, whereas each directed queue has one-to-one mapping with a
+directed port. There is no restriction on port or queue types when a port
+enqueues an event to a queue; that is, a load-balanced port can enqueue to a
+directed queue and vice versa.
+
+Credits
+=======
+
+The Intel DLB 2.0 uses a credit scheme to prevent overflow of the on-device
+queue storage, with separate credits for load-balanced and directed queues. A
+port spends one credit when it enqueues a QE, and one credit is replenished
+when a QE is scheduled to a consumer queue. Each scheduling domain has one pool
+of load-balanced credits and one pool of directed credits; software is
+responsible for managing the allocation and replenishment of these credits among
+the scheduling domain's ports.
+
+Scheduling Domain
+=================
+
+Device resources -- including ports, queues, and credits -- are contained
+within a scheduling domain. Scheduling domains are isolated from one another; a
+port can only enqueue to and dequeue from queues within its scheduling domain.
+
+A scheduling domain's resources are configured through a domain file descriptor,
+which is acquired through an ioctl. This design means that any application with
+sufficient permissions to access the device file can request the fd of any
+scheduling domain within that device. When necessary to prevent independent dlb2
+applications from potentially accessing each other's scheduling domains, the
+user can create multiple virtual functions (each with its own device file) and
+restrict access via file permissions.
+
+Consumer Queue Interrupts
+=========================
+
+Each port has its own interrupt which fires, if armed, when the consumer queue
+depth becomes non-zero. Software arms an interrupt by enqueueing a special
+'interrupt arm' command to the device through the port's MMIO window.
+
+Power Management
+================
+
+The kernel driver keeps the device in D3Hot when not in use. The driver
+transitions the device to D0 when the first device file is opened or a virtual
+function is created, and keeps it there until there are no open device files,
+memory mappings, or virtual functions.
+
+Virtualization
+==============
+
+The DLB 2.0 supports both SR-IOV and Scalable IOV, and can flexibly divide its
+resources among the physical function (PF) and its virtual devices. Virtual
+devices do not configure the device directly; they use a hardware mailbox to
+proxy configuration requests to the PF driver. Mailbox communication is
+initiated by the virtual device with a registration message that establishes
+the mailbox interface version.
+
+SR-IOV
+------
+
+Each SR-IOV virtual function (VF) has 32 interrupts, 1 for PF->VF mailbox
+messages and the remainder for CQ interrupts. If a VF user (e.g. a guest OS)
+needs more CQ interrupts, they have to use more than one VF.
+
+To support this case, the driver introduces the notion of primary and auxiliary
+VFs. A VF is either considered primary or auxiliary:
+- Primary: the VF is used as a regular DLB 2.0 device. The primary VF has 0+
+           auxiliary VFs supporting it.
+- Auxiliary: the VF doesn't have any resources of its own, and serves only to
+             provide the primary VF with MSI vectors for its CQ interrupts.
+
+Each VF has an aux_vf_ids file in its sysfs directory, which is a R/W file that
+controls the primary VF’s auxiliaries. When a VF is made auxiliary to another,
+its resources are relinquished to the PF device.
+
+When the VF driver registers its device with the PF driver, the PF driver tells
+the VF driver whether its device is auxiliary or primary, and if so then the ID
+of its primary VF. If it is auxiliary, the VF device will “claim” up to 31 of
+the primary VF’s CQs, such that they use the auxiliary VF’s MSI vectors.
+
+When a primary VF has one or more auxiliary VFs, the entire VF group must be
+assigned to the same virtual machine. The PF driver will not allow the primary
+VF to configure its resources until all its auxiliary VFs have been registered
+by the guest OS’s driver.
+
+Scalable IOV
+------------
+
+Scalable IOV is a virtualization solution that, compared to SR-IOV, enables
+highly-scalable, high-performance, and fine-grained sharing of I/O devices
+across isolated domains.
+
+In Scalable IOV, the smallest granularity of sharing a device is the Assignable Device
+Interface (ADI). Similar to SR-IOV’s Virtual Function, Scalable IOV defines the
+Virtual Device (VDEV) as the abstraction at which a Scalable IOV device is exposed to
+guest software, and a VDEV contains one or more ADIs.
+
+Kernel software is responsible for composing and managing VDEV instances in
+Scalable IOV. The device-specific software components are the Host (PF) Driver,
+the Guest (VDEV) Driver, and the Virtual Device Composition Module (VDCM). The
+VDCM is responsible for managing the software-based virtualization of (slow)
+control path operations, like the mailbox between Host and Guest drivers.
+
+For DLB 2.0, the ADI is the scheduling domain, which consists of load-balanced
+and directed queues, ports, and other resources. Each port, whether
+load-balanced or directed, consists of:
+- A producer port: a 4-KB separated MMIO window
+- A consumer queue: a memory-based ring to which the device writes queue entries
+- One CQ interrupt message
+
+DLB 2.0 supports up to 16 VDEVs per PF.
+
+For Scalable IOV guest-host communication, DLB 2.0 uses a software-based
+mailbox. This mailbox interface matches the SR-IOV hardware mailbox (i.e. PF2VF
+and VF2PF MMIO regions) except that it is backed by shared memory (allocated
+and managed by the VDCM). Similarly, the VF2PF interrupt trigger register
+instead causes a VM exit into the VDCM driver, and the PF2VF interrupt is
+replaced by a virtual interrupt injected into the guest through the VDCM.
+
+User Interface
+==============
+
+The dlb2 driver uses ioctls as its primary interface. It provides two types of
+files: the dlb2 device file and the scheduling domain file.
+
+The two types support different ioctl interfaces; the dlb2 device file is used
+for device-wide operations (including scheduling domain creation), and the
+scheduling domain device file supports operations on the scheduling domain's
+resources such as port and queue configuration.
+
+The driver also exports an mmap interface through port files, which are
+acquired through scheduling domain ioctls. This mmap interface is used to map
+a port's memory and MMIO window into the process's address space.
+
+Reset
+=====
+
+The dlb2 driver supports reset at two levels: scheduling domain and device-wide
+(i.e. FLR).
+
+Scheduling domain reset occurs when an application stops using its domain.
+Specifically, when no more file references or memory mappings exist. At this
+time, the driver resets all the domain's resources (flushes its queues and
+ports) and puts them in their respective available-resource lists for later
+use.
+
+An FLR can occur while the device is in use by user-space software, so the
+driver uses its reset_prepare callback to ensure that no applications continue
+to use the device while the FLR executes. First, the driver blocks user-space
+from executing ioctls or opening a device file, and evicts any threads blocked
+on a CQ interrupt. The driver then notifies applications and virtual functions
+that an FLR is pending, and waits for them to clean up with a timeout (default
+of 5 seconds). If the timeout expires and the device is still in use by an
+application, the driver zaps its MMIO mappings. Virtual functions, whether in
+use or not, are reset as part of a PF FLR.
+
+While PF FLR is a hardware procedure, VF FLR is a software procedure. When a
+VF FLR is triggered, this causes an interrupt to be delivered to the PF driver,
+which performs the actual reset. This consists of performing the scheduling
+domain reset operation for each of the VF's scheduling domains.
