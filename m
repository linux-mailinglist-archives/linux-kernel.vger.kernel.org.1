Right, AFAICT we get SD_SERIALIZE wherever we have SD_NUMA, which is any
level above NODE.

It does, although we can still degenerate it, see below.

So from what I've tested we still get rid of those via
sd_parent_degenerate(): child and parent have the same flags and same span,
so parent goes out.

That happens in the middle of the NUMA topology levels on that borked
topology with weird distances, aka

  node distances:
  node   0   1   2   3
    0:  10  12  20  22
    1:  12  10  22  24
    2:  20  22  10  12
    3:  22  24  12  10

which ought to look something like (+local distance to end result)

      2      10      2
  1 <---> 0 <---> 2 <---> 3

We end up with the following NUMA levels (i.e. deduplicated distances)
  NUMA (<= 12)
  NUMA (<= 20)
  NUMA (<= 22)
  NUMA (<= 24)

For e.g. any CPU of node1, NUMA(<=20) is gonna have the same span as
NUMA(<=12), so we'll degenerate it.
