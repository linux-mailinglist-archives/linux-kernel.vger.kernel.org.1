It looks like the NULL check could be removed, but it's also fine to
keep it so long as it's not after a NULL dereference.

Do whatever you have the energy to do...  It would be nice if people who
fix bugs in these Realtek drivers would check the other drivers as well
but for cleanups basically everyone just works on one driver only.
