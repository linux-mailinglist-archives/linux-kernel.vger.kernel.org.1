Thanks for having a look a this!

Ah, so that's what the problem was. Good job finding the problem!

If there is no contention then an always-one refcount and an enum are
the same thing.
I'd rather not make a difference but make it a full-fledged refcount
thing; the enum in the code introduces quite a bit of code churn that
doesn't strike me as useful (and I don't like int arguments like this,
but if we can just do away with it there's no need to argue about that)

Not having exceptions for that will also make the code around
fid_atomic_dec much simpler: just have clunk do an atomic dec and only
do the actual clunk if that hit zero, and we should be able to get rid
of that helper?


Timing wise it's a bit awkward but I just dug out the async clunk
mechanism I wrote two years ago, that will conflict with this patch but
might also help a bit I guess?
I should probably have reposted them...


So to recap:
 - Let's try some more straight-forward refcounting: set to 1 on alloc,
increment when it's found in fid.c, decrement in clunk and only send the
actual clunk if counter hit 0

 - Ideally base yourself of my 9p-test branch to have async clunk:
https://github.com/martinetd/linux/commits/9p-test
I've been promising to push it to next this weekâ„¢ for a couple of weeks
but if something is based on it I won't be able to delay this much
longer, it'll get pushed to 5.10 cycle anyway.
(I'll resend the patches to be clean)

 - (please, no polling 10ms then leaking something!)


Thanks,
