Heh, those are bad examples.  Although the single HD-audio driver
supports (literally) thousands of different models and hardware
configurations, it's more or less self-contained; i.e. it needs
neither UCM nor exotic setups.  IOW, user-space don't need much to
care about the difference of the hardware.  (Admittedly there are
subtle things to be done for HD-audio, too, but PA can handle it in a
generic way, for example.)

OTOH, in general, ASoC drivers do need the individual setups; that's
almost unavoidable from its design perspective.  Hence, unless the
identical configuration is needed, it'd be wiser to provide different
driver names to identify which setup to be applied.
