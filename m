I guess a comment is best, as that's most likely to be seen by people
looking at the code in future.

A little bit of overview in the change log is also good.

Yeah OK.

In that scenario it's not really clear what the 8 thread level domain
expresses, if the two "halves" of the bigcore have separate L2s. But
presumably there is still some benefit to exposing it.

cheers
