Thinks.... (smoke comes out of ears...):
If the 'trace entry' contained the pid and whether it was a pr_cont
then the trace reader could merge continuation lines even if
there was a small number of interleaved other traces.

So anything reading continuously might break a continuation
(as might happen if there is a trace from an ISR).
But the output from dmesg and /var/log/messages will
almost always be correct.

This moves all the complexity away from the trace writing code.

My annoyance is that I want printk() to come out on the console
(like it used to 30 years ago).
I don't want the console output to be from a syslogd process.
On SYSV killing syslogd (mostly) did the trick.
x86 is annoying because you need to have setup a serial console
(or have a high speed camera pointing at the vga monitor).

I was thinking of just catching the case where pr_cont()
data can't be appended to the earlier line.

For direct tty output this would happen if an intervening
printk() had to add an extra '\n' to terminate the partial line.
