A direct reply is to ask what the purpose of poll_enable_rx_int()
is? It appears to be making something modular without any reason to do
so.

More generally lets ask some more questions:

1. What serial hardware and/or driver state change happens when we call
   poll_get_irq()

2. After a call to poll_get_irq() are there any new restrictions on
   the underlying serial driver?

3. Does implementing poll_get_irq() create an implied change of
   contract to any other polling function (I think yes, because
   poll_read_char() will now have to acknowledge an interrupt if
   the interrupt flags are edge triggered)?

4. To what extent, if any, do we have to support disconnection of
   kgdb_nmi?

5. Is the API matched with how it will be used by the layers above?
   (top level uses a request_irq approach, low level is using a
   let me have the irq number approach)

An interesting idea to explore is using a different verb for
poll_get_irq(). Perhaps poll_borrow_irq()? It is now much clearer that
we are stealing the IRQ and making it unusable by the underlying serial
driver.

It is likely that one of the interrupt handlers will become unreachable
since the first handler to execute will clear the interrupt flags. This
will result in anything waiting for the broken driver getting stuck and
not reporting an error code.

That isn't acceptable.
