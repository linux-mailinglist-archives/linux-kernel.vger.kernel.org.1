Not as much as I'd like but, in principle at least, I think the trap
handler is written to make it an architecture decision to whether it
will be entered with interrupt disabled or not (which would in turn
depend on how the architecture manages exception stacks and what else
it uses the breakpoint machinery for).

I'm not yet in a position to test kgdb on all architectures. Mostly
this is because it can be hard to discover suitable qemu stanzas to
launch an emulator... and in one case because buildroot doesn't support
cross-gdb yet. Anyhow, right now, it is difficult to tour the niche
architectures to give a definitive answer.

I'm still a little reluctant on this.

It's not that I think the current patch is buggy, more that I view the
interrupt locks as the place in the function that we start to "assert"
what our execution context is going to be. Seeing all the entry/exit
logic in one place makes reasoning easier and should make the eventual
refactoring of "the beast" a little easier too.

Are you feeling lucky?

I think there will come a time when bravery is called for but I'd rather
see this as part of a bigger rewrite instead of a single high risk
change.
