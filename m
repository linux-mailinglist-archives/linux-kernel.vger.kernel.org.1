I was referring to userspace tuning, which I expected to be platform specific.
Assuming the devices share the same kernel. At least in the context of uclamp
and RT tuning that should be possible.

I appreciate that you want to ship a simple generic setup on as many
devices. But there will be a trade-off to make between optimal tuning and
keeping things simple and generic. The latter is perfectly fine goal to have
of course. Others who want to tune more they're free to do so too as well.

You can always use the per-task API to boost that task to maximum, if power is
not your concern. From user-space ;-)

If you're power conscious too, yeah there's no way but to test for the minimum
value that gives you what you want. The task can try to regulate itself too if
it can observe when it's not running fast enough (notices a glitch?).

You can get fancy if you want, depending on your goal.

It's hard to get the best though with one size fits all.
