Yes, we inherited this from ARM and I think strace relies on it. In
hindsight, it is a little odd, although x7 is a parameter register in the
PCS and so it won't be live on entry to a system call.

I'm not opposed to extending ptrace so that we can try to wean people off
this interface, but I think we need some concrete situations where the
current behaviour actually causes a problem. Although the examples you've
listed above are interesting, I don't see why x7 is important in any of
them (and we only support up to 6 system call arguments).
