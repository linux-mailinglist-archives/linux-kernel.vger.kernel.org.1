the move from platform-device to virtual-device should happen once
the virtual-bus' is accepted upstream. till then imo you should continue
with current platform device and once you have virtual-bus upstream,
replace it with virtual-device. Note: I am going to hold you on that :)

Rest of the pieces like sdw_master_device and sysfs parts are not
dependent upon this and should be sent for review and we can merge when
ready, hopefully for 5.8.
