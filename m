Rust has hard stability guarantees when upgrading from one stable
version to the next. If code compiles with a given stable version of
Rust, it'll compile with a newer stable version of Rust. Given that, a
stable distribution will just need a single sufficiently up-to-date Rust
that meets the minimum version requirements of both Firefox and Linux.

(That would not apply if the kernel used nightly Rust, since
nightly-only features are allowed to change before becoming stable;
that's one reason why we should use stable Rust, and try to get Firefox
to stick to stable Rust.)
