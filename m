So you're saying that

	echo xxx > /sys/block/dm/queue/read_ahead_kb

does not affect presently-open files, and you believe that it should do
so?

I guess that could be a reasonable thing to want - it's reasonable for
a user to expect that writing to a global tunable will take immediate
global effect.  I guess.

But as Matthew says, it would help if you were to explain why this is
needed.  In full detail.  What operational problems is the present
implementation causing?
