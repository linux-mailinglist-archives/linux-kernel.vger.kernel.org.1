Hi,

After upgrading from 3.14 to 4.14.173, I ran into exactly the same problem
that the starter topic described. Namely, sometimes kswapd starts to consume 100% 
of the CPU, and the system freezes for several minutes.

Below is an example of such an event (orange - system cpu, red - total cpu):
https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wr5su3p0fubq0a/kswapd_100.png?dl=0

Here is the top:

this is a begin of the collapse, some minutes later the system has thousands of D
processes and does not answer:

Nevertheless there is not any I/O activity before after and during this collapse.

I tried to use your patch about "late_initcall(set_recommended_min_free_kbytes)",
unfortunately it did not help.

In my experience this could be solved by adding RAM but unfortunately this server
no longer has free slots. 188 GB RAM is the maximum for it.

Also I cannot go back to 3.14 kernel, since one of the partitions contains xfs with
the superblock of the new version v5, which is not supported by 3.14 kernel.

If you need more information, for example, vmstat, /proc/meminfo, I can send.

Is there any solution to this problem?
