The current implementation of fw_devlink is very inefficient because it
tries to get away without creating fwnode links in the name of saving
memory usage. Past attempts to optimize runtime at the cost of memory
usage were blocked with request for data showing that the optimization
made significant improvement for real world scenarios.

We have those scenarios now. There have been several reports of boot
time increase in the order of seconds in this thread [1]. Several OEMs
and SoC manufacturers have also privately reported significant
(350-400ms) increase in boot time due to all the parsing done by
fw_devlink.

So this patch series refactors fw_devlink to be more efficient. The key
difference now is the addition of support for fwnode links -- just a few
simple APIs. This also allows most of the code to be moved out of
firmware specific (DT mostly) code into driver core.

This brings the following benefits:
- Instead of parsing the device tree multiple times (complexity was
  close to O(N^3) where N in the number of properties) during bootup,
  fw_devlink parses each fwnode node/property only once and creates
  fwnode links. The rest of the fw_devlink code then just looks at these
  fwnode links to do rest of the work.

- Makes it much easier to debug probe issue due to fw_devlink in the
  future. fw_devlink=on blocks the probing of devices if they depend on
  a device that hasn't been added yet. With this refactor, it'll be very
  easy to tell what that device is because we now have a reference to
  the fwnode of the device.

- Much easier to add fw_devlink support to ACPI and other firmware
  types. A refactor to move the common bits from DT specific code to
  driver core was in my TODO list as a prerequisite to adding ACPI
  support to fw_devlink. This series gets that done.

Laurent and Grygorii tested the v1 series and they saw boot time
improvment of about 12 seconds and 3 seconds, respectively.

Thanks,
Saravana
