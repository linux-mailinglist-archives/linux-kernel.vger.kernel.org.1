Hmm... I think that it's not that hard to decide correct macro. If we renam=
e
PageHighMem() with PageDirectMapped(), they, PageDirectMapped() and
PageHighMemZone(), are self-explanation macro. There would be no
confusion to use.

Yes and my assumption is that we (MM) have agreed with usefulness of
CMA series.

Correct!

So, do you mean to send the new version of CMA patchset with more
explanation before merging this patchset? If yes, I can do. But, I'm not su=
re
that it's worth doing. Problems of CMA are still not solved although
the utilization problem will be partially solved by Roman's "mm,page_alloc,=
cma:
conditionally prefer cma pageblocks for movable allocations" patch
in this (v5.7) release. Rationale that we agree with CMA patchset is still
remained.

Anyway, if you mean that, I will send the CMA patchset with more explanatio=
n.

Thanks.
