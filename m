As a person who has to touch multiple subsystems regularly while doing
treewide changes, I'm WAY happier to have a distinct set of maintainers
for specific files, and I can track the patch acceptance because I see
them appearing in a specific tree (via -next, etc).

Eh? I don't see a conspiracy here; I think you are, as you suggest above,
completely wrong. ;) I haven't seen the private emails, obviously, but
what I see here is just Christian's drive to get things nailed down. It
sounds like the "here's who to CC" part of the MAINTAINERS file was
agreed to, but there was a misunderstanding about the resolution of
group maintainership?

Agreed; if this was in place a few years ago, it might have been a bit
easier to direct and land some of the (now straggling) refcount_t
conversion patches.

O_O  I find this opinion very surprising. I hold Christian's judgement
in high regard (and yours). He's tackled the pidfd API (which solves so
many ancient gnarly problems with pid management) in a clean, measured,
and consistent manner. He and Aleksa have diligently worked on extensible
syscalls, which solve years of headaches over code maintainability, and
Christian regularly adds kernel selftests. I think he's absolutely got the
best interests of other developers (and users) in mind. Certainly none
of us are perfect, but your statement feels way way off base to me.

I think you both want the same thing (generally awesome Linux,
specifically sane and safe namespaces), and I think you're both deeply
involved in the namespace code and the use-cases, so it seems natural
to me that you'd have some form of shared maintainership. To that end, I
hope this can get sorted out. I'd like to have a tree I can count on to
have patches reviewed (and hopefully landed) that touch these areas.

To me, it seems like there has just been an impedance mismatch on the
expectations/priorities of communication speed. I don't see bad
motivations here at all.

Obviously y'all still need to finish this discussion, I but I'd expect a
single tree at the end of the day. No other subsystem has multiple trees
that I can find:

$ git grep -A1 ^T: -- MAINTAINERS  | grep -- -T: | wc -l
0

And please use the "git" format for T: so you can specify branches,
which helps immensely in tracking down "latest" commits:

T: git git://URL/TREE.git BRANCH

No other trees use a bare https schema:

$ git grep ^T: -- MAINTAINERS | grep "git " | wc -l
632
$ git grep ^T: -- MAINTAINERS | grep -v "git "
