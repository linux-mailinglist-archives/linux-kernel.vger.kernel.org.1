I checked with the debug team and there is a limitation with
the replicator(swao_replicator) in the AOSS group where it
loses the idfilter register context when the clock is disabled.
This is not just in SC7180 SoC but also reported on some latest
upcoming QCOM SoCs as well and will need to be taken care in
order to enable coresight on these chipsets.

Here's what's happening -  After the replicator is initialized,
the clock is disabled in amba_pm_runtime_suspend() as a part of
pm runtime workqueue with the assumption that there will be no
loss of context after the replicator is initialized. But it doesn't
hold good with the replicators with these unfortunate limitation
and the idfilter register context is lost.

This is a platform/SoC specific replicator issue, so we can either
introduce some DT property for replicators to identify which replicator
has this limitation, check in replicator_enable() and reset the 
registers
or have something like below diff to check the idfilter registers in
replicator_enable() and then reset with clear comment specifying it’s 
the
hardware limitation on some QCOM SoCs. Please let me know your thoughts 
on
this?
