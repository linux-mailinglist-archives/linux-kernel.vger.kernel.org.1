Hello Barry,

Right, it makes sense to avoid nodes without memory, hence loosing portions
of CMA reservation intended for HugeTLB. N_MEMORY is better than N_ONLINE
and will help avoid this situation.

As expected.

I would not say that it is 'broken'. It is just not optimal but still works
as designed.

As expected, the per node CMA reservation quota has changed from N_ONLINE
to N_MEMORY.

There is nothing arm64 specific here. A platform where N_ONLINE != N_MEMORY
i.e with some nodes without memory when CMA reservation gets called, will
have this problem.

The problem is always there if N_ONLINE != N_MEMORY but in this case, it
is just hidden because N_ONLINE happen to match N_MEMORY during the boot
process when hugetlb_cma_reserve() gets called.

cma_hugetlb_reserve() will now scan over N_MEMORY and hence expects all
platforms to have N_MEMORY initialized properly before calling it. This
needs to be well documented for the hugetlb_cma_reserve() function along
with it's call sites.

I would not call this a "Fix". The current code still works, though in
a sub optimal manner.

Needs better wording here, in particular a reference to free_area_init()
that updates N_MEMORY via node_set_state(). Also mention the fact that
now hugetlb_cma_reserve() scans over N_MEMORY nodemask and hence expects
the platforms to have a properly initialized one.

Drop the last sentence here. Should have just the same comment as arm64.

The patch makes sense. But it needs better articulation of the problem in
the commit message, specifically pointing out the fact that it originates
primarily from a scenario where N_ONLINE != N_MEMORY because the presence
of memory less online nodes. It manifests itself on arm64 because of how
N_ONLINE and N_MEMORY gets initialized during boot but remains hidden on
x86 for the very same reason.
