Currently MHI core driver files are under bus/mhi/core. Since MHI 
clients sit on top of core layer of MHI driver, i can move uci.c 
directly under /bus/mhi/.

Thanks for pointing it out, will add in next patch set.

how about adding
mhi_uci-y		:= uci.o
obj-$(CONFIG_MHI_UCI)	+= mhi_uci.o

Idea was to initialize with invalid value, i can leave it zero initialized.

Reason for using open_count was to allow start MHI channel only when 
first open() was called and stop the MHI channel when last release() is 
called. Since uci driver just need to handle one open() from user space
other calls to open can simply return -EBUSY. i will get rid of 
open_count and does not let multiple threads to open same file node.
