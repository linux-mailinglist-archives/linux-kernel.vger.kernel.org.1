 Dear Sir/Madam


 I work as an agent to some Investors. Do you need a business loan or
 funds for a business idea or want to expand but need huge funding? We
 are expanding our investment presence by granting debt loan to fund
 viable and lucrative projects. If you have any project that needs
 funding, kindly revert to me with your business plan and if we find
 your business to be worthy of investment, you will be promptly
 contacted and both parties will meet face to face and have a
 round-table meeting together.

 Good documentation will be carried out between you and the Investor
 before putting down his funds.

 Regards



 williams richard
