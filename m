It is not about the impact on the API. It is about the layering
violation: all masters in a system will be affected by DMA addressing
limitations, and all will be affected by the performance impact of
bounce buffering when it is needed. DMA accessible memory is generally
'owned' by the DMA layer so it can be used for bounce buffering for
all masters. If one device starts claiming DMA-able memory for its own
use, other masters could be adversely affected, given that they may
not be able to do DMA at all (not even via bounce buffers) once a
single master uses up all DMA-able memory.
