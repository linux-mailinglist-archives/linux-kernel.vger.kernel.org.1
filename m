I have now been through the whole series, and I don't think there is
anything really major (although I haven't tried it yet).

I think it would benefit from being rebased on top of kvmarm/queue, as
it'd give you the opportunity to replace a number of per-CPU state
fields with global function pointers. Another thing is that we seem to
have diverging interpretations of the PSCI spec when it comes to
CPU_SUSPEND.

Finally, please include the PSCI maintainers in your next posting, as
I'll need their Ack to pick the first few patches.

Thanks,

	M.
