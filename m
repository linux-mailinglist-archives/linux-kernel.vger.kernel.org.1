Fair enough.

Right, so I am not disagreeing at all with the above. FWIW, I expect
Android to set this default value to 0 as you mentioned, so that uclamp
basically becomes 'opt-in' for _all_ tasks, including RT.

Now, given that Qais' patch is commiting something to userspace, I think
it makes sense to expose the full range rather than a boolean value, as
it's probably more future-proof. That is, if we expose a boolean knob
now, and somebody wants to be able to set a default value in the middle
in a few years, we'll have to add another knob, and maintain both (which
sucks). But it's just my personal opinion. Feel free to jump in the
other thread if you feel differently :)

Cheers,
Quentin
