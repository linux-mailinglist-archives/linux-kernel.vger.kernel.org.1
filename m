I split the wait queue changes into a separate patch...

I added __seccomp_filter_release() to do the filter-specific parts (the
two functions passing "orig" above, so that it can be reused later...

I switched this around to just call the new __seccomp_release_filter()
(there's no need to open-code this and add "cur"). I also removed the
comment about the notification, because that's not possible: "thread"
shares the same filter hierarchy as "caller", so the counts on "cur"
cannot reach 0 (no notifications can ever happen due to TSYNC).

Everything else looks great! I've applied it to for-next/seccomp.
