Ideally yes, but it would be made more complex by the chip flexibility:
it's possible to choose which enable pin should drive each output.

For example this configuration is supported by the chip:

- BUCK0 is on if EN_BUCK0 high AND pin EN0 is active
- BUCK1 is on if EN_BUCK1 high AND pin EN0 is active
- BUCK2 is on if EN_BUCK2 high AND pin EN1 is active
- BUCK3 is on if EN_BUCK3 high (no pin used)
- pin EN2 is used as a GPIO (LP875xx acts as an I2C GPIO expander)

So it would be absolutely OK to describe in DT that EN0 and EN1 connect
the SoC to the LP875xx and that EN2 is connected to something else.

But describing in DT the association between enable pins and buck
outputs would be more a configuration than hardware description IMO.

And I'm not even considering the case where the enable pins are be
connected to something else, out of the SoC control, but still meant to
be used to control the buck output.

Exactly, each buck output has a register containing the bits involved in
this discussion.
