There's no behaviour difference due to endianness in this test itself --
just word size was a topic, hence that BITS_PER_LONG usage with
redundant values (checked on i686).

That is, if you have:
	{ 0x0000ffffUL, 0x5a5a5a5aUL, 0x5a5a5a5aUL, 0x5a5a5a5aUL },

then 1 as array subscript always denotes the second item (from the left)
there, it doesn't matter how and where different architectures store it.

Indeed, if bitmap_cut() directly addressed single bytes within the
words, I would need to pay special attention there. The values I picked
for these tests are also meant to show any issue in that sense.

I did that already on s390x (of course, I thought :)), I can confirm
that. Without patch 1/2 the test also fails there:

[   20.917848] test_bitmap: [lib/test_bitmap.c:666] bitmaps contents differ: expected "0-16,18-19,21,24,26-27,29", got "1,3-4,6,9,11-12,14,16,18-19,21,24,26-27,29"

If Alexander wants to test this on a z14 or z15, sure, it won't harm.

By the way, tests for 'parse', 'parse_user' and 'parselist' report
issues:

and at a glance those *seem* to be bugs in the tests themselves, not in
the actual functions they test. Sure, they should be fixed, but I can't
take care of that right now.
