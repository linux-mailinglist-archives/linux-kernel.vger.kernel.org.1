You'll have to take into account that there are more boot options than
uboot ;-) ... especially the rk3288 also needs to support some ancient
version of coreboot - that definitly won't see any updates anymore
and isn't really user upgradeable.

I'm still all for "just put a rk3288w" into the devicetree compatible,
but so far other participants seem to prefer a software solution ;-) .

The problem is, the "known physical address" is part of the dw-hdmi
controller ip block, so we'll also need to take into account clocks and
power-domains.

So that would mean the soc-"driver" would need to 
- ioremap hdmi, cru and pmu
- ungate all clocks (on reboot we don't know the hirarchy)
- enable at least the pd_vio power-domain
via direct register writes.

Doable but definitly very ugly and I also don't really know what more
people farther upstream would say to that.

Anybody interested in just adding that new dt-compatible?
