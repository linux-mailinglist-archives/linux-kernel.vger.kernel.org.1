Right, many things are tradeoff.  Seems we arrived in the point, though we
still have different opinions.  To summarize the pros and cons of my patch from
my perspective:

Pros 1: Handle future terms deprecated with different reasons and coverages.
Pros 2: Inappropriate patches are avoided if the submitters carefully read the
warning messages.
Cons: Careless people could still bother maintainers by not carefully reading
the message and sending inappropriate patches.

To me, the pros still seems larger than the cons.  I would like to also again
mention that the maintainer who first reported the problem, Michal, told it's
ok with the explicit messaging.  Nonethelss, this is just my opinion.

Attaching the patch addressing your comments for the previous version.  The
changes from the previous version are:

 - Make the name of reported terms not too verbose
 - Avoid unnecessary initialization of the reported terms hash
 - Warn multiple deprecated terms in same line


Thanks,
SeongJae Park


p.s I modified my mail formatter to skip adding 'Re:' in the subject.  I
thought it's usual behavior of the mailers, but seems it made you only
annoying, sorry.  I will not add more 'Re:' for you.

Subject: [PATCH v3] scripts/deprecatd_terms: provide references

Deprecation of terms could have special rules.  For example, 'slave' is
ok for existing usages.  Same to 'master', but it's also ok unless it's
used with 'slave'.  This commit provides the references for such rules.

Also, because the report became more verbose a little, this commit makes
the report to be made for only one instance of each deprecated term.
