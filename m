Hello Jann, thanks for your reply.

The randomized quarantine will release the vulnerable object at an unpredictable
moment (patch 4/6).

So I think the control over the time of the use-after-free access doesn't help
attackers, if they don't have an "infinite spray" -- unlimited ability to store
controlled data in the kernelspace objects of the needed size without freeing them.

"Unlimited", because the quarantine size is 1/32 of whole memory.
"Without freeing", because freed objects are erased by init_on_free before going
to randomized heap quarantine (patch 3/6).

Would you agree?

Freed objects are filled by zero before going to quarantine (patch 3/6).
Would it cause a null pointer dereference on unsuccessful try?

As I wrote above, I think attacker's control over this timing is required for a
successful attack, but is not enough for bypassing randomized quarantine.

Yes, of course, I didn't mean a "predetermined memory address".
Maybe "definite memory location" is a better phrase for that.

Yes. That behaviour is fast, however very convenient for use-after-free
exploitation...

Yes. The original quarantine size is
  (totalram_pages() << PAGE_SHIFT) / QUARANTINE_FRACTION
where
  #define QUARANTINE_FRACTION 32

Not sure about this probability evaluation.
I will try calculating it taking the quarantine parameters into account.

Right, I agree.

It's a probabilistic protection, and the probability should be calculated.
I'll work on that.

That's interesting, thank you.
