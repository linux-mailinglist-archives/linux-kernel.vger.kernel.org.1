Yeah, I really meant "string description". Also I'll be putting the
key identifier in the superblock so this mount option will be going
away.

I was relying on the validate_checkpoint() to fail when it tries to
verify the checkpoint checksum if an incorrect key is provided, but that
does sound bad to rely on from a design perspective. I'll do what you
mentioned below.

I think we'd first need to get the direct I/O with fscrypt via
blk-crypto patches in (i.e. the patch series at

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20200724184501.1651378-1-satyat@google.com/
)

At least for single device filesystems, it shouldn't be much extra work to
support metadata encryption with the above patch in, especially once I make
fscrypt_set_bio_crypt_ctx() handle setting both the metadata encryption
and file encryption keys as you suggested in the previous patch - For
multi device filesystems, we'd need the offset of the block from the
start of the FS rather than offset of the block from the start of the
device that block belongs to (through my cursory glance at
dio_bio_alloc() where the above patch calls fscrypt_set_bio_crypt_ctx(),
I can see that the latter is readily available as first_sector, but I'm
not sure about the former - I'd imagine we can get that from the
dio->inode or something like that, or maybe some extra plumbing is
required).
