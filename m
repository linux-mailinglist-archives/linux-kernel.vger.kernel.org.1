Thanks for comments, Alex.

the func compact_unlock_should_abort should be removed since one of parameters
changed from 'bool *locked' to 'struct lruvec *lruvec'. So it's not applicable
now. I have to open it here instead of adding a only one user func.

I am wondering if people like a patch which just open compact_unlock_should_abort
func and move bool to void as a preparation patch, do you like this?

The pageblock is aligned by pfn, so pages in them maynot on same memcg
originally. and yes, page may be changed memcg also.

when we change to lruvec->lru_lock, it does the same thing as pgdat->lru_lock.
just may get a bit more chance to here, and find out this is a skipable
pageblock and quit. 
Yes, logically, pgdat lru_lock seems better, but since we are holding lru_lock.
It's fine to not bother more locks.

A code here since some bugs happened. I will check it again anyway.

Thanks!
