I was more concerned about the case where you decide to writeably map (i.e.
wp_page_reuse() path) a PageKsm() page. That path does not touch
page->mapping in your code AFAICS. And AFAIU the code in mm/ksm.c you are
not supposed to writeably map PageKsm() pages without changing
page->mapping (which also effectively makes PageKsm() return false) but I
don't see anything in your code that would achieve that because KSM code
references a page without being accounted in page_count() for $reasons (see
comment before get_ksm_page()) and instead plays tricks with validating
cookies in page->mapping...

And also here I was more concerned that page_mapcount != 1 || page_count !=
1 check could be actually a weaker check than what reuse_swap_page() does.
So the old code could decide to copy while your new code would decide to go
the wp_page_reuse() path. And for this case I don't see how your "but unmap
path is simple" argument would apply...
