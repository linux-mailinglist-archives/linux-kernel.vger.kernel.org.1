Hi Doug, thank you for the fix.

There are multiple usleep in the probe of rt5682 driver.
The major one is a 300 ms sleep after the regulator turns on.
There are other sleeps for several tens of ms.

Agree.
soc-core already handled this by returning -EPROBE_DEFER when a
component is not found.
So the machine driver can probe again.
Even in the current behavior, we already see machine driver probe
again when the codec driver is not ready,
so I think adding this async flag will not affect the machine driver.

One thing I am wondering is that there has not been any usage in codec
driver for this.
I think every codec driver can use this, and take the benefit of a
possible faster boot time ?
