It looks like you've got just two devices, only one of which is in use, 
on bus 1 (the non-SuperSpeed bus) and nothing on bus 2.

The interesting files are 1u (for bus 1) and 2u (for bus 2).  At the 
moment, though, we don't know which bus the troublesome 
device/controller is on.

Do:

	sudo echo 'module usbcore =p' >/debug/dynamic_debug/control

Then wait long enough for some interesting messages to appear in the 
kernel log (it should only take a few seconds if the worker thread is as 
busy as you say) and collect the output from the dmesg command.

To turn dynamic debugging back off when you're finished, use the same 
command with "=p" changed to "-p".
