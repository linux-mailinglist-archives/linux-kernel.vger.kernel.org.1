Subject: [PATCH v5 00/10] Introduce features and debugfs/sysfs entries for MHI
Date:   Thu, 23 Jul 2020 15:36:32 -0700
Message-Id: <1595543802-17859-1-git-send-email-bbhatt@codeaurora.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Save hardware information from BHI.
Allow reading and modifying some MHI variables for debug, test, and
informational purposes using debugfs.
Read values for device specific hardware information to be used by OEMs in
factory testing such as serial number and PK hash using sysfs.

This set of patches was tested on arm64 and x86.

v5:
-Removed the debug entry to trigger reset and will be addressed in a seperate
patch
-Added patch bus: mhi: core: Use counters to track MHI device state transitions
-Updated helper API to trigger a non-blocking host resume
-Minor nitpicks also fixed

v4:
-Removed bus: mhi: core: Introduce independent voting mechanism patch
-Removed bus vote function from debugfs due to independent voting removal
-Added helper resume APIs to aid consolidation of spread out code
-Added a clean-up patch and a missing host resume in voting API

v3:
-Add patch to check for pending packets in suspend as a dependency for the
independent voting mechanism introduction
-Include register dump entry for debugfs to dump MHI, BHI, and BHIe registers
-Update commit message for the debugfs patch
-Updated Documentation/ABI with the required info for sysfs
-Updated debugfs patch to include a new KConfig entry and dependencies
-Updated reviewed-by for some patches

v2:
-Added a new debugfs.c file for specific debugfs entries and code
-Updated commit text and addressed some comments for voting change
-Made sure sysfs is only used for serial number and OEM PK hash usage

Bhaumik Bhatt (10):
  bus: mhi: core: Remove double occurrence for mhi_ctrl_ev_task()
    declaration
  bus: mhi: core: Abort suspends due to outgoing pending packets
  bus: mhi: core: Use helper API to trigger a non-blocking host resume
  bus: mhi: core: Trigger host resume if suspended during
    mhi_device_get()
  bus: mhi: core: Use generic name field for an MHI device
  bus: mhi: core: Introduce helper function to check device state
  bus: mhi: core: Introduce debugfs entries for MHI
  bus: mhi: core: Use counters to track MHI device state transitions
  bus: mhi: core: Read and save device hardware information from BHI
  bus: mhi: core: Introduce sysfs entries for MHI
