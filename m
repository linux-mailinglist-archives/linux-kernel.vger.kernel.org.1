The driver has no provisions for implementing cryptographically based
SGX policy management of any type.

Our stack is extremely lightweight with no external dependencies and
is used in privacy and security sensitive applications, including
financial services of certain types.  There is a desire in this, and
other venues, to use cloud and edge resources with a strong guarantee
that the platforms have only had a known set of behaviors.  The
current DAC based controls in the driver are insufficient to provide
those guarantees.

I believe I have discussed our use of SGX previously.  In a nutshell,
we use SGX based modeling engines to supervise kernel based behavioral
namespaces, one enclave per namespace.  The closest equivalent work
that we have seen may be the IPE architecture advanced by Deven Bowers
at Microsoft but we address a number of issues that work does not,
including non-kernel based behavioral supervision.

We support the concern over hardware locked platforms and do not
disagree with the driver not supporting those platforms.  That being
said, there is no technical rationale for not providing cryptographic
policy management on FLC based platforms, as I believe our patch
demonstrates.

Best wishes for a productive week.
