Interesting idea. It might be a way how to add optional metadata
without breaking compatibility with crashdump tools.

Well, I have bad feeling about it. Some of the reasons might be:

  + would take more space (prefix + text vs. binary representation)
  + not reliable because dict is currently dropped when no space
  + it would make the controversial dictionary feature more important


I would prefer to solve this by storing the timestamps in the
structure with metadata.
