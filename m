trace point, eBPF and other hook technologies are better for production
environments. But for pure debugging work, adding hook points feels a bit
heavy. However, your suggestion is very valuable, thank you very much.

We only do this in the test environment, mainly to facilitate debugging.
We will dynamically adjust the log level, sometimes it is 1, sometimes
higher. There are two main reasons for multiple disks working at the same
time. The first is that the system management tool will update the system
disk, and the second is that the collaborative task will update other
disks. During the actual debugging, we added more additional logs. The
original logs of the system are useful, but some logs don't feel very
meaningful. Thanks.
