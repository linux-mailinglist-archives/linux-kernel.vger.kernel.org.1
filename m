Thanks I've missed this point, I will call debug_locks_off() before
the first call to console_flush_on_panic(CONSOLE_FLUSH_PENDING);

I understand that there is a risk here, and the __crash_exec() call is
not supposed to return when crashexec is ready. This is our last chance
here to push to the console the pending messages.

I agree, this is a risk. But what we see is that even the message
previously submitted by the pr_emerg() call of the panic thread is
currently discarded when __crash_kexec(NULL) is called.
In the case described here, no other message is printed out by a
secondary CPU, but I understand that it could happen, and we
could avoid calling panic_flush_to_console() when kexec_crash isn't
loaded so that we can wait for the SMP stop and leave the current
steps to run untouched until the last printed messages.

Here, we are supposed to push the pending messages, as I could verify
that they don't reach the console until the console_unblank(). So I
wanted to push them with panic_flush_to_console() before the possible
upcoming __crash_kexec() call.

Are you suggesting that I should leave the printk_safe_flush_on_panic()
call before the kmsg_dump(KMSG_DUMP_PANIC) call ?
But let's leave that untouched too.

I've tried your suggestion, and even with this sema_init() call, the
  pr_emerg("Rebooting in %d seconds..\n", panic_timeout);
message is not printed to the console without a subsequent call to
panic_flush_to_console().

See below a code modification that would illustrate a possible change
including the above comments. Would something like that be more
appropriate ?

This is the end of this running kernel, and panic is called from the NMI
context where printk() messages have to be pushed. The mechanism I use
seems to work in this case, but there could be another way to achieve
this goal (?)

Thanks again for your help,
William.
