Just to be clear, I'm not suggesting to add any in-kernel toggling of
uclamp outside of the scheduler: by keeping that to the internal sched
header & schedutil, we're keeping it contained to internal scheduler land.

Since a diff is worth a thousand words, here's what I was thinking of (not
even compiled):

True; and they'll have to go through another path anyway once the unexport
thing happens.

Say if we end up adding static key checks in some other uclamp functions
(which are called in the TG update) and don't change this here, someone
will have to scratch their heads to figure out the key enablement needs to
be moved one line higher. It's harmless future-proofing, I think.
