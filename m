This interface is simply _horrible_ and I do not see a point in this feature!!!

I as a normal dynamic debug user am interested into:

   + enabling/disabling messages from a given module/file/line/function
   + list of available modules/files/lines/functions
   + list of enabled modules/files/lines/functions

I do not understand why I would ever want to do something like:

   + enable messages that print module name and line number
   + disable message that does not print a module name

In fact, IMHO, all the 'flmt' flags were a wrong idea and nobody
really needed them. This information in not needed by other
printk() messages. Why pr_debug() would need them?
They just made the code and interface complicated.

Please, stop all this non-sense!!!

Best Regards,
Petr
