Right, this is what I thought, but Ming reminded me 
"blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter() can be run on another request queue just
between one driver tag is allocated and updating the request map, so one
extra request reference still can be grabbed."

We understand it, and I'll describe my experiment in detail:
a. fio runs on 2x disks, sda (root partition disk) and sdb.
b. for sda, userpace triggers blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter(), as in 
stackframe above. Since its request queue is not frozen, it will iter 
the busy tags.
c. on sdb, I continuously change the IO scheduler.

So sdb request queue gets frozen as we switch IO sched, but we could 
have this sequence of events:
- blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter() on sda takes reference to a sdb request
    - Getting a tag and updating ->rqs[] in tagset is not atomic
- requests for sdb cleared in tagset and request memory is freed
- blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter() on sda still holds reference to sdb 
request and dereferences it -> UAF

Hope it's clear. It is a bit unlikely, I will admit, but it still can 
happen and UAF is never good. So please let me know if other idea to solve.

Thanks,
John
