I don't get your concern, or perhaps this is a feature that I had always 
assumed as "normal":

"msg_fits_inqueue(msq, msgsz)" is in the loop, this ensures progress.

The rational is a design decision:

The check for pipeline sending is only done if there would be space to 
store the message in the queue.

I was afraid that performing the pipeline send immediately, without 
checking queue availability, could break apps:

Some messages would arrive immediately (if there is a waiting receiver), 
other messages are stuck forever (since the queue is full).

Initial patch: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/10/3/5 (without any remarks 
about the design decision)

The risk that I had seen was theoretical, I do not have any real bug 
reports. So we could change it.

Perhaps: Go in the same direction as it was done for POSIX mqueue: 
implement pipelined receive.
