The situation would back to relock scheme, the lru_lock will compete with 
the some root_memcg->lru_lock in practical. So no needs to distinguish 
putback, compaction etc. 

But I don't know how much impact on this alloc path...

compaction:				generic_file_buffered_read:
 					page_cache_alloc()

 !PageBuddy()

 lock_page_lruvec(page)
   lruvec = mem_cgroup_page_lruvec()
   spin_lock(&lruvec->lru_lock)
   if lruvec != mem_cgroup_page_lruvec()
     goto again

 					add_to_page_cache_lru()
 					  mem_cgroup_commit_charge()
					    spin_lock_irq(page->memcg->lruvec->lru_lock)
 					    page->mem_cgroup = foo
					    spin_unlock_irq(page->memcg->lruvec->lru_lock)
 					  lru_cache_add()
 					    __pagevec_lru_add()
 					      SetPageLRU()

 if PageLRU(page):
   __isolate_lru_page()

Yes, this is the problem I encountered now for mem_cgroup_lru_size incorrect.

Yes, we didn't figure a good usage on MEMCG_SWAP too. And if swaping happens
often, the different memcg's memory were swaped to same disk and mixed together
which cause readahead useless.

Sorry for not follow you up, did you mean just remove the MEMCG_SWAP configuration
and keep the feature in default memcg? 
That does can remove lrucare, but PageLRU lock scheme still fails since
we can not isolate the page during commit_charge, is that right?

Thanks a lot!
