Sure.  Looking at the places where tcs_lock() is used:

rpmh_rsc_write_ctrl_data() - only called from flushing routines which
have to have their own exclusion anyway
tcs_write() - holds drv->lock for almost the same amount of time

...so yeah, I can make that change as part of my series and it seems
sane.  Looking at it closely I think in tcs_write() I can still drop
the "drv->lock" before the __tcs_buffer_write() and
__tcs_set_trigger() calls.  That's because I already claimed the TCS
(under lock) by setting "tcs_in_use".  Once I've done that I know
nobody else could be writing to the TCS, right?

Thanks.  The spacebar on my work-from-home keyboard isn't perfect.

I thought about doing stuff like this but decided against it.  It's
adding extra code to solve a problem that (I'll argue) isn't a
problem.  Specifically I believe that I believe it will be exceedingly
rare for _any_ of the "NOTIFY_BAD" cases to hit.  In that super rare
case we do hit one we will still be correct (we won't crash), one CPU
just won't go idle.  I would also argue that (perhaps) if it looked
like the system was idle enough for all the CPUs to go down and then
suddenly one CPU woke up then perhaps it's actually the correct thing
for this CPU not to go idle and to force the system to try again.

To answer whether adding this code would be worth it (and would help
or hurt), it would be interesting to test what's happening on real
systems.  Are you able to hit these "NOTIFY_BAD" cases?  If so, which
ones do you actually hit?  Do you _ever_ hit the case where one of the
spinlocks fails to lock?


I'll await your response here before sending v3.
