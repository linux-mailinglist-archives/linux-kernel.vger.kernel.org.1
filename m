IIUC this is not what Robin proposes.

The idea is to only have one DMA pool, located in ZONE_DMA, if enabled, and
ZONE_DMA32 otherwise. This way you're always sure the memory is going to be
good enough for any device while maintaining the benefits of
atomic_pool_kernel.

I suspect I don't have enough perspective here but, isn't that breaking the
point of having an atomic pool? Wouldn't that generate big latency spikes? =
I
can see how audio transfers over USB could be affected by this specifically=
,
IIRC those are allocated atomically and have timing constraints.

That said, if Robin solution works for you, I don't mind having a go at it.

Nicolas
