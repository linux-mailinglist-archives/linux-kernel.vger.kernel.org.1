To be honest, I saw that as being the way forward for the page cache APIs.
If we're going to use a batching mechanism, it should be pagevecs, and
it should be built into the page cache interfaces rather than hanging
out off on the side.

I was thinking about this some more [1] [2].  I think we can get to the
point where find_get_pages(), find_get_entries() and find_get_pages_tag()
(and all their variants) end up taking a pagevec as their last argument.

Also, I was thinking that all these names are wrong.  Really, they're
mapping_get_pages(), mapping_get_entries() and mapping_get_marked_pages().
So maybe I should move in that direction.
