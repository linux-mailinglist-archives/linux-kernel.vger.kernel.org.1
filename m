wq owns the ultimate or permanent references to itself by
owning references to wq->numa_pwq_tbl[node], wq->dfl_pwq.
The pwq's references keep the pwq in wq->pwqs.

Only destroy_workqueue() can release these ultimate references
and then (after maybe a period of time) deplete the wq->pwqs
finally and then free itself in rcu callback.

Actually, in short, we don't need the care about the above
detail. The responsibility to free rescuer is on
destroy_workqueue(), and since it does the free early,
it doesn't need to do it again later.

e2dca7adff8f moved the free of rescuer into rcu callback,
and I didn't check all the changes between then and now.
But at least now, the rescuer is not accessed in rcu mananer,
so we don't need to free it in rcu mananer.
