I don't follow. When CPU0 is hotplguged back in it'll follow the
secondary boot path, so it can be rejected as with any other secondary
CPU.

If I'm missing a case, could you please point that out more
specifically?

The reason is so that we can log the values for comparison. Otherwise
we'll have to choose some arbitrary CPU's value in order to do so.

I think that practically this means we should leave this as-is. If we
need to keep it around for CPU, then we may as well keep it around and
use it consitently for all secondary CPUs.

I'd prefer to leave this as-is given it's simple to reason about.

Thanks,
Mark.
