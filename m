Hi Paul

There was quite a bit of discussion about this when the first board
was added. If i remember correctly, it was Mamba.

Imre Kaloz, <kaloz@openwrt.org> was the one arguing for
the name armada-xp-linksys-mamba.dts.

So it seems that openwrt.org has now come full circle?

I've no problems adding another compatible to the list. But i don't
like the idea of renaming the files. The file names could be
considered ABI! What installers/bootloaders are you going to break by
renaming them?
