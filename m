Thanks for adding all interested parties.

OK

Agreed, I added for RxTx buffers and initially to build the parent/child
hierarchy for all users of the driver. Initially I was assuming only
in-kernel users and now I agree we should avoid any in kernel users if
possible.

One thing to note FFA_PARTITION_INFO_GET relies on Rx buffers to send the
information to the caller. So we need to have established buffers before
that and one of the reason you don't find that in this RFC. I dropped that
too which I wanted initially.

OK, IIUC that covers mostly KVM implementation. We still need a way to
share the RxTx buffer info to the partitions and DT/ACPI(?) is one
possible way. Based on you comment about not needing DT node, do you have
any other way to communicate the buffer info to the partitions ?

Sounds more fun.

Ah good, so we can still manage in-kernel users this way but we need to
provide interface to such a driver which I agree that we need to avoid
if possible.

Agreed.

I am confused a bit. When you refer drivers above, are you referring to
drivers in host kernel(hypervisor) or in the partitions. I fail to
imagine need for the former.

I am not sure if I am aligned with your thoughts on the buffer sharing
yet.
