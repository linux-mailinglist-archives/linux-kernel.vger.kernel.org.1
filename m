- Just like some media documents, this file is dual licensed
  with GPL and GFDL. As right now the GFDL SPDX definition is
  bogus (as it doesn't tell anything about invariant parts),
  let's not use SPDX here. Let's use, instead, the same test
  as we have on media.
- Convert title to ReST format;
- use :field:  markup;
- Proper mark literal blocks as such;
- Add it to trace/index.rst file.

 Since the cmpxchg returns the old value of the pointer the first writer
 will see it succeeded in updating the pointer from NORMAL to HEAD.
 But as we can see, this is not good enough. It must also check to see
-if the tail page is either where it use to be or on the next page:

 If tail page != A and tail page != B, then it must reset the pointer
 back to NORMAL. The fact that it only needs to worry about nested
-writers means that it only needs to check this after setting the HEAD page.

 Now the writer can update the head page. This is also why the head page must
 remain in UPDATE and only reset by the outermost writer. This prevents
