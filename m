My commit message was misleading, sorry. For SoundWire, we recently 
added new files with GPL-2.0-only (master + sysfs), as recommended since 
the short GPL-2.0 identifier is deprecated 
(https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html https://spdx.org/licenses/).

Intel does not mind if we delay this change, you are right that this 
doesn't change anything license-wise. I just felt it was a good time to 
align old and new contributions to avoid having half of the files with 
GPL-2.0 and half with GPL-2.0-only.

We still have quite a few patches for SoundWire (~80 coming w/ 7k lines 
changed), so those changes are really minimal in comparison with the 
actual 'churn' to fix programming sequences, power management, 
multi-link management and bit allocation.

Oh and this was not intended to be added to 5.8 btw or pulled as a fix, 
really nothing to do with the merge window.

If you prefer us to keep this change on the back burner, that's fine, 
the only intent was to keep all SoundWire-related files consistent.
