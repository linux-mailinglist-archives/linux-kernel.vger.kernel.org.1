These callbacks were added primarily in preparation for the TI K3 rproc 
drivers, not just ST (the patch was resurrected from a very old patch 
from Loic).

I still think prepare/unprepare is actually better suited to scale well 
for the long term. This pm_runtime logic will now make the early-boot 
scenarios complicated, as you would have to match its status, but all 
actual operations are on the actual parent remoteproc platform device 
and not the child remoteproc device. I think it serves to mess up the 
state-machines of different platform drivers due to additional refcounts 
acquired and maybe performing some operations out of sequence to what a 
platform driver wants esp. if there is automated backend usage like 
genpd, pm_clks etc. I am yet to review Mathieu's latest MCU sync series, 
but the concept of different sync_ops already scales w.r.t the 
prepare/unprepare.

As for my K3 drivers, the callbacks are doing more than just turning on 
clocks, as the R5Fs in general as a complex power-on sequence. I do not 
have remoteproc auto-suspend atm on the K3 drivers, but that typically 
means shutting down and restoring the core and would involve all the 
hardware-specific sequences, so the rpm callback implementations will be 
more than just clocks.

I looked through the patch history on the Ingenic remoteproc driver, and 
the only reason for either of runtime pm usage or prepare/unprepare ops 
usage is to ensure that clocks do not stay enabled in the case the 
processor is not loaded/started. The driver is using auto-boot, so when 
it probes, in general we expect the remoteproc to be running. So, the 
only failure case is if there is no firmware. Otherwise, Paul could have 
just used clk_bulk API in probe and remove.

Anyway, I will provide some additional review comments on the pm_runtime 
usage within the Ingenic rproc driver.

Suman
