Sorry I wasn't clear, overall my concern here is that xhic-pci maintainers,
both in u-boot y linux (as I'd like to have the same solution on both sides=
,
since it involves changes in dt), might see it as too platform specific to =
add
it into an otherwise generic xhci-pci implmentation.

But nevermind, I'll just post the series and see what happens :).
