Glad you like it!  And I hope that it helps!

One usability concern is whether rcutree.rcu_unlock_delay needs to be
applied only some small fraction of the time in order to allow the delay
to be large (a couple hundred microseconds?)  while still avoiding doing
too much more damage to timing and performance than absolutely necessary.

It looks like you are correct, and that the first parameter can be
dropped, the "if" you mention replaced by a WARN_ON_ONCE(), and
the body of that "if" be unconditional.  I have it on my list, and
if it still looks correct in the cold hard light of dawn, I will
apply it with your Reported-by.

And thank you very much for looking it over!

						Thanx, Paul
