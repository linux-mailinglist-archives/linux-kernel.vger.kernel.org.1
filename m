Right (note that I already have an implementation of my range lock
('B') along these lines, with a low-level lock ('A') tucked into it
and all the expected lockdep support).

My issue is that I have other data, unrelated to B, which frequently
needs to be accessed or updated at just the same points where we are
acquiring or releasing B.

(to go into use cases: that data would be the vma rbtree and per-MM
statistics; one may want to find a free gap between vmas before range
locking it, or take vmas in and out of the rbtree as we acquire or
release a lock on the corresponding address range, etc...)

As the accesses to that data tend to naturally align with the places
where we take or release the B lock, it is tempting to expose A to the
caller so that A can protect additional data not directly related to
B. It seems like changing B's internal lock into a public one which
the caller would take and release explicitly around B calls would be
straighforward, but it causes issues as lockdep doesn't understand
that construct...
