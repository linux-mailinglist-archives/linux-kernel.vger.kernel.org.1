I could make a default as you suggested to include i2c address and bus 
in the name.  But the TAS2563 does not need the firmware to operate and 
the 2562 does not have a DSP.

What if there was an ALSA control instead that passed in the firmware 
name from the user space instead of using the DT?

Then the control can load and parse the firmware and wait for the user 
to select the program.

This would solve a user from having ot update the DT to use a firmware.
