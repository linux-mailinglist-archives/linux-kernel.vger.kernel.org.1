Ah, I see. I had only noticed the architecture specific overrides for
__crc32c_le(),
and the global __weak crc32_le() function in lib/crc32.c, but failed to notice
the crc32c_le() macro that redirects to crc32c().

The per-architecture overrides for __crc32c_le() are from 2018. With that
it should be possible to just always have the fastest implementation
(forcing them to be built-in normally), but not all architectures do this.

I recently made checked the missing dependencies of drivers that
fail to 'select CRC32' but do call it directly. With those added, there
are now around 200 drivers that include it, and in practice you would
hardly find any kernel that doesn't have it built-in already. Most notably,
jbd2 already calls crc32_be(), so it is impossible to build an EXT4
without it. For memory-constrained embedded devices, it would probably
be more valuable to build without the crypto layer than without crc32.
