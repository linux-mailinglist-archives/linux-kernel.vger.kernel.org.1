Given the `vcpu` argument has been removed, it's odd to keep `vcpu` in the
name, rather than `esr`.

e.g. this would make more sense as something like esr_get_condition().

... and if we did something like that, we could move most of the
extraction functions into <asm/esr.h>, and share them with non-KVM code.

Otherwise, do you need to extract all of these for your use-case, or do
you only need a few of the helpers? If you only need a few, it might be
better to only factor those out for now, and keep the existing API in
place with wrappers, e.g. have:

| esr_get_condition(u32 esr) {
| 	... 
| }
| 
| kvm_vcpu_get_condition(const struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
| {
| 	return esr_get_condition(kvm_vcpu_get_esr(vcpu));
| }

Thanks,
Mark.
