Sure, it deserves a better comment. I will add something like :

	/*
	 * We don't track input connection details for a device,
	 * except for the highest input port number. Thus we could
	 * reuse the current record as a scratch pad and reuse it
	 * by not moving the ptr ahead.
	 */

Thanks for the heads up, will do.
