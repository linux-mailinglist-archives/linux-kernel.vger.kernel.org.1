As I stated, runtime PM isn't solely about clock gating. It depends on the SoC.

For example, if this sdhci device is being powered by a shared voltage
rail through a PM domain, perhaps it's even critical from an energy
efficiency point to manage runtime PM correctly.

By looking at the original commit, that sounds exactly what is
happening as the registers seem to lose their context.

Alright. Then perhaps you need parts of what
sdhci_runtime_suspend|resume() is doing?

Anyway, as I said below. If you really have some good reasons from an
energy efficiency point of view, you can always disable runtime
suspend, along the lines of below.

To put it clear, to me the reasons you are providing to justify the
revert just doesn't make sense. Please try a different option.
