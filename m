Well, those activities generally try to unmap the page, and
have to be prepared to deal with failure to unmap. From my reading,
it seemed very clear.

What's less clear is why the comment and the commit description
only talk about reclaim, when there are additional things that call
try_to_unmap(), including:

     migrate_vma_unmap()
     split_huge_page_to_list() --> unmap_page()

I do like this code change, though. And I *think* it's actually safe to
do this, as it stays away from writeback or other filesystem activity.
But let me double check that, in case I'm forgetting something.

thanks,
