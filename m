You mean xconfig/qconf? (gconf is another program that is GTK based as far as I know).

Could you expalin though what was broken? What exactly didn't work?
I do seem to be able to select menus on the left and the config items to the right,
change the config item values, etc, in the split mode at least with these commits reverted.

Could you check that you also have the issue with search in qconf/xconfig?

Thank you!
It does work for me as well (except using qconf of course).
