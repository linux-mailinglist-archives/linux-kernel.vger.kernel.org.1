I have no idea why it happen this way.
during debug 
https://partnerissuetracker.corp.google.com/issues/170598152
I saw two different scenario
1) irq_hpd followed by unplug with less than 20 ms in between. this one 
fixed by this patch set.
2) plug followed by irq_hpd around 300ms in between. it does not cause 
problem. but it should be handled in order (after connected state).
