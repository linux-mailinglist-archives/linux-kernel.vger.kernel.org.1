Uh wut.

So the merge criteria for drivers/accel (atm still drivers/misc but I
thought that was interim until more drivers showed up) isn't actually
"totally-not-a-gpu accel driver without open source userspace".

Instead it's "totally-not-a-gpu accel driver without open source
userspace" _and_ you have to be best buddies with Greg. Or at least
not be on the naughty company list. Since for habanalabs all you
wanted is a few test cases to exercise the ioctls. Not the entire
userspace.

The most bonkers part here is that drivers/gpu actually does have a bunch
of active contributors from codeaurora ...

So you couldn't review the habanalabs driver either?

Get some consistency into your decision making as maintainer. And don't
tell me or anyone else that this is complicated, gpu and rdma driver folks
very much told you and Olof last year that this is what you're getting
yourself into.

Cheers, Daniel

PS: I guess congrats for figuring out you can't write a totally-not-a-gpu
accel driver without making kernel and userspace parts derivatives works
of each another. We told you that last year.
