I'm not against Android defined interfaces, just be confused about the
behavior that does not fully documented (at least, we should add this
into f2fs doc, and specify this is android specified interface), something
like once one mount point was umounted, that sequential number @x in
'mount_@x" could be reused by later newly mounted point, it breaks the
description: "in the order of mounting filesystem".
