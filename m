I actually followed that process and got the OK to try to upstream.

I think the issues you identified went uncaught mainly due to the
limited Linux ARM expertise within that group (and Intel in general).

Anyway, I'll keep working with our Linux Kernel people to try to reduce
the burden on you and the other kernel maintainers.

My bad, I didn't consider the issue of multi-platform ARM kernels.

The problem is that I need this code to be run early at boot, so I
don't think I can make this a module.

But I'm sure there is a proper way to achieve what I need without
breaking multi-system kernels. I'll do my homework and try to find it.
