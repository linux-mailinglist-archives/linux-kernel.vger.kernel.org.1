This like any other user visible interface would be a much easier sell
if there was a clear usecase to justify it. I do not see anything
controversial about exporting such a value but my general take is that
we are only adding new interface when existing ones are insufficient. A
performance might be a very good reason but that would really require to
come with some real life numbers.
