That's right - although it's behind the static_call API that the patch
depends on ([5] in the original mail).

Sure, sorry - here's the Lore link for future reference:

The switch trick is not really motivated by performance.

I think all the focus on the NOPs themselves is a bit misleading here
- we _can't_ execute the NOPs for the int hooks, because there are
instructions after them that expect a function to have just returned a
value, which NOP doesn't do. When there is a NOP in the slot instead
of a CALL, it would appear to "return" whatever value is leftover in
the return register. At the C level, this is why the static_call API
doesn't allow static_call_cond to return a value (which is what PeterZ
is referring to in the thread I linked above).

So, we could drop the switch trick for void hooks and just use
static_call_cond, but this doesn't work for int hooks. IMO that
variation between the two hook types would just add confusion.

Not sure what you mean here - is there already a macro that does what
UNROLL_MACRO_LOOP does?
