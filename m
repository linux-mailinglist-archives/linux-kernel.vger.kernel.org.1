Just a side note; this RT vs CFS inter-operatability is an issue that
creeps up every now and again.

Does the UI thread in Android ever run as RT by the way? I always suspected it
is one susceptible to such potential delays since it is part of the application
thread and thought it can't be trusted to become RT.

Those 120MHz displays will stress the pipeline :-)

This is a function of num_cpus too. As long as nr_cpus > nr_running_rt_tasks
you should be fine.
