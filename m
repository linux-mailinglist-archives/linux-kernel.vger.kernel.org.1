That is there for debugging and for being able to support things when
the kernel is not updated with a new device id yet.

The virtio people took this to a new extreme and use it to bind real
devices through to virtual machines, but really, that's horrid.  And
they have problems with it as is seen in random patches at times.

Don't make this the only way to support this, that's not an ok api.
