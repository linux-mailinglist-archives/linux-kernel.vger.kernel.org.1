I suspect that in general there is no way to do this properly.

We can't modify ehci-hcd and ohci-hcd to make them wait.  In fact, for 
all they know, xhci-hcd will _never_ be loaded.

One thing that might be possible (although not all platforms may support 
it) is if xhci-hcd could somehow disconnect all devices attached to a 
peer port when it starts up.  But that would be disruptive to any 
devices that aren't USB-3.

We faced a very similar ordering problem between ehci-hcd and 
[ou]hci-hcd many years ago, and we never found a good solution.  
We did arrange the link order so that ehci-hcd precedes the others, and 
we added a warning message to ehci-hcd which gets printed if the module 
initialization routine runs after [ou]hci-hcd is loaded.  Also, there 
are MODULE_SOFTDEP lines in ohci-pci.c and uhci-pci.c.
