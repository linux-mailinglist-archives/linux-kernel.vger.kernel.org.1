So, my thinking was to open code the fixes to minimize the code churn
in the -stable trees and isolate logical changes. However, in looking
at the commits (3.6, 3.8) and the age of the rest of the nearby code in
SCM_RIGHTS (3.7), and the actual oldest supported kernel release (3.16),
I guess it would be better to split it like you've done.

Sorry, I was not writing very clearly: I was meaning to have said:

I was expecting the helper to take the __user pointer (like I thought
we agreed[1]) so we could both avoid changing SCM_RIGHTS behavior and
avoid copy/pasting of the get_unused/put_unused code in 3 places. (I
get into this more in the other thread[2]).

So, let's finalize this decision in the thread at [2]. Again, sorry I
wasted your time due to my confusion!

[1] Apologies, I misread your "1" in [3] to be "suggestion 1" from the
    quoted text from me in that email, rather than the "[1]" it was,
    which was a link to your counter-proposal. And then I wasted your
    time by saying "agreed".
