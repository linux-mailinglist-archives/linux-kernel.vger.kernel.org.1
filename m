I'm not sure what this means. Where is this ARM server group itself
located?

Looking at the TRM, I couldn't see where many of the register field
values were defined, which makes it difficult to review. Which
documentation are you looking at?

Could we please drop the '_OFFSET' suffix? I don't think it's adding
anything, and it makes this more painful to read/write.

Looking at the TRM, this is at offset 0xA08. If this is all relative to
0xA00 there should be a comment to that effect. Similarly, the offsets
below are relative to each counter's group of registers, and we should
comment that.

How about:

/*
 * The PMU registers start at 0xA00 in the DMC-620 memory map, and these
 * offsets are relative to that base.
 *
 * Each counter has a group of control/value registers, and the
 * PMU_COUNTERx offsets are within a counter group.
 *
 * The counter registers groups start at 0xA10.

Can we please write the offsets in hexadecimal? That makes it much
easier to compare with the TRM.

As implied earlier, please use 'COUNTERx' to make it clear that this is
a relative offset within a given counter group.

Please replace DMC620_PMU_COUNTER_REG_BYTE_LENGTH with:

/* Offset of the registers for a given counter, relative to 0xA00 */
#define DMC620_PMU_COUNTERx_OFFSET(x) \
	(DMC620_PMU_COUNTERS_BASE_OFFSET + 0x28 * (x))

... which is a bit clearer here, and will simplify the read/write
functions later.

Which documentation did you get these value from? I couldn't spot them
in the TRM. Likewise for the control register bits, so I fear I'm
missing something obvious.

The 'affinity' naming is a bit cojnfusing, since this really represents
an IRQ. Could we please rename 'affinity' to 'irq', and use 'node' to
distinguish list entries from the list as a whole? i.e.

| static LIST_HEAD(dmc620_pmu_irqs);
| static DEFINE_MUTEX(dmc620_pmu_irqs_lock);
| 
| struct dmc620_pmu_irq {
| 	struct hlist_node node;
| 	struct list_head pmus_list;
| 	struct list_head irqs_node;
| 	refcount_t refcount;
| 	unsigned int irq;
| 	unsigned int cpu;
| }

... and similarly:

|	struct dmc620_pmu_irq *irq;
|	struct list_head pmus_node;

Please rename this to 'events', to match what we do for the CPU PMU.
It's shorter and clearer.

Please make this return a u32, as readl() does.

Please make 'val' a u32, as writel() consumes.

You shouldn't need to cast to u64 here. The compiler can figure out the
type promotion.

This should be:

Thanks,
Mark.
