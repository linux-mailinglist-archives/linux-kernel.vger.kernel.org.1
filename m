The downstream driver is the result of a series of patches, by various
people, whom all use their Signed-off-by to denote that what they add is
conforming to the given license and that they have permission to
contribute to the project.

No, but I think the wording here is wrong. The patch is not taken from
downstream, it's based on downstream code.

It should, in the case that what is contributed is the forwarding of a
patch found somewhere.

But as I said before, Jonathan does through his S-o-b state that his
patch is based on previous work that is covered under appropriate open
source license and that he has the right under that license to
contribute said work.

As such, his patch is meeting the requirements.


The other part is how to give credit to authors of the original work,
Jonathan does that by stating that it's based on work in the downstream
kernel - which is quite typical to how it's done.

No. The author and s-o-b relates to license compliance, as such the
person who committed the auto generated work will sign off that the
content is license compliant and he/she is allowed to contribute it to
the project.
