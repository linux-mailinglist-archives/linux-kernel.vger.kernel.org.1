Why do you think the reclaim target is small? In the case of generating tons of 
dirty pages, current->memcg_nr_pages_over_high can grow to be huge (on the 
order of several tens of megabytes or more).

I'm not sure I agree. Reclaim knows what you asked it to do: reclaim N pages, 
but what to do about the situation when it fails to satisfy that is a job for 
the caller. In this case, we are willing to even tolerate a little bit of 
overage up to the 10ms throttle threshold. In other cases, we want to do other 
checks first before retrying, because the tradeoffs are different. Putting all 
of this inside the reclaim logic seems unwieldy.

It can also get large if a number of subsequent reclaim attempts are making 
progress, but not satisfying demand fully, as is happening here. As a facetious 
example, even if we request N and reclaim can satisfy N-1 each time, eventually 
those single pages can grow to become a non-trivial size.

It's not unbound when there is reclaim progress, it stops when we are within 
the memory.high throttling grace period. Right after reclaim, we check if 
penalty_jiffies is less than 10ms, and abort and further reclaim or allocator 
throttling:

	retry_reclaim:
		nr_reclaimed = reclaim_high(memcg, nr_pages, GFP_KERNEL);

		/*
		 * memory.high is breached and reclaim is unable to keep up. Throttle
		 * allocators proactively to slow down excessive growth.
		 */
		penalty_jiffies = calculate_high_delay(memcg, nr_pages);

		/*
		 * Don't sleep if the amount of jiffies this memcg owes us is so low
		 * that it's not even worth doing, in an attempt to be nice to those who
		 * go only a small amount over their memory.high value and maybe haven't
		 * been aggressively reclaimed enough yet.
		 */
		if (penalty_jiffies <= HZ / 100)
			goto out;

Regardless, you're pushing for different reclaim semantics for memory.high than 
memory.max here, which requires evidence that the current approach taken for 
memory.max is wrong or causing issues. And sure, you can say that that's 
because in memory.max's case we would have a memcg OOM, but again, that's not 
really different from how memory.high is supposed to work: with a userspace OOM 
killer monitoring it and producing OOM kills as necessary.
