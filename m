Thank you both!

I applied the above, with the usual commit-log wordsmithing.

These I folded into the rcutorture commit, as you suggested.

I applied these two.

This one didn't apply, probably due to recent changes in -rcu.  Could
you please take a look?

I do get the occasional rcutorture writer stall in TREE01.  I sent you
the console log offlist, but I suspect that this is related to some
of your questions.  I am retesting with the new TREE01 boot parameters
removed (but with the new rcu_nocbs= layout).  These stalls are temporary,
with torturing progressing normally after the warnings are printed.

This warning usually indicates that grace periods are progressing

I believe that the following enhancements will be needed:

o	Forbid toggling of offlined CPUs.  This is a simple rule that
	results in deterministic success or failure.  The current setup
	(which I freely admit that I suggested) will fail very rarely,
	only if a newly offlined offloaded CPU is toggled before its
	remaining callbacks are invoked.  The current state is therefore
	an accident waiting to happen.

	This will entail fixing a few comments as well.

o	Drain the bypass early in the de-offloading process and prohibit
	queuing onto the bypass anywhere in the toggling process.
	Then the only CPUs permitted to use the bypass are those that
	are fully offloaded.  This approach allows rcu_core() and the
	rcuog kthreads to safely manipulate callbacks and grace periods
	concurrently.  (Famous last words!)  This might address the
	rcutorture writer stall warnings I am seeing.

	This will entail fixing a few comments as well.

o	Avoid double write to rdp->nocb_cb_sleep in nocb_cb_wait().
	Unless there is some reason why this is absolutely required.
	It will cause confusion as it is.

o	What bad thing happens if we de-offload the CPU corresponding to
	the nocb GP kthread?  It does work fine when that CPU is offlined.

	Coincidence or not, all but one of the rcutorture writer stalls
	is followed by a message refusing to de-offload this CPU.

o	The nocb_gp_update_state() function's return value seems backwards.
	What am I missing here?

o	__rcu_nocb_rdp_deoffload(): Why move rcu_nocb_lock_irqsave()
	across a comment?

o	We need better debug.  For example, "Can't deoffload an rdp GP
	leader (yet)".	Well, which CPU?  For another example, we need
	deoffload state in rcutorture writer-stall dumps.

I intend to do the following, and, if feasible, fold them into the
original commits:

o	Make rcu_segcblist_is_offloaded() use "&&" instead of a
	nested "if" statement.

o	nocb_cb_wait() needs the "^^^ Ensure CB invocation follows
	_sleep test" to be adjusted so that it is properly attached to
	its smp_load_acquire().

o	nocb_cb_wait() -- alphabetical order for local variables, please!
	Yeah, I know, others like inverted tree for reasons that escape me
	completely.

							Thanx, Paul
