Sigh, I see that devkmsg_llseek() returns -ESPIPE when offset is not
zero. This is a real mess.

I wonder if we could afford to switch this one to -EINVAL and reduce
the mess.

Anyway, for a random reader, it might be pretty unclear what is
exactly special about /dev/kmsg. I wonder if the following might
be more explanatory and strightforward:

		Other seek operations or offsets are not supported because of
		the special behavior. The device allows to read or write
		only whole variable lenght messages that are stored in
		a ring buffer.

		Because of the non-standard behavior also the error values
		are non-standardand. -ESPIPE is returned for non-zero offset.
		-EINVAL is returned for other operations, e.g. SEEK_CUR.
		This behavior is historical and could not be modified
		wihtout the risk of breaking userspace.


Finally, only few people read documentation. We should add some
warning also to the code. I think about a something like:

/*
 * Be careful when modifying this function!!!
 *
 * Only few operations are supported because the device works only with
 * the entire variable length messages. Non-standard error values are
 * returned in the other cases. User space applications might depend
 * on this behavior.
 */
