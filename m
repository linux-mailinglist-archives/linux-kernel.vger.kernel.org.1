I agree that w/ IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING=y rt_rq->rt_time isn't high enough
in this testcase.

stress-ng-hrtim-1655 [001] 462.897733: bprint: update_curr_rt:
rt_rq->rt_time=416716900 rt_rq->rt_runtime=950000000
rt_b->rt_runtime=950000000

The 5% reservation (1 - sched_rt_runtime_us/sched_rt_period_us) for CFS
is massively eclipsed by irqtime.

It's true that avg_irq tracks 'irq_delta + steal' time but it is meant
to potentially reduce cpu capacity. It's also cpu and frequency
invariant (your CPU2 is a big CPU so no issue here).

Could a rq_clock(rq) derived rt_rq signal been used to compare against
rt_runtime?

BTW, DL already influences rt_rq->rt_time.
