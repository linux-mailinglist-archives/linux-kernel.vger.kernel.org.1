Can you explain a bit more? I don't see any requirement of having a
layer of cgroup between root and the job cgroup. Internally we
schedule jobs as top level cgroups. There do exist jobs which are a
combination of other jobs and there we do use an additional layer of
cgroup (similar to pods running multiple containers in kubernetes).
Surely we can add a layer for all the jobs but it comes with an
overhead and at scale that overhead is not negligible.

Yes, we can set memory.max though it has different oom semantics and
not really a replacement for memory.high.
