Right, and I can see a use case for this if someone has a board that
for some reason didn't physically connect one of the directions for some
reason - perhaps they were running out of pins or something.  It's not
clear if anyone's actually doing that though.

I'm not 100% clear, have we actually found cases where the flags are
used or is this something found through inspection and review?

This was all triggered by Morimoto-san's changes like you say.  DPCM has
quite a lot of problems in general, here IIRC the issues were that we
had multiple different ways of doing similar things which it wasn't
quite clear if people were even using.  The intention with the warnings
was to remove them one way or another, they're mainly intended to flush
out actual active usage of the flags as opposed to redundant usage of
them which could be confused/broken.

This could definitely have been clearer in the changelogs though.
