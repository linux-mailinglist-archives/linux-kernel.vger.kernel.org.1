Yes, will do. I had left it out mistakenly thinking it would help
focus the discussion, but the replacements don't make sense without
including the replacements for whitelist.

Yes.

Yes, I'll at least expand this with the paired terminology for each of
the replacements of 'slave'.

That makes practical sense to me. Now that I look at this I think the
recommendation for the shorthand replacement should only be one style
option, lets say "blocklist/passlist" because it's not as amenable to
context sensitive replacements as "slave" and benefits from a standard
single shorthand.

Perhaps. Again, I wanted to stay focused and not dilute the discussion
about the specific terminology at issue with a series of "what about"
debates. I also did not want to specify a threshold for when Linux
would need to deal with an issue like this again. I believe that will
be a case of "we'll know it when we see it". Certainly the terminology
at hand seems to have passed that threshold given multiple
organizations actively discussing and deploying policy to address it.

Sure, I'd be ok with that to move the coding-style change forward.
