Yes, those were among the mails that I read through before getting
down to review.  I was surprised by their not understanding, but
it was a bit late to reply to that thread.

Perhaps everybody had been focused on pages which have been and
naturally belong on an LRU list, rather than pages which are on
the LRU list at the instant that split_huge_page() is called.

There are a number of places where PageLRU gets cleared, and a
number of places where we del_page_from_lru_list(), I think you'll
agree: your patches touch all or most of them.  Let's think of a
common one, isolate_lru_pages() used by page reclaim, but the same
would apply to most of the others.

Then there a number of places where split_huge_page() is called:
I am having difficulty finding any of those which cannot race with
page reclaim, but shall we choose anon THP's deferred_split_scan(),
or shmem THP's shmem_punch_compound()?

What prevents either of those from calling split_huge_page() at
a time when isolate_lru_pages() has removed the page from LRU?

But there's no problem in this race, because anyone isolating the
page from LRU must hold their own reference to the page (to prevent
it from being freed independently), and the can_split_huge_page() or
page_ref_freeze() in split_huge_page_to_list() will detect that and
fail the split with -EBUSY (or else succeed and prevent new references
from being acquired).  So this case never reaches lru_add_page_tail().

Oh, the use of split_huge_page() in __iommu_dma_alloc_pages() is just
nonsense, I thought it had already been removed - perhaps some debate
over __GFP_COMP held it up.  Not something you need worry about in
this patchset.

I did not know that was why you were putting 18/32 in at that
point, it does not mention TestClearPageLRU at all.  But the fact
remains that it's a nice cleanup, contains a reassuring WARN if we
got it wrong (and I've suggested a WARN on the other branch too),
it was valid before your changes, and it's valid after your changes.
Please merge it back into the uglier 05/32, and again I'll rewrite
whatever comment you come up with if necessary.

You say "lru_lock and page cache xa_lock have no reason with current
sequence", but you give no reason for inverting their sequence:
"let's" is not a reason.

> and still no idea of the move_lock in the chain.

memcg->move_lock is what's at the heart of lock_page_memcg(), but
as much as possible that tries to avoid the overhead of actually
taking it, since moving memcg is a rare operation.  For lock ordering,
see the diagram in mm/rmap.c, which 23/32 updates to match this change.

Before this commit: lru_lock > move_lock > i_pages lock was the
expected lock ordering (but it looks as if the lru_lock > move_lock
requirement came from my per-memcg lru_lock patches).

After this commit:  move_lock > i_pages lock > lru_lock is the
required lock ordering, since there are strong reasons (in dirty
writeback) for move_lock > i_pages lock.

Will do, but not before reviewing your remaining patches.

>=20

If I understand your brief comment there, you're saying that
in a fixed interval of time, the baseline 5.9-rc did 100 runs,
the patches up to and including 26/32 did 180 runs, then with
27/32 on top, did 198 runs?

That's a good improvement by 27/32, but not essential for getting
the patchset in: I don't think 27/32 is the right way to do it,
so I'd still prefer to hold it back from the "initial offering".

I imagine all you need is to start off with a
=09for (i =3D pagevec_count(pvec) - 1; i >=3D 0; i--)
loop.
