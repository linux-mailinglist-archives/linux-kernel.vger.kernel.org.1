True enough!

Agreed.

Hah!!!  That is the original ACCESS_ONCE(), isn't it?  ;-)

	ACCESS_ONCE(current->rcu_read_lock_nesting)++;

But open-coding makes sense unless a lot of other places need something
similar.  Besides, open-coding allows me to defer bikeshedding on the
name, given that there are actually two accesses.  :-/

Ah, but that gets compiler warnings:

kernel/rcu/tree_plugin.h:354:52: error: lvalue required as increment operand
  *((volatile int *)&current->rcu_read_lock_nesting)++;

Let's try the old ACCESS_ONCE().  Dialing back to v3.0:

#define ACCESS_ONCE(x) (*(volatile typeof(x) *)&(x))

So:
	(*(volatile int *)&(current->rcu_read_lock_nesting))++;

This gets me the following for __rcu_read_lock():

00000000000000e0 <__rcu_read_lock>:
      e0:	48 8b 14 25 00 00 00 	mov    0x0,%rdx
      e7:	00 
      e8:	8b 82 e0 02 00 00    	mov    0x2e0(%rdx),%eax
      ee:	83 c0 01             	add    $0x1,%eax
      f1:	89 82 e0 02 00 00    	mov    %eax,0x2e0(%rdx)
      f7:	c3                   	retq   
      f8:	0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 	nopl   0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
      ff:	00 

One might hope for a dec instruction, but this isn't bad.  We do lose
a few instructions compared to the C-language case due to differences
in address calculation:

00000000000000e0 <__rcu_read_lock>:
      e0:	48 8b 04 25 00 00 00 	mov    0x0,%rax
      e7:	00 
      e8:	83 80 e0 02 00 00 01 	addl   $0x1,0x2e0(%rax)
      ef:	c3                   	retq   

For the relevant portion of __rcu_read_unlock(), this gets us
the following:

00000000000027f0 <__rcu_read_unlock>:
    27f0:	48 8b 3c 25 00 00 00 	mov    0x0,%rdi
    27f7:	00 
    27f8:	53                   	push   %rbx
    27f9:	8b 87 e0 02 00 00    	mov    0x2e0(%rdi),%eax
    27ff:	8d 50 ff             	lea    -0x1(%rax),%edx
    2802:	85 c0                	test   %eax,%eax
    2804:	89 97 e0 02 00 00    	mov    %edx,0x2e0(%rdi)
    280a:	75 0a                	jne    2816 <__rcu_read_unlock+0x26>

Here we have a load-subtract-store, but given that we need to test
the value, this seems reasonable to me.  We again lose a few instructions
compared to the C-language case, and again due to address calculation:

00000000000027e0 <__rcu_read_unlock>:
    27e0:	53                   	push   %rbx
    27e1:	48 8b 3c 25 00 00 00 	mov    0x0,%rdi
    27e8:	00 
    27e9:	83 af e0 02 00 00 01 	subl   $0x1,0x2e0(%rdi)
    27f0:	75 0a                	jne    27fc <__rcu_read_unlock+0x1c>

Thoughts?

							Thanx, Paul
