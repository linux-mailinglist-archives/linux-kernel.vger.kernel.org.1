If we do need to have a kernel workaround I'm happy to help out, I've
done a bunch of these and occasionally it's good to get rather
creative :-)

Ideally we'd also push a minimal fix in userspace to all stable
branches and make sure distros upgrade (might need releases if some
distro is stuck on old horrors), so that we don't have to keep the
hack in place for 10+ years or so. Definitely if the hack amounts to
disabling modifiers on nouveau, that would be kinda sad.
