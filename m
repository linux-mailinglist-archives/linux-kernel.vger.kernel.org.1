Thanks Kees.

I don't think there is a huge difference of opinion here, and I hope I
managed to strike the right tone, which was not meant to be a grumpy
one.

To reiterate my point: I strongly prefer minor asm surgery over
elaborate Kconfig plumbing if it means we can retain the functionality
even when using LLVM tools. In particular, the use of macros to
implement missing ISA support should be considered before any other
solution, as these are already being used widely across architectures
to fill in such gaps.

This code has been around since 2004. It has never been possible to
assemble it with Clang's assembler. So the only thing this patch gives
you is the ability to switch from a .config where IWMMXT was disabled
by hand to one where it gets disabled automatically by Kconfig.

So what hard-won ground are we losing here? Did IWMMXT recently get
enabled in a defconfig that you care about?

I am not disagreeing with you here, and I have worked with Nick,
Nathan and Stefan on numerous occasions to get Clang related build
issues solved.
