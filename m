Hmm I thought OEMs who ship stuff that are based on Chrome OS would have to do
the final tuning here, which would be based on the recommendation of the SoC
vendor. And I'm being overly generic here to think not only SoC from Intel
which traditionally they have been treated in different ways.

I think you provide a generic stack for OEMs, no?

Generally for RT tasks, Linux always required an admin to do the tuning. And to
provide an automatic solution that fits all is not easy to happen, because what
ultimately is important for userspace, is only known by the userspace.

This is an interesting problem for me personally that I have been trying to
look at in my free time. On general purpose systems, it's hard to reason about
what's important because, as you say, you distribute something that should
target a wide range of platforms. And sometimes the end user (like a person
installing Ubuntu Desktop on their laptop), have no clue what a driver is even
to pick the right tuning for all RT tasks in their system.

But this problem already exists and catching up with this will need more work
from both distros and maybe kernel. I can't see a possible situation where the
kernel can do all the tuning without userspace providing more info anyway.

The per-device weirdness you're talking about is just how the way goes in
a world where there are many SoCs that are created to target different budgets
and use cases.

So I don't see the 2 worlds (laptops/mobile) really different, they just
traditionally started differently where such variations in SoC didn't exist
that much. But there are more Arm based SoCs that are targetting laptop markets
now.. So you never know when they will be dealing with the same variations the
mobile world sees today.

I think there are low end laptops in the market that barely have enough grunt
to do work. So not all laptops are fairly powerful.

Apologies for my lack knowledge about the exact process in Chrome OS. In my
head, I think what you do is like what Android and other distros do. Provide
a software stack that can be used on any platform. On Android OEMs do have to
do the tuning (with a help from SoC vendor usually). Not many laptops ship with
Linux as their default OS, but this is an increasing trend and LWN did write
something recently about the demand is increasing for Linux based laptops.


I thought Chrome OS is the same, where an OEM will take your deliverables and
do the final integration.

So I agree at your level it might be hard to reason about the full spectrum.
But I thought the OEMs that wants to ship Chrome OS will need to look at init
scripts, drivers etc to ensure their laptop is competitive.

Yes I appreciate the challenges you have. I think for most users disabling is
good enough for them as RT tasks could end up causing a lot of power to be
wasted unnecessarily. But if someone wants to take the extra mile and squeeze
the best compromise, they can :)
