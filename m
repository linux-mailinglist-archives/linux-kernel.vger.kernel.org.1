I think we can look at the patch as simply expanding the scope of what 
already exists.

The client here has been calling mhi_device_get/put/sync APIs to gain 
device vote and with
new features yet to come in, this introductory change is only 
re-purposing what voting
means going forward. i.e. allowing individual bus and device votes.

If you're suggesting using runtimePM APIs to replace the newly 
introduced bus vote, it
would be kind of overkill here IMO. Is that what you were getting at? 
Because currently,
we just have controllers use runtimePM and provide callbacks to them.

If you have ideas, we can discuss them.
