How so?

The lockdep splat is about this:

 [  735.324154] swapper/3/0 is trying to acquire lock:
 [  735.324155] ffffffff8442c858 ((console_sem).lock){-...}-{2:2}, at: down_trylock+0x13/0x70
 [  735.324162]
 [  735.324164] but task is already holding lock:
 [  735.324165] ffff88842dfb9958 (hrtimer_bases.lock){-.-.}-{2:2}, at: lock_hrtimer_base+0x71/0x120

and the call chain is:

 [  735.324283]        __lock_acquire+0x374a/0x5210
 [  735.324284]        lock_acquire+0x1b9/0x920

 [  735.324309]        secondary_startup_64+0xa4/0xb0

hrtimer_start_range_ns() clearly holds htimer_base::lock

It does not matter whether the timestamps are correct or not. Even if
they are not, then this does not change the fact that this happens on
CPU3 way after the first invocation of __setup_APIC_LVTT() on CPU0 which
simply cannot trigger this splat.

Can you please provide the full dmesg with the splat?

Is that a plain kernel from Linus tree or do you have other patches
applied?

A .config file would be appreciated as well along with information about
the hardware or whatever this runs on.

It's eliminating the symptom, but this does not make the root cause go
away nor does it explain anything.

which is completely unrelated.

Thanks,
