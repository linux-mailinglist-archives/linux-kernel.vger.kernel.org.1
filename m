I appear to have failed to mention rb_find_add(), which is a bit of a
specialty, but I could imagine there being more like it the many rbtree
users out there (I count 300+ rb_link_node occurences).

Yeah; our current interface mandates you _understand_ binary trees, I
can imagine that's a step too far for some (sadly).

I can certainly add it in a separate patch; as might be evident from the
(lack) of changelogs on the whole, I basically split and posted the
thing the moment it booted. I figured I shouldn't sink more time into it
if people were going to hate it ;-)

I did consider it; in fact I my original helpers had that.

The reaosn I went with less() over cmp() is that the add() vs find()
function signatures:

  bool (*less)(struct rb_node *, const struct rb_node *);
  int (*cmp)(const void *, const struct rb_node *);

differ anyway in the left-hand argument; this is 'fixable' when you
use an (on-stack) dummy object for find (as uprobes does), but that
doesn't always work, esp. when the object is big. And given you need two
functions anyway, I figured it was useful to name them differently.

If you've looked at the other patches a bit, you'll see I've implemented
both functions as 'trivial' wrappers around a single compare function in
many cases.

Thanks, I suppose I'll go brush this up a bit more then.
