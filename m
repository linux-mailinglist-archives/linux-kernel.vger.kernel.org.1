Hm I think I'd rather make such pages really unmovable (by a pin?) than deny the
whole CMA area to compaction. Would it be feasible?

So now the free page scanner will have to skip those areas, which is not much
effective. But I suspect a worse problem in __compaction_suitable() which will
now falsely report that there are enough free pages, so compaction will start
but fail to do anytning. Minimally the __zone_watermark_ok() check there would
have to lose ALLOC_CMA, but there might be other similar checks that would need
adjusting.

And long-term what happens if the "CMA using ZONE_MOVABLE" approach is merged
and there are not more CMA migratetypes to test? Might this change actually also
avoid your issue, as said pages without __GFP_MOVABLE won't end up in a
ZONE_MOVABLE?
