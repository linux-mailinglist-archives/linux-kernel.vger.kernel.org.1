I agree with Greg's reasoning here. We had an almost identical thread
about this two years ago:

  http://lore.kernel.org/r/20180312132823.dixp7gkjypjlgymt@redbean.localdomain

I generally view module signature enforcement as a one way street. You
can go from unenforced to enforced, but not the other way around. If
you are anticipating the need to load unsigned modules or undo this
protection in general, then why are you building the kernel with
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE? It seems to defeat the purpose of enabling
this option. You could achieve the same behavior by building without
it and toggling module.sig_enforce on boot, no?

Thanks,

Jessica
