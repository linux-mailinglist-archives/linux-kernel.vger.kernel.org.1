Either right after allocation, or right before making the vmalloc'd data
structure visible to the instrumentation. In the case of the pid filter,
that would be the rcu_assign_pointer() which publishes the new pid filter
table.

As long as vmalloc_sync_mappings() is performed somewhere *between* allocation
and publishing the pointer for instrumentation, it's fine.

I'll let Steven decide on which approach works best for him.

Thanks,

Mathieu
