Right, got your point.

Was it not a problem that even if the application is sending writes
correctly, scheduler may not preserve the order.
And even when none is being used, re-queue can happen which may lead
to different ordering.

Fine.
But what about the null-block-zone which sets MQ-deadline but does not
actually use write-lock to avoid race among multiple appends on a
zone.
Does that deserve a fix?
