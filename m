I disagree; creating undocumented forks of an existing ondisk format
(especially one that presents as inconsistent metadata to regular tools)
is creating a ton of pain for future users and maintainers when the
incompat forks collide with the canonical implementation(s).

(Granted, I don't know if you /created/ this new interpretation of the
feature flag or if you've merely been stuck with it...)

I don't say that as a theoretical argument -- you've just crashed right
into this, because nobody knew that the in-kernel block validity doesn't
know how to deal with this other than to error out.

Seems like a good idea, particularly since you're asking for a format
change that requires kernel support and the ondisk format documentation
lives under Documentation/.  That said...

...Ted shot down this whole thing six months ago.

The Debian bug database is /not/ the designated forum to discuss changes
to the ondisk format; linux-ext4 is.
