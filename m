I understood Pavel's rationale as an output from my questions in the v1
series, that went like this, paraphrased:

Pavel: "I need to have other kmsg dump reasons available to pstore."
Kees:  "Why can't you just use the pstore console dumper?"
Pavel: "It's too much for the slow device; we only need to know about
        specific events that are already provided by kmsg dump."
Kees:  "Ah! Sounds good, max_reasons it is."

So, AIUI, loglevel remains orthogonal to this, and it's my fault for
even causing to be be brought up. Please disregard! :)

In my mind it seemed like a nice mapping, so it was an easy port.

Yes. For things I'm aware of: ARM devices with very tiny persistent RAM
were using ramoops and setting dump_oops to 0 (specifically, setting
the DT "no-dump-oops" to 1), and larger Android and Chrome OS devices
using ramoops were setting to dump_oops to 1[1].

The logic built into pstore recognizes a difference between panic and
non-panic dumps as well, as the expectation is that there is little to
no kernel infrastructure available for use during a panic kmsg.

I think dump_oops was the wrong implementation, but granularity control
is still needed. It is an old parameter, and is baked into many device
trees on systems, so I can't just drop it. (In fact, I've had to support
some other DT compat issues[2] as well.)

For dump_oops, yes, there is unfortunately.

Here are the problems I see being solved by this:

- lifting kmsg dump reason filtering out of the individual pstore
  backends and making it part of the "infrastructure", so that
  there is a central place to set expectations. Right now there
  is a mix of explicit and implicit kmsg dump handling:

  - arch/powerpc/kernel/nvram_64.c has a hard-coded list
  - drivers/firmware/efi/efi-pstore.c doesn't expect anything but
    OOPS and PANIC.
  - drivers/mtd/mtdoops.c tries to filter using its own dump_oops
    and doesn't expect anything but OOPS and PANIC.
  - fs/pstore/ram.c: has a hard-coded list and uses its own
    dump_oops.
  - drivers/mtd/mtdpstore.c (under development[3]) expected only
    OOPS and PANIC and had its own dump_oops.

- providing a way for backends that can deal with all kmsg dump reasons
  to do so without breaking existing default behavior (i.e. getting
  Pavel what he's interested in).

So, that said, I'm totally fine with a bit field. I just need a way to
map the kmsg dump reasons onto the existing backend expectations and to
have Pavel's needs addressed.
