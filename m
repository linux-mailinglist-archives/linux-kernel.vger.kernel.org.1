INTRODUCTION
============

I think this is the first time I have prepared a PDF manual with not 
only screenshots and photos, but text explanation as well. In the past, 
I have prepared lots of PDF manuals with only screenshots and photos and 
without any text explanation. You can search for all of my PDF manuals 
on my blogs. The links to my RAID 1 mirroring redundant blogs are:

I placed an order for my SGD$157 refurbished Fortigate 60D firewall 
appliance on 1st August 2020 Saturday at 7:47 PM Singapore Time. The 
seller is in Japan. I must say that FedEx international shipping from 
Japan to Singapore is very fast. I received my Fortigate 60D firewall 
appliance in Singapore on 4th August 2020 Tuesday at 12 noon Singapore 
Time. It took only 4 days for my Fortigate 60D to be shipped from Japan 
to Singapore.

Fortigate firewall appliances are based on the Linux Kernel and open 
source software.

I will be performing advanced configuration of my Fortigate 60D firewall 
soon. Do check out my blogs in the future.
