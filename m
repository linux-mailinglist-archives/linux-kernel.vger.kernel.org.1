It was originally documented as being roughly 4% for a page allocator
micro-benchmark but that was 4 years ago and I do not even remember what
type of machine that was on. Chances are the relative cost is different
now but I haven't measured it as the microbenchmark in question doesn't
even compile with recent kernels. For many allocations, the bulk of the
allocation cost is zeroing the page so I have no particular objection
to zone_watermark_fast being removed if it makes the code easier to
read. While I have not looked recently, the cost of allocation in general
and the increasing scope of the zone->lock with larger NUMA nodes for
high-order allocations like THP are more of a concern than two branches
and potentially two minor calculations.
