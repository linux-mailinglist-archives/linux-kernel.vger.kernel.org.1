I think it do helps we know which read failed in the first place when
communication error happens between FPGA & BMC.

Generally, if the error happens randomly on all registers, it may be the
problem of SPI bus.

But it is possible in some case error happens on some registers while
others are fine. The BMC has a internal Avalon mmio bus inside, and sub devices
connect on the bus. But the sub devices may response to the bus read/write
request differently according to hardware design. Once I run into a case
that the sub device stucks on one particular register read for long time
cause it prepares data so slowly. And the driver always timeout on that
register.
