I don't think this should be necessary - from lockdep perspective,
there should not be a difference between locking a range vs the entire
address space.

Actually to me the name is very secondary - the goal of the series is
to add an api abstracting the mmap locking. The lock name is secondary
to that, it only gets renamed because mmap_sem was too specific (if we
are to change the mmap locking) and to ensure we convert all direct
uses to use the api instead.

I like this idea a lot - having might_lock assertions in
get_user_pages_fast makes a log more sense than doing the same at the
call sites.

I think that is completely fine, makes sure everyone not using
FOLL_FAST_ONLY realizes that the call could block.

Can I ask you to add that assertion in your patchset ? Based on
Matthew's feedback, I would do it in my patchset, but it doesn't seem
worth doing if we know this will conflict with your changes.
