When you have a device assigned to a guest, it is used when the guest starts
probing the device. Some devices like VF's need DMA even to probe and get
resources assigned from the PF.

The only way we can do this is when device support ATS and PRS. And host
iommu driver to know if this fault needs to be handled by the host (if the
2nd level is at fault), or the guest if the walk in first level isn't
resolved.

2nd level faults need to be resolved by the VMM.
