My apologies, I neglected to include the repo to which these patches
apply into the cover letter. Will make sure to do it for next version.

Will do. The next version intends to follow your guidance and moves to
treating this platform feature as a property of the memory bandwidth
resource using the "arch_.." prefix that James also follows and is
intended to be architecture independent.

Thank you very much for your valuable feedback. I look forward to hear
what you think about the next version.
