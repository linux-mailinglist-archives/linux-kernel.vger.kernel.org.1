Please be more specific about usecases. This better have some strong
ones because THP code is complex enough already to add on top solely
based on a generic TLB pressure easing.

Do those pages get instantiated during the page fault or only via
khugepaged? This is an important design detail because then we have to
think carefully about how much automatic we want this to be. Memory
overhead can be quite large with 2MB THPs already. Also what about the
allocation overhead? Do you have any numbers?

Maybe all these details are described in the patcheset but the cover
letter should contain all that information. It doesn't make much sense
to dig into details in a patchset this large without having an idea how
feasible this is.

Thanks.
