OK, got it! I was just confused since I don't think that this patch
introduced the issue.

Before the patch 'int cpus = dl_bw_cpus(task_cpu(p))' was used which
returns the number of cpus on the (default) rd (n). So for a single CPU
(1024) we use n*1024.

I wonder if a fix for that should be part of this patch-set?

Yes, it does.

So my first idea was to only consider the CPU (i.e. its CPU capacity) in
case we detect 'cpu_rq(cpu)->rd == def_root_domain'?

In case I re-enable load-balancing on cpuset '/', we can't make a task
in cpuset 'B' DL since we hit this in __sched_setscheduler():

4931           /*
4932            * Don't allow tasks with an affinity mask smaller than
4933            * the entire root_domain to become SCHED_DEADLINE.
...
4935            */
4936            if (!cpumask_subset(span, p->cpus_ptr) || ...

root@juno:~# echo 1 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/cpuset.sched_load_balance
root@juno:~# echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/B/tasks
root@juno:~# chrt -d --sched-runtime 8000 --sched-period 16000 -p 0 $$
chrt: failed to set pid 2316's policy: Operation not permitted

So this task has to leave 'B' first I assume.
