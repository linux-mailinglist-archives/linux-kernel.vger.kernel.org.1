Rob, The dsi yaml files were split into dsi controller and dsi phy based 
on your comments on patch v2.
As per the comments, I added one common yaml file for controller with 
all the mandatory and optional properties along with their constraints 
and only the required properties for each target is mentioned in the 
target specific dsi-controller yaml file.

Thanks,
Krishna
