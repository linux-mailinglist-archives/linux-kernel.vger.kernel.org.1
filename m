Sure, will recheck that wiki, thanks.

Some cache info about the test box is, it's the Xeon Phi platform with
72 cores, and each core has 4 HT threads, so there are 288 CPUs. The L1
D-cache and I-cache are both 32KB. There is no L3 cache, and every 2
cores share one 1MB L2 cache. The L1 D-cache is 64 sets, 8 ways, and the
L2 cache is 1024 sets, 16 ways.

Thanks,
Feng
