Indeed, I'm talking about setns(pidfd, CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNS |
CLONE_NEWTIME). But also in general, the setns infrastructure has been
reworked and ideally all namespaces only perform permissions checks and
install the namespace into the passed in new struct nsset (which was
introduced this cycle) in their install handler (e.g. timens_install())
and don't make any task-visible changes yet but instead provide an
install routine that does not fail which is then called from 
static void commit_nsset(struct nsset *nsset)
in kernel/nsproxy.c.
