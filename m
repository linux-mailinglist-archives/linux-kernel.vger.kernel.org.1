This is DVFS request which firmware acknowledges quickly and expected
to at most 100us.

I am not complaining about that. The delay is mostly due to the load on
the mailbox and parallelising helps is the focus here.

Ah, the prints are when the client requested. It is not when the mailbox
started it. So this just indicates the beginning of the transfer from the
client. I must have mentioned that earlier. Some request timeout before
being picked up by mailbox if the previous request is not acknowledge
quickly. E.g. Say a sensor command started which may take upto 1ms,
almost 5-6 DVFS request after that will timeout.

Yes it does that for few requests like DVFS while it uses synchronous
mode for few others. While ideally I agree everything in asynchronous
most is better, I don't know there may be reasons for such design. Also
the solution given is to use different bits as independent channels
which hardware allows. Anyways it's open source SCP project[1].
