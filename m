Agreed. I mostly care about userspace facing ABI, though.

Maybe now that we re-explained, we can take another look at that?

I mostly think we should keep DFL generic where it touches userspace and
defines ABI, since we cannot change it afterwards.

I rest my point with the bus being independent of FPGAs despite the FPGA
being the (currently) only user.

I just think it doesn't make a lot of sense to call it fpga-dfl or
dfl-fpga. But if everyone else disagrees ... naming is hard :-)
