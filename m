Yeah, this looks very clean.

Or I also like Sean's idea about using the slow path - I think the answer could
depend on a better knowledge on the problem to solve (PCI scan for small VM
boots) to firstly justify that the fast path is required.  E.g., could we even
workaround that inefficient reading of 0xff's for our use case?  After all what
the BIOS really needs is not those 0xff's, but some other facts.

Thanks!
