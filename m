No, this is my reply to your suggestion #2.

The [0] is referenced further down.

The OF_MFD_CELL_REG() macro didn't exist until this patch-set.

There are currently no users.

No, I agreed with you that there is a current problem with
"stericsson,ab8500-pwm", as identified by Michael.  I didn't actually
know about this issue until *after* drafting this patch-set.  To be
clear the "stericsson,ab8500-pwm" scenario is not the reason for this
set's existence.

Also, please forget about the OF_MFD_* macros, they are totally
agnostic to this effort.  The only relevance they have here is the
addition of 1 extra macro which *could* be used to provide the 'reg'
property where appropriate.

That is not my vision.  There is no need for "stericsson,ab8500-pwm"
to have 'reg' properties as far as I see it.

That's not a problem with this patch-set, it's a problem with your
understanding of this patch-set. :)

As far as I know, there aren't any current users who would benefit
from this work.  Instead, it is designed to provide future submitters
with another tool to help them link their child devices to the correct
OF nodes.  That's not to say that current users can't and won't
benefit from this.  Just that they are not the target audience.

Because DT is meant to describe the hardware, not the implementation.

DT does not know, or care that in our case most operations that happen
on the platform are passed back via an API to a central controlling
location.  Or that in reality, the OF node in this situation is
superfluous.

Can we please stop talking about the AB8500.  It doesn't have anything
to do with this series besides the fact that if it (this set) had
existed *before* 'ab8500-pwm' was OF enabled, it wouldn't now be
wonky.

If you want to talk about the AB8500, please start a new thread.

Please see "[0]" above!

AFAICT your solution #2 involves bombing out *all* devices if there is
a duplicate compatible with no 'reg' property value.  This is a)
over-kill and b) not an error, as I mentioned:
