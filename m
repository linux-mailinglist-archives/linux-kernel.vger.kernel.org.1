We have finally got to the bottom of this - the "bug" is in the ext4
code:

static inline u32 ext4_chksum(struct ext4_sb_info *sbi, u32 crc,
                              const void *address, unsigned int length)
{
        struct {
                struct shash_desc shash;
                char ctx[4];
        } desc;

        BUG_ON(crypto_shash_descsize(sbi->s_chksum_driver)!=sizeof(desc.ctx));

        desc.shash.tfm = sbi->s_chksum_driver;
        *(u32 *)desc.ctx = crc;

        BUG_ON(crypto_shash_update(&desc.shash, address, length));

        return *(u32 *)desc.ctx;
}

This isn't always inlined, despite the "inline" keyword. With GCC
4.9.4, this is compiled to the following code when the stack protector
is disabled:

0000000000000004 <ext4_chksum.isra.14.constprop.19>:

  4c:   910003bf        mov     sp, x29				<======
  50:   b9408260        ldr     w0, [x19, #128]			<======
  54:   f9400bf3        ldr     x19, [sp, #16]
  58:   a8c27bfd        ldp     x29, x30, [sp], #32

  64:   97ffffe7        bl      0 <ext4_chksum.isra.14.part.15>

Of the instructions that are highlighted with "<------" and "<======",
x29 is located at the bottom of the function's stack frame, excluding
local variables.  x19 is "desc", which is calculated to be safely below
x29 and aligned to a 128 byte boundary.

The bug is pointed to by the two "<======" markers - the instruction
at 4c restores the stack pointer _above_ "desc" before then loading
desc.ctx.

If an interrupt occurs right between these two instructions, then
desc.ctx will be corrupted, leading to the checksum failing.

Comments on irc are long the lines of this being "an impressive
compiler bug".

We now need to find which gcc versions are affected, so we know what
minimum version to require for aarch64.

Arnd has been unable to find anything in gcc bugzilla to explain this;
he's tested gcc-5.5.0, which appears to produce correct code, and is
trying to bisect between 4.9.4 and 5.1.0 to locate where this was
fixed.

Peter Zijlstra suggested adding linux-toolchains@ and asking compiler
folks for feedback on this bug. I guess a pointer to whether this is
a known bug, and which bug may be useful.

I am very relieved to have found a positive reason for this bug, rather
than just moving forward on the compiler and have the bug vanish
without explanation, never knowing if it would rear its head in future
and corrupt my filesystems, e.g. never knowing if it became a
temporarily masked memory ordering bug.
