The update-forms are stdux, sthux etc. right?

I don't see any change in the number of those with or without the
constraint. That's using GCC 9.3.0.

As I said in my other mail that's not really up to us. We could mandate
a higher minimum for powerpc, but I'd rather not.

I think for now I'm inclined to just drop the "<>", and we can revisit
in a release or two when hopefully GCC 4.8 has become the minimum.
