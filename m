Would you consider adding a tools/perf/tests/ entry to do these checks,
i.e. run some synthetic workload, record some of these events, then do
this math, to check that perf is doing the right thing?

The starting point is something like:

  $ ls -la tools/perf/tests/sw-clock.c 
  -rw-rw-r--. 1 acme acme 3326 Aug 14 09:00 tools/perf/tests/sw-clock.c
  $ 
  $ wc -l tools/perf/tests/sw-clock.c 
  149 tools/perf/tests/sw-clock.c
  $ 
  $ perf test clock
  25: Software clock events period values                   : Ok
  $ perf test -v clock
  Couldn't bump rlimit(MEMLOCK), failures may take place when creating BPF maps, etc
  25: Software clock events period values                   :
  --- start ---
  test child forked, pid 3455348
  mmap size 528384B
  mmap size 528384B
  test child finished with 0
  ---- end ----
  Software clock events period values: Ok
  $

This way, everytime we go sending patches upstream and do:

  # perf test

We make sure the changes in the current batch of patches being submitted
don't regress,

Thanks for your consideration and for your patches and detailed
discussion,

Regards,

P.S.: The SNOOPX fix for tools/ is already in Linus tree, he even
noticed that now the kernel UAPI header is out of sync and needs that
fix :-)
