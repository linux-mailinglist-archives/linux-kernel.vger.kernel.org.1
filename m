Thomas said we actually first do VMEXIT, and then enable interrupts. So
the VMEXIT thing should actually work, and that is indeed much saner
than sticking it in irq_enter().

It does however put yet more nails in the out-of-tree hypervisors.

Correct, the vCPU still running can glean host (kernel) state from the
sibling handling the interrupt in the host kernel.

That doesn't completely solve things I think. Even if you run all
untrusted tasks as core exclusive, you still have a problem of them vs
interrupts on the other sibling.

You need to somehow arrange all interrupts to the core happen on the
same sibling that runs your untrusted task, such that the VERW on
return-to-userspace works as intended.

I suppose you can try and play funny games with interrupt routing tied
to the force-idle state, but I'm dreading what that'll look like. Or
were you going to handle this from your irq_enter() thing too?


Can someone go write up a document that very clearly states all the
problems and clearly explains how to use this feature?
