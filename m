Please no.

What I would suggest doing is create your own buffer to store the output.
Then use the seq_buf() operations and such to print to that buffer, and
then be able to read that output from something like a debug filesystem, or
some user space daemon that will write to syslog.

I do not want 'silent' writes to the printk buffer. It's bad enough that it
gets blown away by systemd.
