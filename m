My opinion is that the warning is too late to add at this stage. It
would have been much better if the user interface has provided a
reasonable feedback on how much the request was sucessful. But this
is not the case (except for few error cases) and we have to live with
the interface where the caller has to read the value after writing to
it. Lame but a reality.

I have heard about people making an opportunistic attempt to grab as
many hugetlb pages as possible and they do expect the failure and scale
the request size down. I do not think those would appreciate warnings.

That being said I would rather keep the existing behavior even though it
is suboptimal. It is just trivial to add the check in the userspace
without risking complains by other users. Besides the warning is not
really telling us much more than a subsequent read anyway. You are not
going to learn why the allocation has failed because that one is done
(intentionaly) as __GFP_NOWARN.
