The worry is not just about modules abuse IMO. We can put a filter in our
emails to catch all patches that try to use this API. I don't think we can
assume we'd catch all.

I didn't think much about it. But we can relax the wrapper if really needed.
IMO the kernel should present a predictable behavior for userspace. But I don't
know a lot about DL to comment. The easy answer the wrapper could be relaxed to
offer the required tunables without giving direct access to
sched_setscheduler().
