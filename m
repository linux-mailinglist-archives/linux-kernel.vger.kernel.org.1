It's probably me who's missing something important here :-) but I think
you describe how it *should* work as I'm not seeing how we can leave the
loop in kvm_async_pf_task_wait_schedule() other than by 
"if (hlist_unhashed(&n.link)) break;" and this only happens when APF
completes.

When guest receives the 'page ready' event with an error it (like for
every other 'page ready' event) tries to wake up the corresponding
process but if the process is dead already it can do in-kernel probing
of the GFN, this way we guarantee that the error is always injected. I'm
not sure if it is needed though but in case it is, this can be a
solution. We can add a new feature bit and only deliver errors when the
guest indicates that it knows what to do with them.
