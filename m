Yes.  We don't need to check for a DMA to the device, but a DMA from
the device while under DMA obviously is bogus.  But then again you'd
need to try really hard to do that.

The whole thing predates my involvement with the code, but I defintively
think the patch from Hugh is a major improvement.  But I would also
have no problem with just removing it entirely.
