We wan't to transfer uncached 4K Video frames via UVC. So Scatter-Gather
is a must anyway.

In function/gadget/uvc_video.c we take a buffer and pump it into many
available requests as we find. On the way the driver can drain that
video frame queue, in that case we could stop the transfer. I have
prepared a patch where we have only one source, queueing new requests,
so this could work.

For now to limit the interrupt load on the dwc3 driver we already set
the request no_interrupt on every nth request, and make sure the
interrupt is on the very last one of the frame. But with that we still
sometimes run into missed transfers as the queued trb list somehow ends
up with a TRB not having the IOC bit set.

I will send the patches for that so we can discuss the right handling
for that in a separate thread.
