Yes, this problematic scenario is just there to illustrate my point.

I would have though the part "before this interrupt wrote to it" would
actually be "before this event wrote to it" (?) Am I confused ?

I'm still concerned about local64 on 32-bit, as per my prior email.

This seems to assume that before_stamp is always written to in a monotonic
fashion except in this very specific corner-case. But what happens if this
algorithm is interrupted between reading the clock() current time and
writing to before_stamp ? This can happen both for the outer event and
at various nesting levels as well. I'm concerned that this scenario
would also cause before_stamp to go backwards, but would not be handled
correctly.

I solve this by using cmpxchg instead of xadd for [C], and retry space
reservation with a new timestamp. ;-)

Agreed on the fact that the difference does not matter much in practice.

Can we have this scenario at an extra nesting level ? Basically
we add an outermost event 0 at nesting level 0, and shift events 1, 2, 3
to nesting levels 1, 2 in your scenario ? If it is possible, will the
special-case handling it also trigger ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
