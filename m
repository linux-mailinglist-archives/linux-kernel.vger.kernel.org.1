I was referring to the two following APIs:

- spin_lock()
- smp_load_acquire()

on x86, spin_lock() happens to be implemented with an atomic instruction, which
implies a full memory barrier. However, its smp_load_acquire() does not provide
a full memory barrier. Therefore, if we implement a smp_mb__after_acquire() as
proposed by Peter, we could expect it to cover both APIs, which is tricky to do
efficiently without adding a superfluous barrier.

Hence the discussion about make its naming more specific, so it does not cover
smp_load_acquire.

Good point.

As long as we can state that smp_mb__after_spinlock applies both to raw_spinlock
and non-raw spinlock (which AFAIU are mutexes on RT), I think it would suffice for
our immediate needs.

Thanks,
