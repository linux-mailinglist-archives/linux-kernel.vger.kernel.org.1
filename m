So this is a great fix, thanks for sending it.  That said, there are a
couple of ways in which this fix can be made even better:

 - The simpler of the two is to change the subject line of the patch.
   "Fix a warning" is almost never a good description of what you're
   doing; what you are actually doing is fixing a broken cross reference.
   So the subject line should say that.

 - In this case, though, there is a much better thing to do.  We
   deprecated the use of :c:func: around a year ago; the docs build system
   can now do the right thing automatically.  So a fix that would both
   eliminate the warning and improve the document as a whole would be to
   replace every instance of:

	:c:func:`function_name`

   with:

	function_name()

Is there any chance I could get you to send a patch that does that?

Thanks,

jon
