Yes, it's safe to apply "clk: tegra: Don't enable PLLE HW sequencer at init"
before the others have applied. Disabling PLLE hardware power sequencer will not
cause any functionality problem to XUSB/PCIE/SATA. The only thing changed is
PLLE won't be powered off by hardware when all clients are in low power state,
i.e., software has to explicitly power off PLLE.

Thanks for review.
