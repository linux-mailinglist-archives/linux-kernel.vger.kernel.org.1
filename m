Right, I was confused by that RAND column, until Jethro corrected me.

Actually, quoting enclave (QE) authorizes itself with a provisioning
certification enclave (PCE), which holds certificates and revocation
lists for provisioning secrets unique to a CPU. And the sequence that I
described happens between PCE and QE. It accepts requests from enclaves
with ATTRIBUTES.PROVISION key bits set to 1 according to:

  https://software.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/intel-sgx-support-for-third-party-attestation-801017.pdf

The source code for the reference  is available here:

  https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives

And binaries are here:

  https://01.org/intel-softwareguard-extensions/downloads/intel-sgx-dcap-1.6-release

They are provided for the inevitable reason that, it is the way bind to
the hardware, i.e. proof that you are running on a genuine CPU.

The network part is that PCE and QE can certify to an application, if an
enclave running in a different computer is an enclave.
