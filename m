Oh, and we may have to commit things in a very specific order
to guarantee the hw doesn't fall over, so yeah definitely per-crtc
thread is a no go.

I don't even understand the serialization argument. If the commits
are truly independent then why isn't the unbound wq enough to avoid
the serialization? It should just spin up a new thread for each commit
no?
