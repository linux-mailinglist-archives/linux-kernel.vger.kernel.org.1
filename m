DFL is a method to discover devices. If a different subsystem (e.g. ASIC based
DFL bus) want to use DFL and follows the DFL spec, they could just use the DFL
stuff for enumeration, no need to have new variants.

I'm glad that we made it clear. And the bus name & user APIs cound be
kept as "dfl". So I assume the name "dfl" is OK to be used and could
be recognized by people out of FPGA domain, is it?

If so, I still want to keep the name "dfl_device_id" in mod_devicetable.h
as well. We want to keep the device id name of the bus aligned with the
bus name. And it would be confusing as well if a driver for ASIC based
DFL device uses the "dfl_fpga_device_id" structure.

How do you think?

Yilun
