On 32-bit, the vdso mode is a side-effect of how we build the kernel
image. I guess we haven't put much thought into whether we want to keep
the vdso in Thumb-2 or ARM mode.

We could leave the config option in if we ever need to change the compat
vdso mode. But as not to confuse others with too many options, maybe
add:

	bool "Compile the vDSO in THUMB2 mode" if EXPERT

Either way:
