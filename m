The application itself is not RT, since there is no good way to know
what other things the app may be doing.  Although that is mentioned in
the lwn article (ie. the hypothetical SCHED_DEADLINE + token passing
part)

But at least once the app / ui thread is done, then it is all (or at
least in theory "all" if atomic-helper doesn't gum up the works ;-))
SCHED_FIFO from there to the display.
