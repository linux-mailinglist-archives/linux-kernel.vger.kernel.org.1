Looks good, queued, thank you!

I did a bit of editing as shown below.  Please let me know if I messed
anything up.

							Thanx, Paul

commit 61b82b349d0089120a9705240ece6ecf2b176fd5
Author: Joel Fernandes (Google) <joel@joelfernandes.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 7 13:07:20 2020 -0400

    rcu: Make FQS more aggressive in complaining about offline CPUs
    
    The RCU grace-period kthread's force-quiescent state (FQS) loop should
    never see an offline CPU that has not yet reported a quiescent state.
    After all, the offline CPU should have reported a quiescent state
    during the CPU-offline process, or, failing that, by rcu_gp_init()
    if it ran concurrently with either the CPU going offline or the last
    task on a leaf rcu_node structure exiting its RCU read-side critical
    section while all CPUs corresponding to that structure are offline.
    The FQS loop should therefore complain if it does see an offline CPU
    that has not yet reported a quiescent state.
    
    And it does, but only once the grace period has been in force for a
    full second.  This commit therefore makes this warning more aggressive,
    so that it will trigger as soon as the condition makes its appearance.
    
    Light testing with TREE03 and hotplug shows no warnings.  This commit
    also converts the warning to WARN_ON_ONCE() in order to stave off possible
    log spam.
