Hmm are you sure we can drop it? access_ok is done in the context
of the process. Access itself in the context of a kernel thread
that borrows the same mm. IIUC if the process can be 32 bit
while the kernel is 64 bit, access_ok in the context of the
kernel thread will not DTRT.

That's true. Limit check cost is measureable but very small.
It's the speculation barrier that's costly.
