Agreed

You simply have to add two wrapper such as the following:

static inline void rproc_rsc_set_addr(u32 *low, u32 *hi, u64 val)
{
=09*low =3D lower_32_bits(val);
=09*hi =3D upper_32_bits(val);
}

static inline u64 rproc_rsc_get_addr(u32 low, u32 hi)
{
=09return ((u64) hi << 32) | low;
}

This is not really difficult to use and will ensure your new trace
resource can be used easily without breaking 32 bits alignment.
Breaking compatibility is an option also and it is probably needed
to document it clearly if it is chosen to do so.

Agreed, this is most of the case indeed where the memories are actually
accessible directly. But using ioremap potentially creates a mapping that
does not support misaligned accesses and so accesses should be always align=
ed.
memcpy_from/to_io ensures that.
IMHO, there is probably something to be rework since the drivers are mappin=
g
the memories but the core is accessing this memory, knowing nothing about
how it was mapped.
