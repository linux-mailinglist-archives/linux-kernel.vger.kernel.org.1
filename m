This comment is out of place and I will choose to ignore it.

This is not a quirk, nor a software work-around, This is a design
decision affecting the storage stack of several OEMs. As such, I would
like to find a way to implement this functionality.

Last time we discussed this in the mailing list, you among others
pointed to append emulation as the best way to enable this path and here
we are. Can you explained what changed?

We take the SPDK discussion in the appropriate mailing lists and slack
channels.
