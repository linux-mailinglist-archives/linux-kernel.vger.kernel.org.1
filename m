OK, I think that we are ready to try this in linux-next.
I am going to push it there via printk/linux.git.

I have a good feeling about the patchset. The great thing is that
the access is still synchronized using logbuf_lock so that we do not
have to deal with races for the moment.

Of course, there are still many potential problems. The following comes
to my mind:

   + Bugs in the algorithm logic or implementation might prevent
     showing any messages on consoles or via syslog or /dev/kmsg.
     We did our best to avoid it.

   + Debugging tools accessing the buffer directly would need to
     understand the new structure. Fortunately John provided
     patches for the most prominent ones.

   + Small devices might complain about less effective use of memory.
     Part of descriptors and dictionaries ring buffers might stay
     unused. But it hopefully could get tuned.


This is basically just a start of the journey. I hope that it will be a
good one.

Best Regards,
Petr
