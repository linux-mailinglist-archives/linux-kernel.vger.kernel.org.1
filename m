Hi

Sorry if this is not the right place for this email but I can't think of 
another place (might be linux-fsdevel)
Someone here is ought to be an expert in this.

It all started as having file corruptions inside VMs that then led to 
alot of testing that
resulted in replicatable results on the backend NAS.

Tests where done by generating 100 1GB files from /dev/urandom to 
"volume1" (both BTRFS and EXT4 tested).
MD5 hashing the files and then copying the files to "volume2". 2-4% of 
the files would fail the hash match every time
the test was done.

After alot of fiddling around it turned out that the problem goes away 
if doing "cp --sparse=never"
when copying the files. This would to me exclude any hardware errors and 
feels more like something
deeper inside the kernel.

The box runs Kernel 3.10.105. Version >4 seems unaffected (not 100% 
confirmed, too few testboxes).

Here is a diff between a hexdump of a failed file,

As you can see it's a single flipped bit (31f4, 3174). I'm not sure 
about "fa4M-5". Never seen "M-" before.
