Subject: [PATCH V6 2/4] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Add wakeup support for BT UART on sc7180-idp

Add the necessary pinctrl, interrupt property and a suitable sleep config
to support Bluetooth wakeup feature.

GPIO mode is configured in sleep state to drive the RTS/RFR line low.
If QUP function is selected in sleep state, UART RTS/RFR is pulled high
during suspend and BT SoC not able to send wakeup bytes.

Changes in V2:
 - This patch adds sleep state for BT UART. Newly added in V2.

Changes in V3:
 - Remove "output-high" for TX from both sleep and default states
   as it is not required. Configure pull-up for TX in sleep state.

Changes in V4:
 - As per Matthias's comment, removed drive-strength for sleep state
   and fixed nit-pick.

Changes in V5:
 - As per Matthias's comments, moved pinmux change for sleep state,
   pinctrl and interrupt config to the board specific file.

Changes in V6:
 - As per Doug's comments changed subject, deleted interrupts property.
 - As per Bjorn's comments changed commit text and rationale for RTS,
   TX and RX.
