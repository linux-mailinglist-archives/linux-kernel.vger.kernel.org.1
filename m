Right, this 24 MHz is a recurring problem.
But what I was asking was if the NAU8825 is fine working with e.g. a 
2.4MHz bit clock. i.e. with 25 bit slots or padding at the end of the frame?

There are two KBL drivers that control the SSP clocks from the machine 
driver, but indeed I don't know if this would work on Firmware, it'd be 
a question for Lech/Cezary.
