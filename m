Would it be OK to implement a lock down mechanism for the PF PASID
capability, preventing changes to the PF cap when the VF is in use by
VFIO?  The emulation would still break the spec: since the PF cap would
always be enabled the VF configuration bits would have no effect, but it
seems preferable to having the Enable bit not enable anything.

Userspace might have more difficulty working around the issues mentioned
in this thread. They would still need a guarantee that the PF PASID
configuration doesn't change at runtime, and they wouldn't have the
ability to talk to a vendor driver to figure out where to place the fake
PASID capability.
