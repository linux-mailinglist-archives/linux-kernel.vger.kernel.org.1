possibly longer, qcom_iommu sets CFCFG..

I'm not too picky on what we call it, but afaict it has been this way
since the beginning of time, rather than specific to a certain SoC or
generation of SoCs.  So it doesn't seem like the hw designers consider
it a bug.

(I'm not sure what the expected behavior is.. nor if any other SMMU
implementation encounters this sort of situation..)
