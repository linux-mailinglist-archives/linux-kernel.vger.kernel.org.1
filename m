Hi Coly,

Why you limit the iodeph to 8 and iops to 150 on cache device?
For cache device the limitation is small. Iosp 150 with 4KB block size,
it means every hour writing (150*4*60*60=2160000KB=) 2GB data. For 35
hours it is only 70GB.


What if the iodepth is 128 or 64, and no iops rate limitation ?
-> There are two reasons why I limit the iodepth and iops rate.
1. If I don't limit them, the dirty cache will be filled up very
quickly within 20 minutes.
     It's almost NVME speed before it reaches the 70
cutoff_writeback_sync, there is no way for any kind of writeback to
stop it from
     filling up due to the huge gap between NVME and HDD in terms of
the throughput,
     I don't think there is anything we can do about it? and it should
only happen in a benchmark world, not should in production.
     The improvement I'm trying to do here is just for normal
production workload ,not for this benchmark scenario really.
     I currently can't see any necessity to test this scenario, please
kindly let me know about this if I'm wrong.

2. The reason that I set iodepth to 8 and iops to 150 is based on the
experience that I observed from production env, mostly ceph,
    ceph-osd has less than 10 thread(default setting) that will send
io to bcache in parallel. But I'm not sure about other applications.
    I agree that we can increase the iodepth to 64 or 128 and it's
doable. But we have to limit the iops, 150 IOPS is a reasonable
workload.
    The most busy ceph-osd that I've seen is about 1000 IOPS, but on
average is still only about 600.
    I can set the IOPS to a higher value like 600 and the iodepth to
128 to perform the later test if it make sense to you?

Lastly, please allow me to clarify more about the production issue
that this patch is trying to address:

In the production env that hit this issue, it usually takes a very
long time (many take days) for the cache_available_percent to drop to
30, and the dirty data is mostly staying at a very low level (around
10 percent), which means that the bcache isn't being stressed very
hard most of the time.
 There is no intention to save the cutoff_writeback_sync when the
bcache is being stressed without limitation, hope above make sense :)

By the way, my colleague and I are trying to gathering some production
bcache stats, I hope we can give you the performance number before and
after applying the patch.

Thanks,
Dongdong
