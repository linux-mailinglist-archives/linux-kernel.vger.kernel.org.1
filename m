I tried Renoise, a good tracker app with 0.33 ms latency. It was really 
good. Tech Trance in the 90s was all about tracking.

( a little playlist here for interested 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpA7__w8yeJ0g6cF0m_y_h-HWjzCNTuWm )

Latency on the amiga at that time was very low. More like 0.33 ms 
latency, or even 0.2.

We want this kind of latency again. Also having in mind a few samples 
for clocking the D/A well if necessary.

D/A could be a 1bit converter with few analogue components on the 
output, maybe simply a 1 pole diode filter, if possible. This could work 
well on a bitstream shifted up in frequency.

It seems to use almost a whole cpu just at this latency. It works well 
though.

One might want to look into performance bottlenecks here, hardware aid, 
or cpu instruction set enhancements. Inner loop optimization beyond HZ 
timer etc, which is at 91 here.
