I think this provides a pretty clear guidance on what you/the community 
are looking for, both now and possibly in the future.

Thank you.

 From my perspective, it would be really nice if there was something 
like Mesa that was a/the standard for these sorts of accelerators.  Its 
somewhat the wild west, and we've struggled with it.

I don't work on the compiler end of things, but based on what I've seen 
in my project, I think the vendors are going to be highly resistant to 
opening that up.  There is more than just the raw instruction set that 
goes on in the device, and its viewed as "secret sauce" even though I 
agree with your previous statements on that viewpoint.
