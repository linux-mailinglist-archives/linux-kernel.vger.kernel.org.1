I use it to operate KSZ8851-16MLL ethernet chip, which has async bus
interface. Linux just didn't have support for that mode of operation
thus far and the FMC was used to operate NANDs and NORs only. This
series, or rather, the first three patches in this series, add support
for operating other bus devices, like this ethernet controller.

I don't think it's _just_ a memory controller, it's more universal than
that, see above. Note that SRAM interface basically boils down to
anything which has external parallel bus, e.g. Davicom DM9000, that
KSZ8851-16MLL etc.

I see.
