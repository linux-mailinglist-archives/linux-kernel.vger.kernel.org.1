Sure, we could carry a local patch.  ...but Chrome OS tries not to be
like all other distros.  We try very hard (and keep trying harder each
year) to _not_ carry local patches.  Sure, we fail sometimes, but we
will still try.  In general it seems like the upstream Linux community
pushes distros and other Linux users to be upstream first so it's a
little discouraging to hear the advice of "just carry a local patch".

In this case, though, I should close the loop.  Abhishek can correct
me if I'm wrong, but I think the answer here was that it _wasn't_ sane
for us to change this option via KConfig or even via kernel command
line.  I believe that Abhishek found that it was better to (in
userspace) look at the sysfs nodes and configure things how he wanted
it at runtime.

Yes, years ago.  References:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/1326492948-26160-1-git-send-email-dianders@chromium.org
https://lore.kernel.org/r/1328223508-1228-1-git-send-email-dianders@chromium.org

I didn't keep poking it because I got advice (not on the mailing list)
that it was better to add a KConfig option rather than extending the
command line.  ;-)  At the time it seemed a reasonable argument to me
so I didn't keep pushing that patch.

It's funny.  Your argument is the same as mine but the opposite.  I
say: "but so much crap will be in the command line and it will be
crazy" and you say "but so much crap will be in the KConfig and it
will be crazy".  ;-)  I guess it depends on where you want to dump
your trash.

Right.  To be clear, I definitely wasn't suggesting the option be
_removed_ from the command line.

Again, I think it gets into a matter of opinion.  I'm also objecting
to setting a precedence, but in the opposite direction.  Today in
Chrome OS we don't need to use the command line extending for this
type of thing at all and (IMO) it's really nice.  Your config options
are in one place, not mixed halfway between the command line and the
KConfig.  Allowing this one config option to be configured in the
command line opens the flood gates for having two places to look for
the base config.  ;-)

In any case, it doesn't sound like I'm going to convince you.  Also,
since Abhishek has found another way to move forward it sounds like
the right thing is to consider his patch abandoned anyway.

I have no objections to someone upstreaming those patches, for sure.
Maybe one day the Android team will do it since they seem to have been
carrying it as a local patch forever.  If nothing else, it gives us
more flexibility.
