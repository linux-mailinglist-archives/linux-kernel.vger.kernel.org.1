Hi,

I suggested something similar to my customer, by using
libsyscall-intercept.  The idea would be overwritting the syscall
instruction with a call to the entry point.  I'm not a specialist on the
specifics of Windows games, (cc'ed Paul Gofman, who can provide more
details on that side), but as far as I understand, the reason why that
is not feasible is that the anti-cheat protection in games will abort
execution if the binary region was modified either on-disk or in-memory.

Is there some mechanism to do that without modiyfing the application?
