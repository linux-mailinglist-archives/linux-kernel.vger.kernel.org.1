It simply doesn't scale. That's why CSV2 exists in the first place, so we
don't have to modify the kernel everytime a new CPU is invented.

Well that's for somebody to figure out in the patch. I'm just saying that
adding cores to the safe list when they already have a CSV2 field conveying
the same information is the wrong approach. The right appproach is for KVM
to expose CSV2 as set when the system is not affected by the erratum.

FWIW, I'll be sending some patches soon to clean a lot of this up, so maybe
it will become clearer after that.
