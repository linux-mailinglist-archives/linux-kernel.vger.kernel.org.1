I am surprised you don't see it on the Intel processor. Maybe it does
not have UMIP. Do you see umip when you do

$ grep umip /proc/cpuinfo

I have a patch for this already that I wrote for testing purposes:

https://github.com/ricardon/tip/commit/1692889cb3f8accb523d44b682458e234b93be50

Perhaps it can be used as a starting point? Not sure what the spoofing
value should be, though. Perhaps 0?

Thanks and BR,
