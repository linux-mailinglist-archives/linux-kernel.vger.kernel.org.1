Understood, but there is a time window in which CMA reservation is available
irrespective of whether it is called from arch or generic code. Finding this
right time window and ensuring that N_MEMORY nodemask is initialized, easier
done in the platform code.

Ensuring that N_MEMORY nodemask is initialized from the generic code is even
more difficult.

But moving hugetlb CMA reservation completely during command line processing
has got another concern of mixing with existing memblock based pre-allocation.

It is rationale to move CMA reservation stuff into generic HugeTLB but there
are some challenges which needs to be solved comprehensively. The patch here
from Barry does solve a short term problem (N_ONLINE ---> N_MEMORY) for now
which IMHO should be considered. Moving CMA reservation into generic HugeTLB
would require some more thoughts and can be attempted later.
