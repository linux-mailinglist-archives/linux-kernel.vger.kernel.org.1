You proposed essentially  \( A \| B \) \( | C \| \)

This is not valid syntax in the semantic patch language.  The branches of
a \( \| \) have to be a valid expression, statement, type, etc, not some
random string of tokens.

These are not "usual risks".  You can easily test out your suggestion by
yourself to see if it produces valid code.  If it doesn't, then don't make
the suggestion.

Whenever you propose the same thing say 10 times or more and it is
rejected every time, I thikn you should be able to conclude that if you
propose the same thing again it will be rejected.

No, I don't consider the effect to be desirable.

Not really.  My "change acceptance" increases when the person reporting
them raises real problems that is blocking them in some work.  And it
decreases rapidly when the changes are almost all related to presumed
"efficiencies" that have no impact in practice.
