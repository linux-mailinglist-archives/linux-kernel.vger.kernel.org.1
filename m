Good idea.

Hrm, I guess my compiler isn't set to warn for that?  :-/

...in any case I think the right thing to do here is to add
"default:".  Really we _only_ care about the ones we already have
cases for and if anyone adds any other notifications we really don't
care about them.

Actually, maybe I should just do a spin_trylock().  If I fail to get
the lock I can just return NOTIFY_BAD, right?

I'm going to leave that change out for now.  Maulik says there are
other code paths in future patches that will call rpmh_flush().  If we
see every call to rpmh_flush() follow the same pattern then we can
roll it in then?

Oh, I think we have a bug here.  If we return NOTIFY_BAD we probably
need to decrement our count.  From reading the code I think
CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED doesn't get called for the person that returned
NOTIFY_BAD.  I'll try to confirm, then fix.

Oops.  Somehow I thought I had checked that and the ABBA was only
there before all the cleanup patches, but I think you're right.  I
think I can fix this by just changing the order we grab locks in
tcs_write().  At first I was bummed because I thought that would mean
I'd have to hold both locks while calling:

  __tcs_buffer_write(drv, tcs_id, 0, msg);
  __tcs_set_trigger(drv, tcs_id, true);

...but I just realized that even if I change the order I grab the
locks it doesn't mean I have to change the order I release the locks!


I'll plan to send another spin tomorrow since my day is about over now.
