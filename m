Above is not required for now in this patchset, as we can attach data at 
runtime specific to version of the qfprom.

This can be added when required!

Am not sure if I understand this correctly, reg-names are very useful in 
this particular case as we are dealing with multiple memory ranges with 
holes. I agree with not having this for cases where we have only one 
resource.

But having the ordering in DT without proper names associated with it 
seems fragile to me! And it makes very difficult to debug issues with 
wrong resource ordering in DT.

Rob, Is this the guidance for new bindings?

I have not seen any strong suggestion or guidance either in
 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt?h=v5.8-rc1 
  Or in ./drivers/of/address.c

Am I missing anything here?
