OK, I will update my current kmalloc_valid_obj() to kmem_valid_obj(),
thank you!

Then _obj() it is.

OK, understood.

Suggestions on where to put the mem_dump_obj() or whatever name that
executes this code?  Left to myself, I will pick a likely on the theory
that it can always be moved later.

This structuring does cause double work, but this should be OK because
all of the uses I know of are on error paths.

Within slab, agreed.

We course also need something like mem_dump_obj() to handle a pointer
with unknown provenance, along with the vmalloc_valid_obj() and the
vmalloc_dump_obj().  And similar functions should other allocation
sources become important.
