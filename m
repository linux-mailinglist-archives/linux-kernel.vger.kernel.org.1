the reason I ask is that if it's caused by dwc3 revision, then we don't
need the extra dt property, we can rely on a revision check. If it's
something that can't be detected in runtime, then we need a property.

This isn't even listed as a known revision in dwc3/core.h. Thinh, could
the issue being described here caused by a known Erratum with this
particular revision?
