Cool? No bugs running it? (I still need to extend support for many
architectures)

I'd expect these to have distinct lifetimes resulting in stack slot
reuse.  When the compiler inlines functions, it introduces a lexical
scope. You can imagine it inlining the body, but within a new `{}`
delineated compound statement.  Then the compiler knows that the
variables local to those scopes can't outlive each other, and can
reuse their stack slots in the containing function.  Escape analysis
comes into play, too, but I'm not sure that's an issue here.

The general case we try to find+fix with this warning is excessively
large stack allocations that probably should be heap allocated,
percpu, or static.  Also, the `noinline_for_stack` function annotation
is used frequently for this.

One known case of issues are the sanitizers, which can generally
prevent the reuse of stack slots.  Were any of those set in this
config, since this was a randconfig?  I'd check this first, then
consider if `noinline_for_stack` is appropriate on any of the related
functions.

The flag -Wframe-larger-than= is a warning on semantics, not really an
optimization flag controlling the maximum stack depth of the function
being inlined into.

That's not really how inlining works.  If you don't specify compiler
attributes, then the compiler can decide to inline or not at its
discretion.  The `inline` keyword or its absence doesn't really affect
this.  __attribute__((always_inline)) and __attribute__((noinline))
can give you more control, but there are hyper obscure edge cases
where even those don't work as advertised.
