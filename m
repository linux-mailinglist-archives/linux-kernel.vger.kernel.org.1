That works fine. I will do this as third patch in our patch-set.  But I think we also should export the permission-map
somewhere. I don’t think there is any good place for it in tracefs. So selinuxfs or debugfs might do? And I think it is
more useful to print what is denied than what is audited but that does not match the trace event name.
