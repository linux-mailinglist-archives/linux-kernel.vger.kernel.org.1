As far as I understand, the eBPF event emulation filter would be a
future-proof mechanism to simplify a lot of wine operations, so, fwiw it
seems an ideal mechanism for us.

If I understand correctly, though, the thunk idea is orthogonal to the
filter itself.  It could be used by the filter in the future
instead of SIGSYS, or we could support it as a sole mechanism to capture
everything.

As a first step, which would solve the existing Wine problem, would you
be open to the sole thunk support implementation, like you proposed?
This would allow us to move forward with this solution without waiting
for unprotected eBPF, and will still be useful in the future once we
get the entire eBPF filter model.

The interface could look like what you proposed, a prctl:

  prctl(PR_SET_SYSCALL_THUNK, target, address_of_unredirected_syscall, 0, 0, 0, 0);

This would immediately solve our use-case, and a few others. For
instance, I believe libsyscall-intercept could start to use that too.

I can explore a bit more, it could be combined to a personality that
enable/disable the thunk on wine entry points, if we notice that
filtering all syscalls in userspace is bad, but that is a second step
that might be unnecessary.
