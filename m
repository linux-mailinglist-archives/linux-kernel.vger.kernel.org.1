As far as I can see, this is the only place where probing 
_raw_spin_lock_irqsave() is an issue.  Should we blacklist all users for 
this case alone?

Not sure how you mean that. Jiri's RFC patch would be disabling 
k[ret]probes within kprobe_flush_task(), which is only ever invoked from 
finish_task_switch(). I only see calls to spin locks and kfree() from 
here. Besides, kprobe_flush_task() itself is NOKPROBE, so we would 
ideally want to not trace/probe other functions it calls.

I'm wondering if this actually works. kprobe_flush_task() seems to be 
called from finish_task_switch(), after the task switch is complete. So, 
current task won't actually be dead here.
