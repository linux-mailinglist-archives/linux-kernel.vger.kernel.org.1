Thanks for spending some time to help take a look at this as well.

The DRM documentation (at least at the time) seemed to imply that 
subclassing DRM private state was for legacy usage only and DRM wanted 
to move away from it. DRM private objects seemed to fit as the nicer 
atomic method for handling this since they have old/new, but as you can 
guess from this issue it's a mess (from our end).

The first step to fixing this is going back to subclassing DRM state.

It's actually the right tool for the job for allocating temporary state 
outside of the core DRM objects, and we need this to form the DC state 
object and necessary stream update bundles which might be too big to fit 
on the stack for commit check/commit tail. We'll be a lot closer to 
fixing the lockdep issues this way once we get around to getting rid of 
allocations in the DC commit paths.

The second step is to fix validation itself. The old state requirement 
for checking stream/plane updates was actually an entirely pointless 
endeavor since dc global validation doesn't every look at updates, just 
the final state for a set streams/planes - it's stateless.

We wanted to rely on DC to internally notify DM when DRM changes would 
do this, but DM actually requires this logic as well to know when to 
use a fast path vs a full programming path to recreate planes/streams 
based on the new DRM state to pass into validation.

State updates will change to be formed from a delta of the old/new plane 
state, but the new one can be discarded if not needed.

Any update that requires clock/bandwidth changes will have to add all 
the CRTCs and stall for any fast updates to complete first. This is 
because they could potentially reshuffle around the pipes as well, but 
these updates happen infrequently enough that the stall isn't too bad here.

DC state unfortunately still does need to exist due to requirements on 
hardware resources/pipe splitting that don't fit nicely into the DRM 
infrastructure. It's really hard to shift everything over into the DRM 
infrastructure as well because of the DKMS problem we chatted about 
briefly last year at XDC.

I'd really like to tackle a third step as well at some point, and that's 
cleaning up our IRQ management. Our interrupt handlers unfortunately 
access DRM state directly (since it's so easy to do) and thus introduce 
a requirement that it doesn't get changed while these are still enabled. 
This requires us to introduce our own stall checks in atomic_check and 
perform the interrupt disable in commit before the state swap.

The fix for this one isn't too bad, but it's tedious - copying all the 
state we need to the interrupt handlers before enabling them and letting 
them continue to work off of that state. This way we can remove the 
stall from atomic_check and actually disable/enable interrupts from 
commit_tail like we should be doing.

I've taken a look at that series but forgot to ACK. While this isn't the 
same thread for it, you can have my:

Reviewed-by: Nicholas Kazlauskas <nicholas.kazlauskas@amd.com>

...on the DC/DM bits. Everything you've identified there is correct and 
it's something I'd really like to get around to taking a look at by the 
end of the year, hopefully.

State allocations will be solved by the DM state allocation rework and 
the tiling flags thing needs to be solved by storing those in 
atomic_check instead on the plane.
