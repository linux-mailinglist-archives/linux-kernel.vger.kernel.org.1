OK, so from a quick look at that, my impression is that your display 
controller has its own MMU and you don't need to pretend to use the 
IOMMU API at all. Just have the DRM driver use io-pgtable directly to 
run its own set of ARM_32_LPAE_S1 pagetables - see Panfrost for an 
example (but try to ignore the wacky "Mali LPAE" format).

Robin.
