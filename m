This is a contradiction in terms, it is impossible to have a latency
regression is you don't care about the latency in this super slow path
to begin with.

Indeed they are.

Firmware is firmware, it's broken by design and we can't fix it if it's
broken. The only sane solution is not having firmware :-)

Again, nobody cares.

How is that not an administration problem?

Also, you shouldn't be able to change your affinity _to_ a CPU that's
going down. One of the very first steps in hotplug ensures that.
