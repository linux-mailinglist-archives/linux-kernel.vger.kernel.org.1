Currently here is already a bomb in mainline kernel.

This fuse_writepages_fill()->tree_insert() with num_pages == 0 corrupts fi->writepages tree.
Normally we have half-closed intervals in the tree:


         [5, 6)
        /      \
  [1, 3)        [7, 9)

But tree_insert(num_pages == 0) adds an abnormal interval with both ends included:

         [5, 5]
        /      \
  [1, 3)        [7, 9)


This may seriously confuse a reader iterating a tree, which does not know about special case (num_pages == 0).
As I see, nobody in the code cares about num_pages == 0, and there is no comment about that case.

This will fire soon or later. I think we should stop insert abnormal intervals (num_pages == 0) there.

Reasons fuse_writepages_fill() does use this (num_pages == 0)?!
