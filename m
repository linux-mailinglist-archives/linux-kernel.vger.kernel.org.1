NOTIFY_BAD should happen for rare cases only (mostly when 
rpmh_rsc_ctrlr_is_busy() returns true)

SC7180 has little and big CPUs. Both are powered by different power 
rail..in below scenario

1. All previos CPUs went into idle, the last CPU is big CPU which now 
notifying for idle.
2. The last CPU checked for rpmh_rsc_ctrlr_is_busy() and it returned 
false (meaning no ACTIVE transaction was in progress)
3. The last CPU is about to start rpmh_flush() now
4. Meanwhile any little CPU woken up and acquired cache_lock
5. The rpmh_flush() returns error (after trying to acquire cache_lock 
failed)
6. The last CPU (big CPU) in this case is still OK to goto idle, since 
it wasn't anymore really the last CPU

if we return NOTIFY_BAD, until big CPU re-tries and do all over again to 
reach here, the power rail for big CPUs is left powered ON.

we should let big CPU goto idle here (that will make power rail turn off 
since all big CPUs are idle leading to power savings) and leave it for 
little CPU to do rpmh_flush() when it goes idle.

The power savings will be less if above scenario happens on same CPU 
type (two big CPUs or two little CPUs), but can still be considerable.

For the reasons above.

I am yest to test this change but hitting NOTIFY_BAD is rare scenario 
and mostly should happen for last CPU only if detects 
rpmh_rsc_ctrlr_is_busy() is true.

It might in above scenario.
