Unlikely. Some benchmarking is needed, but the seccomp ptrace overhead is li=
kely *huge* compared to the overhead of just a filter.

As wild guess numbers on made up modern hardware, cache hot:

Empty syscall: 50ns, or 300ns with PTI

Empty syscall accepted by simple seccomp filter: 10ns more than an empty sys=
call without seccomp

Seccomp ptrace round trip: 6 us  Worse with PTI

Seccomp user notif round trip: 4 us

Syscall hypothetically redirected back to same process: about the same as an=
 empty filtered accepted syscall, plus however long it takes to run the hand=
ler. Add 900ns if using SIGSYS instead of plain redirection. Add an extra 50=
0ns on current kernels because signal delivery sucks, but I can fix this.

Take these numbers with a huge grain of salt.  But the point is that the BPF=
 part is the least of your worries.=
