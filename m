Mph, I had already forgotten your changes there. Is that really always the
case for newidle? In e.g. the busiest->group_type == group_fully_busy case,
I think we can pull more than one task.

IIRC Steve's implementation was to "simply" pull one task from any CPU
within the LLC domain that had > 1 runnable tasks. I quite like this since
picking any one task is almost always better than switching to the idle
task, but it wasn't a complete newidle_balance() replacement just yet.
