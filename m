Yeah this is another bug. And idea of isolate first, online and undoing
the isolation after zonelist and pcp struct update should work even for
the mentioned issue. This needs to go as a separate fix?

However, IMO, issue in free_pcppages_bulk() should be fixed by checking
if sane count value is passed. NO?
