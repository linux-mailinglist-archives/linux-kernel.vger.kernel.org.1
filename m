Stop using 'select MXC_CLK' when requiring the core library code?
Instead, make it a 'depends' and then that will make depending modules
(i.e. the SoC files) that want to be builtin force the core module to be
builtin too. Other modular configs that depend on the core will still be
modular.=20

I don't know why an architecture is selecting the clk code at all to be
honest. That can be moved to the defconfig instead of in the
architecture Kconfig and then you don't get a working system unless you
select the MXC_CLK config from the configurator tool (menuconfig,
nconfig, etc.) So ARCH_MXC shouldn't be in this discussion and the core
module should be selectable by the configurator and that should be
tristate and all SoC modules should depend on that core library module
and be selectable too and those Kconfigs can be tristate or bool.
