Yes, that is understood. The mhi_chan->mutex is only used to lock any 
channel
enable/start/stop/disable type operations, since these have to be in 
order, it
is essential that we wait for one of the operations to finish before the 
next
one.

Also we avoid a race, for example, at a time when a device crash forces 
a driver
"remove" call, while an operation to start/stop a channel is already 
going on.

So I am trying to follow the documentation style for other functions in 
the same
file. Is there any particular format you want me to refer to?

I use all spaces for the lines after the first one to align them just 
like the
rest of them.
