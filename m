Good that you ask. The discussion ended at the point that we do not have
a way to figure out what a syscall supports from user-space.  I talked a
bit with Christian about it and he mentioned that there were some ideas
floating around how to do that. At that point it made more sense to me
to wait for such a solution to appear before continuing the clone3()
time namespace work.
