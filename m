Subject: [PATCH tip/core/rcu 06/14] torture: Update initrd documentation
Date:   Mon, 31 Aug 2020 11:03:58 -0700

From: "Paul E. McKenney" <paulmck@kernel.org>

The rcu-test-image.txt documentation covers a very uncommon case where
a real userspace environment is required.  However, someone reading this
document might reasonably conclude that this is in fact a prerequisite.
In addition, the initrd.txt file mentions dracut, which is no longer used.
This commit therefore provides the needed updates.

+Normally, a minimal initrd is created automatically by the rcutorture
+scripting.  But minimal really does mean "minimal", namely just a single
+root directory with a single statically linked executable named "init":

+Suppose you need to run some scripts, perhaps to monitor or control
+some aspect of the rcutorture testing.  This will require a more fully
+filled-out userspace, perhaps containing libraries, executables for
+the shell and other utilities, and soforth.  In that case, place your
+desired filesystem here:
+
+	tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/initrd
+
+For example, your tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/initrd/init might
+be a script that does any needed mount operations and starts whatever
+scripts need starting to properly monitor or control your testing.
+The next rcutorture build will then incorporate this filesystem into
+the kernel image that is passed to qemu.
+
+Or maybe you need a real root filesystem for some reason, in which case
+please read on!
