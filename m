I understand that it may be used, in some way or the other to provide
a hint to the operating system to mount it in read-only mode.

Although, if there were a real security feature involved, the internal
FW of the SD card would also monitor the switch, to support read-only
mode. As I understand it, that's not the common case.

At this point, I prefer if you would ignore the write protect switch
in the SD controller driver.

According to Christoph, it should be possible to support read-only
mode via PCIe/NVMe. You may need to add some tweaks to support this in
the PCIe controller driver, but I can't advise you how to exactly do
this.

Perhaps you need to read/store the state of SD write-protect pin
before switching to SD express mode, because you may not be able to
read it beyond some point?

Thanks for trying to clarify.

However, this still doesn't explain to me, what *exactly* will happen
when rtsx_pci_card_exclusive_check() is called (or any other functions
in ->set_ios()).

In principle, "will not work" could mean that the calls to the
rtsx_pci_* cardreader interface hangs - and that would not be okay (as
it could lead to that the ->remove() callback hangs). So, either you
need to put a well written comment in the code about what will happen
- or add some kind of protection against potential problems for this.

Kind regards
Uffe
