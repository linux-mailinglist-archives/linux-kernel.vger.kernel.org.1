I saw Neil as the author and should have Cc'd him.

Neil, you can read my full email here:

Yeah, I really didn't expect an action item to come from this. It was
just some feedback, and perhaps you can use this as an example of "too
much markup" when dealing with others.

Looking at the web page that Matthew pointed out to, does make it much
easier to read. But one still needs to remember that a large audience
of this work is still those of us that will read the plain text.

My viewer of choice is "less" ;-)
