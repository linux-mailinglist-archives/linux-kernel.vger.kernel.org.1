I think the author should be the person whom prepared the patch.

Given that the downstream driver is a series of patches from a single
author it's not unreasonable to squash those and retain the author. But
if your effort to prepare the patch for upstream was non-trivial I would
consider it reasonable for you to claim authorship of the patch.

If this is the case it's definitely preferable to give credit to the
original author(s) by mentioning them in the commit message (e.g. "Based
on downstream implementation by Jane Doe").

And the copyright for the work definitely needs to come along, possibly
with the addition of yours, depending on your modifications.

Thanks,
Bjorn
