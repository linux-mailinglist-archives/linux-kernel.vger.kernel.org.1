Oh, yes, that will do it.

No, because it's racy (by itself).

GNU make uses pselect(), on systems that support it.  On systems that
don't support pselect() it uses a trick I described in another email:
we dup() the FD, read() on the dup, then in the SIGCHLD handler we
close() the dup.

It just feels cleaner to me to have the parent simply always take the
token, and leave it up to the child to put it back if appropriate,
rather than the parent putting it back.

Having the parent not acquire a token at all won't work; without
limiting sub-makes it means you might have 100's of them running at the
same time, even with -j2 or whatever.

I'm not sure I follow that?
