In Petko's patch, all needed ordering is supplied by the fact that it
is the same variable being read and written.  But yes, in many other
cases, more ordering is required.

And there are variables marked as volatile, for example, jiffies.

But one downside of declaring variables volatile is that it can prevent
KCSAN from spotting violations of the concurrency design for those
variables.

That too!  ;-)
