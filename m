Well, the fact the /some/ piece of software is used in production that
relies on the ill-defined EFI handover protocol is sufficient
justification, so I don't think it is hugely important to update it.

Thanks Arvind. I'm sure the Fedora/RedHat folks on cc should be able
to get these logged somewhere.
