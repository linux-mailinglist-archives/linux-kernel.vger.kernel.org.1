As you mentioned above, if memory is mapped as Normal Cacheable at Stage
2 (whether we use FWB or not), the guest is allowed to turn MTE on via
Stage 1. There is no way for KVM to prevent a guest from using MTE other
than the big HCR_EL2.ATA knob.

This causes potential issues since we can't guarantee that all the
Cacheable memory slots allocated by the VMM support MTE. If they do not,
the arch behaviour is "unpredictable". We also can't trust the guest to
not enable MTE on such Cacheable mappings.

On the host kernel, mmap'ing with PROT_MTE is only allowed for anonymous
mappings and shmem. So requiring the VMM to always pass PROT_MTE mapped
ranges to KVM, irrespective of whether it's guest RAM, emulated device,
virtio etc. (as long as they are Cacheable), filters unsafe ranges that
may be mapped into guest.

Note that in the next revision of the MTE patches I'll drop the DT
memory nodes checking and rely only on the CPUID information (arch
updated promised by the architects).

I see two possible ways to handle this (there may be more):

1. As in your current patches, assume any Cacheable at Stage 2 can have
   MTE enabled at Stage 1. In addition, we need to check whether the
   physical memory supports MTE and it could be something simple like
   pfn_valid(). Is there a way to reject a memory slot passed by the
   VMM?

2. Similar to 1 but instead of checking whether the pfn supports MTE, we
   require the VMM to only pass PROT_MTE ranges (filtering already done
   by the host kernel). We need a way to reject the slot and return an
   error to the VMM.

I think rejecting a slot at the Stage 2 fault time is very late. You
probably won't be able to do much other than killing the guest.

Both 1 and 2 above risk breaking existing VMMs just because they happen
to start on an MTE-capable machine. So, can we also require the VMM to
explicitly opt in to MTE support in guests via some ioctl()? This in
turn would enable the additional checks in KVM for the MTE capability of
the memory slots (1 or 2 above).

An alternative to an MTE enable ioctl(), if all the memory slots are set
up prior to the VM starting, KVM could check 1 or 2 above and decide
whether to expose MTE to guests (HCR_EL2.ATA).

More questions than solutions above, mostly for the KVM and Qemu
maintainers.

Thanks.
