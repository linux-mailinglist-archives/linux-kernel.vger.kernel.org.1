Will, Arnd and myself have been working on this since yesterday - we
_think_ it might have something to do with the clustering of the CPUs.
The LX2160A has 8 clusters of two CPUs. The Armada 8040 has two clusters
of two CPUs. RPi doesn't have clustering.

I've been able to reproduce it on the LX2160A with CPUs 0 and 15, or
CPUs 0 and 4. I haven't been able to reproduce it with CPUs 0 and 1.
However, contary to that, I haven't yet been able to reproduce it with
CPUs 0 and 2.

I've tried just plain "rw,errors=remount-ro" and the above.

Another bit of information I have just discovered - it's not Will's
commit. I reverted Will's commit, booted it on the gt8k system
yesterday. This morning, while checking the mount options there, I
noticed the rootfs had gone read only... checking the kernel log...

/dev/mmcblk0p1 contains a file system with errors, check forced.
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Inode 149495 passes checks, but checksum does not match inode.  Fix? no

So in this case, it looks like the inode has been written back to media
with a bad checksum... which is new.

Definitely "something else".

I've used 4.9.2 and then switched to 4.9.4. Will has built a kernel
using 4.9.4 which I'm about to try on the lx2160a.

I do _not_ want to try a later compiler and have this problem "vanish".
We will not know whether the problem has been hidden by different code
generation, but still actually exists.

As I've said, my confidence level with Aarch64 as a viable archtecture
is at rock bottom right now, and a definitive explanation needs to be
found for this, otherwise I'm going to dispose of *all* my Aarch64
hardware - I have no confidence anymore that the architecture is
capable of operating safely with modern Linux kernels, and I'd rather
use x86 instead right now. Yes, it this is _that_ serious a problem
for me.
