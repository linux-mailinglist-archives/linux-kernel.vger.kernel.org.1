"partial" is a count of partial slabs which simply sums per-numa counters.
Affected only "objects" and "objects_partial" which walk the list.

Yep, /proc/slabinfo also affected.

Actually it's more affected than sysfs - it walks all cgroups while sysfs shows only root.

Yep, "+" will break everything for sure.
I thought about returning "-1" or INT_MAX without counting,
but approximation gives almost correct result without breaking anything.

Each partial slab has at least one used and free object thus approximated
result will be somewhere between nr_partial_slabs and nr_partial_objects.

Nope, this is just a statistics for used/free objects.
Total count of objects and slabs are counted precisely.
