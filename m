The jbd debugging infrastructure dates back to the very beginnings of
ext3, when Stephen Tweedie added them while he was first implementing
the jbd layer.  So this dates back to a time before we had other
schemes like dynamic debug or tracepoints or eBPF.

I wonder if instead of trying to enhance our own bespoke debugging
system, instead we set up something like tracepoints where they would
be useful.  I'm not proposing that we try to replace all jbd_debug()
statements with tracepoints but I think it would be useful to look at
what sort of information would actually be *useful* on a production
server, and add those tracepoints to the jbd2 layer.  What I like
about tracepoints is you can enable them on a much more fine-grained
fashion; information is sent to userspace in a much more efficient
manner than printk; you can filter tracepoint events in the kernel,
before sending them to userspace; and if you want more sophisticated
filtering or aggregation, you can use eBPF.

What was the original use case which inspired this?  Were you indeed
trying to debug some kind of problem on a production system?  (Why did
you have multiple disks active at the same time?)  Was there a
specific problem you were trying to debug?  What debug level were you
using?  Which jbd_debug statements were most useful to you?  Which
just got in the way (but which had to be enabled given the log level
you needed to get the debug messages that you needed)?
