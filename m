Yes, I know that :)

Sure, but if you can build a Thumb-2 vDSO object for arch/arm/ using then
we should be able to build a Thumb-2 compat vDSO for arch/arm64, and your
patch is papering over a deeper issue. Generally, having the compat vDSO
behave differently to the arch/arm/ vDSO is indicative of something being
broken.

In other words, if your patch was correct (not sure that it is) then I
would expect a corresponding change to arch/arm/ to pass -marm when
CONFIG_THUMB2_KERNEL=y. Make sense?
