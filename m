I'm glad to have learned something new. ACPI was mostly a magic black

Yeah, that's the solution I had in mind as well and should hopefully be
fine. Until ASUS ships a device with yet another weird firmware quirk,
anyway.

I've tested the patch on the laptop applied on top of 5.8.8 and it works
as it should!

The patch itself looks good to me, but I have one tiny nitpick: A typo
in my name on line 15. I feel bad for even mentioning that though.

I'm glad we are able to resolve the issue so quickly. I was going to say
that the report on bugzilla should be addressed also, but I see you have
already done that. Thank you for kindly your work.

Regards,
Samuel
