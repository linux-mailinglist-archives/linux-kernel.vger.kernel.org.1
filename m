Please check the section 4.5.1.2 (Connecting Sources and Sinks). Check
the typical flow. You can also check the Connection State Machine
Requirements. The order should be clear from those as well.

1. Source/sink detection
2. Orientation
3. Data role
4. VCONN
5. VBUS (USB Type-C currents)
6. The connector is now configured. We can start the PD communication
   that should lead into configuration of the mux if we enter a mode.

The data role, the thing that we are talking about here, really should
be set before the mux is configured.

The TCPM does not execute the steps that configure the port on this
platform. The OS is the part that actually executes the steps.

That is one reason (but not the only one) why it is important that
both parts follow the order that is proposed in the spec. Otherwise we
may endup negotiating things with the partner in one order but then
actually executing those steps in some other.
