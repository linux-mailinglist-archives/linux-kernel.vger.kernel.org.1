Hmm, apologies if I got the wrong end of the stick here - this prose
and the naming of some of the crypto_hkdf_xxx routines and function
pointers in the test code made me think that this is more than it
actually is.

What we are talking about are basically library wrappers around shash
instances to perform HKDF, right?
