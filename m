Correct, this is just an enforcement as we are going to rely on the 
availability of drvdata->csdev to access the device with the
introduction of abstraction. This is why we WARN_ON() as we should
never hit this case.

The CPU PM notifier is registered with the probing of the first ETM
device. Now, another ETM device could be probed (on a different CPU
than the parent of this ETM). Now, there is a very narrow window of
time between :

1) Initialise etmdrvdata[cpu]

2) Register the coresight_device for the ETM.(i.e, coresight_register()).

If the CPU is put on idle, after (1) and before (2), we end up with

drvdata->csdev == NULL.

This is unacceptable and there is no need to take an action in
such case. This patch fixes the potential problem, also making
sure that we have the access methods available when we need it.
(drvdata->csdev->access)

I will add it to the commit message.

Cheers
Suzuki
