Hello Mark,

Thanks for applying the commit, however, I feel like reminding you that 
setting voltage on this regulator without setting a current limit is 
really unsafe (at least, from many, many experiments) so, to ensure the 
entire safety of this code and the hardware that's attached to these 
regulators you should, please, either apply the entire series, or nothing.

My concerns are only about keeping LAB and IBB safe for everyone's hardware.

Thank you again
-- Angelo
