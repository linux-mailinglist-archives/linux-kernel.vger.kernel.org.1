The psABI says (1) can be relaxed into mov $foo, %reg if PIC is disabled
and foo lives below 4Gb. Similarly for the "test and binop" cases. Such
a relaxation would produce code that's not PIC any more, and wouldn't
boot.

It ought to be faster: according to Agner Fog's tables, upto 4x higher
throughput than the RIP-relative LEA, and movq $foo, %rax is actually
the same size.

To take a step back, there isn't any *point* in not specifying -pie
after these changes: it would be lying to the toolchain just for the
sake of lying. It is inherently fragile, and would work only because the
toolchain isn't sophisticated enough to do some optimizations.

Eg, consider that if you ask for the address of an external function,
the compiler will generate
	movq f@GOTPCREL(%rip), %reg
if f has default visibility, and
	leaq f(%rip), %reg
if f has hidden visibility.

If you then link without -pie, the former gets relaxed into the non-PIC
	movq $f, %reg
by the BFD linker, but the latter isn't relaxed. This is a missed
optimization, which happens because there's the GOTPCRELX to tell the
linker that the first form can be relaxed, and there's no special
relaxable relocation type for the second form.

The 64-bit kernel actually contains one of these relocations, prior to
Ard's patches to add hiddden visibility for everything. It currently
works with LLD (which can't use -pie) only because LLD doesn't appear to
perform the relaxation of
	movq f@GOTPCREL(%rip), %reg
all the way to
	movq $f, %reg
Binutils-2.34, which does do that relaxation, produces an unbootable
kernel if you leave out the -pie.
