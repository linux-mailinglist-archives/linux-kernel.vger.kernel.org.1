Thanks! I've got 16*TREE03 running since this morning, so far so nothing :/
(FWIW that's 16/9 times overcommit, idle time fluctuates around 10%).

target or source ? Either would be possible, perhaps even both. We have
a spare u32 in __call_single_node.

Something like the below on top of 1-4. If we want to keep this, we
should probably stick it under some CONFIG_DBUG thing or other.
