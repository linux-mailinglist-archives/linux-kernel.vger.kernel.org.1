Yes, it is in the PE/COFF specification. [0]

The whole problem is that we are conflating 'loading a PE/COFF image'
with 'copying a PE/COFF image into memory', which are not the same
thing. It is not just the layout issue, we are running into other
problems with things like UEFI secure boot and TPM-based measured
boot, where the fact that omitting the standard LoadImage() boot
service (which takes care of these things under the hood) means that
you now have to do your own checks and measurements. These things are
literally all over the place at the moment, shim, GRUB, systemd-boot
etc, with no authoritative spec that describes which component should
be doing what.

Commit ec93fc371f014a6fb483e3556061ecad4b40735c has the background, but ...

... I'll look into updating the documentation as well. Note that this
stuff is hot off the press, so there may be some issues lurking (like
this one) that we hadn't thought of yet.

OVMF and u-boot already have implementations of this initrd loading
approach. A GRUB version is under discussion.

Actually, it may be sufficient to #define __efistub_global to
__section(.data) like we already do for ARM, to ensure that these
global flags are always initialized correctly. (I'll wait for Sergey
to confirm that the spurious enabling of the PCI DMA protection
resulting from this BSS issue is causing the boot regression)
