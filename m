Yes, that's the best for now. My gut feeling is that the fault Jason is
seeing didn't happen on a vmalloc address, but I can't prove that yet.

And if this is true it means that more work is needed before the syncing
on x86-64 can be removed, so reverting is the best for now.

Jason, can you share more details about the test setup which triggers
this? Like the .config and the machine setup, ideally a qemu
command-line, and how to reproduce it on that setup.

Thanks,

	Joerg
