It appears to me the reason could be because the higher priority task is RT:

sched_switch: prev_comm=lock_torture_wr prev_pid=74 prev_prio=139 prev_state=R+ ==> next_comm=lock_torture_wr next_pid=70 next_prio=49

After this, only pid=70 runs till the hungtasks detector screams.

Could this because the writer calls cur_ops->task_boost(); which sets pid=70
to RT?  As long as RT task runs, it will block the CFS task without giving it CPU.

thanks,
