Well, this is what I had asked about originally, I assumed that
Florian had asked someone with access to the datasheet.

That's not how dma-ranges work, they tell you what the capabilities
of the bus are, while the capabilities of the device are identified by
the properties of that device.

The device claims to be compatible with "generic-xhci", so the
driver asks for a 64-bit mask to be set according to the xhci
specification. If this device is not xhci compliant, then it should
not ask for a 64-bit mask.

However, if this is a 64-bit capable bus master on a 32-bit bus,
then the dma-ranges property should list the capabilities of the
bus, so the kernel can force the driver to fall back to 32-bit addressing.
