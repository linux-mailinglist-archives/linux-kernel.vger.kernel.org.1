I'm not entirely sure that's the case. This report still points at the
old commit fa6726c1e7 which has:

+       depends on ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE || EXPERT
+       default n if !ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE
+       default y if DEBUG_VM

In -next we now have commit 647d9a0de34c and subsequently modified by
commit 0a8646638865. So hopefully with the latest -next tree we won't
see this report.

We could as well remove the 'depends on ... || EXPERT' part but I'd
rather leave this around with a default n (as in current -next) in case
others want to have a go. If that's still causing problems, we can
remove the '|| EXPERT' part, so there won't be any further regressions.
