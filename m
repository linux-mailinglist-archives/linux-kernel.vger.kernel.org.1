I'd say free form is easier to manage. Being in the list of valid triggers
doesn't mean the kernel actually has support for it enabled.

Is changing this after it has been in some kernel releases OK? Wouldn't
it be considered a break of sysfs ABI?

Also, is there some guideline on how to name the labels? For sunxi we've
been doing "${vendor}:${color}:${function}" since forever.

As far as I can tell, the hardware vendor [1] has no specific uses for
these two (red and yellow) LEDs designed in. And their GPIO lines are
simply labeled "DIY" (for the red one) and "YELLOW". So I'm not sure
if putting "our" interpretations and the default-trigger into the
label is wise.

For reference, the green one has its GPIO line labeled "WORK", and their
intention from [1] is to have it as some sort of power / activity indicator.
Hence it is named / labeled "work".

As for the node names, I think we can keep it as is for now. It's not
the preferred form, but there's really no need to change it either.
And some overlay or script might actually expect that name.

ChenYu
