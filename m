Hello

I think adding a small number of instructions to preempt_schedule_irq()
is sufficient to create the needed protected region between the start
of a function and the trampoline body.

preempt_schedule_irq() {
+  if (unlikely(is_trampoline_page(page_of(interrupted_ip)))) {
+      return; // don't do preempt schedule
+
+  }
  preempt_schedule_irq() original body
}

// generated on trampoline pages
trace_trampoline() {
   preempt_disable();
   trace_trampoline body
   jmp preempt_enable_traced(clobbers)
}

asm(kernel text):
preempt_enable_traced:
   preempt_enable_notrace();
   restore cobblers
   return(the return ip on the stack is traced_function_start_code)


If the number of instructions added in preempt_schedule_irq() and
the complexity to make trampoline ip detectable(is_trampoline_page(),
or is_trampoline_range()) are small, and tasks_rcu is rendered useless,
I think it will be win-win.

Thanks
