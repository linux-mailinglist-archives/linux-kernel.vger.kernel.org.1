I'd agree, but the NFS case was in use before, and when the original
deferred timeout/optional link handling stuff landed no one complained
they were broken by it (at least at the point where it landed). Only
later when we started enabling more lower-level core drivers as
modules did the shortened dependency resolution time start to bite
folks.  My attempt to set the default to be 30 seconds helped there,
but caused trouble and delays for the NFS case, and "don't break
existing users" seemed to rule, so I set the default timeout back to
0.

I agree that would be preferred. But kernel parameters are often there
for these sorts of cases where we can't always do the right thing.  As
for out-of-tree patches, broken things don't get fixed until
out-of-tree patches are developed and upstreamed, and I know Saravana
is doing exactly that, and I hope his fw_devlink work helps fix it so
the module loading is not just a matter of luck.

Also I think Thierry's comments in the other thread today are also
good ideas for ways to better handle the optional dt link handling
(rather than using a timeout).
