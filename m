As I said in my mail, looking at the codepath it seems safe. My question
was whether it is _always_ incorrectly false which I do think it is
because child subreapers can't come from outside the pid namespace. If
they could you could create a scenario where the signal is generated
from a sibling pid namespace in which case it would be correctly set to
true.
