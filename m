+Hardware tag-based KASAN
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Hardware tag-based KASAN is similar to the software mode in concept, but uses
+hardware memory tagging support instead of compiler instrumentation and
+shadow memory.
+
+Hardware tag-based KASAN is based on both arm64 Memory Tagging Extension (MTE)
+introduced in ARMv8.5 Instruction Set Architecture, and Top Byte Ignore (TBI).
+
+Special arm64 instructions are used to assign memory tags for each allocation.
+Same tags are assigned to pointers to those allocations. On every memory
+access, hardware makes sure that tag of the memory that is being accessed is
+equal to tag of the pointer that is used to access this memory. In case of a
+tag mismatch a fault is generated and a report is printed.
