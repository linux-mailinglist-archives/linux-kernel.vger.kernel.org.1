Yeah, if we want to be really precise then you are right, nothing like
that is really feasible for the reclaim. Reclaiming 1 page might be much
more expensive than 100 pages because LRU order doesn't reflect the
cost of the reclaim at all. What, I believe, we want is a best effort,
really. If the reclaim target is somehow bound to the requested amount
of memory then we can at least say that more memory hungry consumers are
reclaiming more. Which is something people can wrap their head around
much easier than a free competition on the reclaim with some hard to
predict losers who do all the work and some lucky ones which just happen
to avoid throttling by a better timing. Really think of the direct
reclaim and how the unfairness suck there.
