Better, although the later paragraph still seems rather vague to me.
Compare to:

Currently when a driver provides both polling I/O and a console then kdb
will output using the console. We can increase robustness by using the
currently active polling I/O driver (which should be lockless) instead
of the corresponding console. For several common cases (e.g. an
embedded system with a single serial port that is used both for console
output and debugger I/O) this will result in no console handler being
used.

Agree.

Note that this is all I ever expected to look at when I commented about
before.

IIUC you mean that the logic to match devices only works for tty drivers
and there examples are not tty drivers.

This could probably be solved but no need to get too tied in knots. It's
fine to keep the is_console check for now.

However rather than replicate the polled I/O write code a third and
fourth time lets get the I/O logic pulled out into proper functions.
