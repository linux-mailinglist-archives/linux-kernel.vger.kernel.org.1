Interesting!

Unfortunate

Right, IMHO the right approach is to abstract away these details and use
whatever PE has to offer.

Agreed.

Right, one thing I'd ask is for you to add to the tree a very simple PE
file, with debug info, a build-id, and then introduce a new 'perf test'
entry that uses the functions you're adding to read and check its
whatever the build-id is there, so that we keep testing this regularly,
please take a look at tools/perf/tests/ to see how to add a new test.

Thanks for working on this, right now I'm doing the final touches for
this merge window, but surely I'll get back to this for 5.9, please
remind me if this falls thru the cracks,
