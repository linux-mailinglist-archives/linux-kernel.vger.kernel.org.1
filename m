Thomas' point isn't that your code needs to be reviewed, it's that trying
to squeeze it into the initial merge will, not might, _will_ push out the
acceptance of SGX.  The same is true for other features we have lined up,
e.g. KVM and cgroup support.  It's not a slight on your code, it's just
reality at this point.

Personally, I'm in favor of adding a reserved placeholder for a token so
as to avoid adding a second ioctl() in the event that something gets
upstreamed that wants the token.  Ditto for a file descriptor for the
backing store in sgx_enclave_create.

But, I have contributed exactly zero ioctls to the kernel, so take that
with a big block of salt :-)

Modularizing the the driver does nothing for your use case.  The "driver"
is a relatively lightweight wrapper, removing that is akin to making
/dev/sgx/enclave inaccessible, i.e. it doesn't make the EPC tracking and
core code go away.  Modularizing the whole thing is flat out not an option,
as doing so is not compatible with an EPC cgroup and adds unnecessary
complexity to KVM enabling, both of which are highly desired features by
pretty much everyone that plans on using SGX.

Andy is right to caution against playing games to squish in-kernel things,
but the virtualization snafu is a completely different beast.  E.g. SGX
doesn't require fiddling with CR4, won't corrupt random memory across
kexec(), doesn't block INIT, etc...  And I'm not advocating long-term
shenanigans, I just wanted to point out that there are options for running
out-of-tree drivers in the short term, e.g. until proper policy controls
land upstream.
