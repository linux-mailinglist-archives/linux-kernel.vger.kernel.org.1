This will reduce the chance of stalls but the interface is still
non-delegatable i.e. applications can not change their own memory.high
for the use-cases like application controlled proactive reclaim and
uswapd.

One more ugly fix would be to add one more layer of cgroup and the
application use memory.high of that layer to fulfill such use-cases.

I think providing a new interface would allow us to have a much
cleaner solution than to settle on a bunch of ugly hacks.

This patch seems reasonable on its own.
