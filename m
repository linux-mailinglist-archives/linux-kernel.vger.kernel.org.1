For example, if the tracking object is a task struct, it would save call traces for the first and last call of both get_task_struct() and put_task_struct(). Then, it could be expanded to track other refcount-based leaks in the future.

> Another issue that might be relevant is that it seems sometimes, kmemleak will give a lot of false positives (hundreds) because the memory was supposed to be freed by call_rcu()  (for example, in dst_release()) but for some reasons, it takes a long time probably waiting for grace periods or some kind of RCU self-stall, but the memory had already became an orphan. I am not sure how we are going to resolve this properly until we have to figure out why call_rcu() is taking so long to finish?

I know nothing about kmemleak, but I won't let that stop me from making
random suggestions...

One approach is to do an rcu_barrier() inside kmemleak just before
printing leaked blocks, and check to see if any are still leaked after
the rcu_barrier().

If kmemleak works on crash dumps, another approach is to scan RCU's
callback lists.  This will miss those callbacks that rcu_do_batch()
was in the middle of invoking, though.  It also misses cases where
someone passes a linked structure to call_rcu(), and then frees the
structure piece by piece within the callback function.

> Another solution is to add aux call traces for both skb_dst_drop() and skb_dst_set() for this case, but that there are many places to free memory via call_rcu() like inode free etc.

And call_rcu() has no idea where the memory starts.  And again, sometimes
there is memory linked from that passed to call_rcu() that will be freed
by the callback function.

In theory, these linked-structure cases could be handled by checking
the callback function and then traversing the links.  I wouldn't be
that ambitious, but don't let me discourage you.  ;-)
