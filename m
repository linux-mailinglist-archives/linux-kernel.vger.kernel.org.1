greylisting was originally pioneered by email.  It's where you
initially reject an email but remember you did so and then let it
through if the retries follow an RFC mandated pattern.  The technical
use spread from there since the technique (treating something as
untrusted until it proves trust) is very useful.  It has its origin in
the English idiom "grey area" expressing doubt or lack of clarity.

The etymology of "grey area" is a grey area, but I'd bet it has to do
with not having the clarity of black and white ... but is equally
likely to be tied to Yin and Yang.  Grey is also used in England to
describe the lack of clarity given by mist or fog (he woke up and saw
the world was very grey).  I'd say we just leave it alone as too
distantly related to any problematic uses.
