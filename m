Should it turn out that we can in fact go into the allocator, completely
agreed.

In the single-argument kvfree_rcu() case, completely agreed.

The extra cache misses are a problem in that case because they throttle
the reclamation, which anti-throttles the producer, especially in the
case where callback invocation is offloaded.
