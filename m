Yeah, I meant the Qt one (qconfig).

Try to switch between the several modes and switch back. There used to
have several broken things there, because the Qt5 port was incomplete.

One of the things that got fixed on the Qt5 fixup series is the helper
window at the bottom. It should now have the same behavior as with the
old Qt3/Qt4 version.

Basically, on split mode, it should have 3 screen areas:

	+------------+-------+
	|            |       |
	| Config     |  menu |
	|            |       |
	+------------+-------+
	|                    |
	| Config description +
	|                    |
	+--------------------+

The contents of the config description should follow up any changes at 
the "menu" part of the split mode, when an item is selected from "menu",
or follow what's selected at "config", when the active window is "config".

The Kernel 3.14 conversion broke the "config description", and caused
several other issues.

When the config description area got fixed, I had to fix each of the
modes, for all of them to update the right area at the screen, as they
were pointing to the wrong places on several parts of the code.

You should also be able to see the helper window at the bottom changing
as modes change.

Anyway, the patch I just sent should fix it.

> Could you check that you also have the issue with search in qconf/xconfig?

Yeah, before that patch, search was working only on the two other
modes.

Btw, I'm also using Fedora here (Fedora 32). So, I should have a
result close to what you would be experiencing.

Thanks,
Mauro
