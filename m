Sorry for the long delay. I was busy on a project and missed some mail.
I did receive some feedback about typo or coding style before, so i was expecting
more comment about the logic or people just don't care about these. After all,
this issue has lived a very long time.

It's a good news to hear that Will has plan to solve these issues, i will
follow that to do my bit.
Before that, i can send the next version in this week.


Thanks,
Wei
