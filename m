Understood.

Thanks for sharing the status from ARM32.  Is there any available branch
already?  It would be good to have a reference implementation.

After some survey I found previous disccusion
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/24/2110). The 5.2-based patch ended up not
being merged.  But at least we will have something to start if we want to.

Also interestingly, there was a PR for privileged spec that separates
addressing modes (https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/pull/128) as
Sdas extension, but there was no progress afterwards.

Not very related to this thread, but there were some discussion about
ASID design in RISC-V (https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/issues/348).
It is now in ratified 1.11 privileged spec.

It seems to me that VMSPLIT_4G_4G is quite different from other VMSPLITs,
because it requires much more changes.

Thanks for showing the stance of kernel community against HIGHMEM support.
The cited discussion thread is comprehensive and clear.  Despite that RV32
users cannot get upstream support for their large memory, mechnisms like
VMSPLIT_4G_4G seems to be a promising way to go.  That being said, to
support the theoretical 16G physical memory, eventually kmap* will still
be needed.
