True, but in the case of SPMI controller and PMIC, there's no way
to support them to be initialized on a random order.

That's why the approach I took is serializing the probe.

There's no need for them to come up on a particular order.

What I meant to say is that the that the SPMI controller and MFD
should go first.

- 

Yet, incidentally, the current code also serializes the regulator
probe. I could have written the code on a different way that
would allow them to be probed in parallel, by moving a loop
from the regulator driver to the PMIC one. However, I don't see any 
advantage on doing that, as the regulator initialization code ends 
calling the SPMI serial bus, whose access is already serialized by 
a spinlock.

So, there's no performance gain by allowing them to be probed
in parallel, as most of the regulator's probing time is probably
waiting for the relatively slow I/O serial transfers to happen. 

Also, a nice a side effect of serializing the probe at the 
regulator driver is that the devices are ordered according
their LDO numbers, and the debug logs from probing time will
be altogether, helping to debug potential issues over there.

Good point. I'll do a review at the printks inside the driver anyway.

I'll try to cleanup some things that doesn't make much sense
after having the driver working properly.


Thanks,
