Which series ?

It seems you sent 3 times, at 9:29, 9:41 and 9:49 (Paris Time)

 From the series of 9:29, I received patches 0 to 3
 From the series of 9:41, I received patches 0 to 3
 From the series of 9:49, I received patches 0 and 4.

Looks like powerpc patchwork 
(https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?submitter=78320) 
got:
 From the series of 9:29, I received patches 0 to 4
 From the series of 9:41, I received patches 1 to 4
 From the series of 9:49, I received patches 1 to 4

So this seems to be something wrong somewhere.
