hi martin

sorry for cc -problem it was my fault in thunderbird

thanks for dtb file but this file has problem kernel stop with

[    6.122092] mmc0: new high speed SDIO card at address 0001
[   35.804258] VCCK: disabling
[   35.808781] platform pwmleds: deferred probe pending
[   35.812625] platform sound: deferred probe pending

[  215.804295] random: crng init done

(last time deferred probe was gcc problem )

please can you provide me with dts file and i complile at my linux box 
or maybe only the change line and i use the dtb from image and edit the 
lines like the usb patch

thanks

Tobias
