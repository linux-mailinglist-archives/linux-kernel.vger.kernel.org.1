Hmm, isn't that really a bug in the DVFS code? I guess it's just blindly 
propagating -EINVAL from the fixed regulators not implementing 
set_voltage, but AFAICS it has no real excuse not to be cleverer and 
still allow switching frequency as long as the voltage *is* high enough 
for the given OPP. I wonder how well it works if the regulator is 
programmable but shared with other consumers... that case probably can't 
be hacked around in DT.
