I would argue that it only make sense to complicate it if it is useful most of the time which I never feel or hear that is the case. This reminds me your recent call_rcu() stacks that most of time just makes parsing the report cumbersome. Thus, I urge this exercise to over-engineer on special cases need to stop entirely.

Adding kernel config options is just another way to add complications with real
cost. The only other way I can think of right now is to create some kinds of
plugin systems for kasan to be able to run ebpf scripts (for example) to deal
with those special cases.
