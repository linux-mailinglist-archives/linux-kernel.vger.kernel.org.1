Adding "Automatic" option that just defaults to "Full" in gma500 does
not break existing userspace, but allows for extending it to do more
clever things later.

I'm obviously biased and predisposed to avoid adding extra complexity to
i915 when it's not necessary. We'd have *two* connector properties for
the same thing until the end of time, even if one is an alias for the
other.
