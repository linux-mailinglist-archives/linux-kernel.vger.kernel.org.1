The other outport of swao replicator is connected to EUD which is a
QCOM specific HW which can be used as a sink like USB.
And the other outport of other replicator(replicator_out) is connected 
to
TPIU.

Added some prints in replicator_probe.

  replicator probe ret=-517 devname=6046000.replicator idfilter0=0x0 
idfilter1=0x0
  replicator probe ret=0 devname=6b06000.replicator idfilter0=0xff 
idfilter1=0xff
  replicator probe ret=0 devname=6046000.replicator idfilter0=0xff 
idfilter1=0xff

Sounds good to me, Mike would have some comments.
