To be clear this stuff is all for when we're running on the PowerVM machines,
ie. as LPARs.

That brings with it a bunch of problems, such as existing software that
has been developed/configured for Power8 and expects to see SMT8.

We also allow LPARs to be live migrated from Power8 to Power9 (and back), so
maintaining the illusion of SMT8 is considered a requirement to make that work.

Yeah I agree the naming is confusing.

Let's call them "SMT4 cores" and "SMT8 cores"?

It's partly users, but also software that would see different values depending
on where it looks.

Agreed, though as you say there aren't that many that actually use the low-level
topology information.

The problem is we are already lying to userspace, because firmware lies to us.

ie. the firmware on these systems shows us an SMT8 core, and so current kernels
show SMT8 to userspace. I don't think we can realistically change that fact now,
as these systems are already out in the field.

What this patch tries to do is undo some of the mess, and at least give the
scheduler the right information.

cheers
