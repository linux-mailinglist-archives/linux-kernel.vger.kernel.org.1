I did not mean that you should restrict the routing ability of your SoC,
quite the opposite actually.

You should just expose it correctly

From the diagram above, each comp (ASMAIFs, BE even the XBAR) should
export AIF_IN/AIF_OUT widgets. Think of those as the interfaces of your
components.

The connections between those interfaces are fixed, the
represent what the HW is (IOW, the wires). They could possibly be
described in DT (audio-routing prop)

The XBAR should implement the N to M MUX and export all the necessary
kcontrols to act it. The routing magic happens in this component.
There is no limit to the flexibility this provides, unless you set one
;)

If you implement the XBAR capability in the comp, not a use case, there
is no reason to change it.

DT describes the HW, changing it to describe a use case means something
is wrong, usually.

Exactly, your XBAR comp should provide the widget(s) and related
kcontrol(s).

From you description, you XBAR should not have DAIs, just DAPM widgets
and kcontrols

Precisely.
I have been using the same method on Amlogic cards.
