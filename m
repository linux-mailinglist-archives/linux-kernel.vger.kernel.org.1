Thanks, I stole your patch and extended/tweaked it a little. Would you
mind providing your Signed-off-by:?

I didn't actually change anything user-visible, just the internal name
of the counters:

static const unsigned int memcg1_stats[] = {
	NR_FILE_PAGES,		/* was MEMCG_CACHE */
	NR_ANON_MAPPED,		/* was MEMCG_RSS */
	NR_ANON_THPS,		/* was MEMCG_RSS_HUGE */
	NR_SHMEM,
	NR_FILE_MAPPED,
	NR_FILE_DIRTY,
	NR_WRITEBACK,
	MEMCG_SWAP,
};

static const char *const memcg1_stat_names[] = {
	"cache",
	"rss",
	"rss_huge",
	"shmem",
	"mapped_file",
	"dirty",
	"writeback",
	"swap",
};

Or did you refer to something else?
