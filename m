Ok I'm going to rebase it.

Sure, I'm always glad to remove lines!

Ok, I'm checking that.

Ok.

It probably started with a brainfart that I elaborated a bit too far. Let me check
that again.

Indeed I should rename it to nocb_gp_check_rdp() or something.

Because the comment only concerns the locking?

Ok.

Ah, ok noted.
