Not really, on PVH dom0 we should be able to identity map the required
EFI regions in the dom0 p2m, so the only difference between a classic
PV dom0 is that we need to assure that those regions are correctly
identity mapped in the p2m, but that shouldn't require any change to
the SystemTable unless we need to craft custom tables (see below).

AFAICT it needs to be written for EFI. For the purposes here I think
you could copy the SystemTable and modify the NumberOfTableEntries and
ConfigurationTable fields in the copy in order to delete the ESRT if
found to be placed in a non suitable region?

At that point we can remove the checks from Linux since Xen will
assert that whatever gets passed to dom0 is in a suitable region. It
would be nice to have a way to signal that the placement of the ESRT
has been checked, but I'm not sure how to do this, do you have any
ideas?

Roger.
