DRM drivers can't go through staging unless you get the DRM developers
to agree with it, and last I heard, they were strongly against it.

It's _always_ faster to just do the work out-of-tree for a week or so
and then merge it correctly to the proper part of the kernel tree.  I'd
recommend doing that here for the iommu driver, as well as the DRM
driver.

There's no issues with authorship and the like, just properly attribute
it when you submit it and you are fine.

Again, merging in staging always takes more work and energy, don't do it
unless there is no other way.
