  Merge remote-tracking branch 'regulator/for-5.9' into regulator-next (2020-07-30 23:27:08 +0100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
regulator: Updates for v5.9

This time around the bulk of the work on the regulator API has been
cleanups of various kinds, partly but not entirely inspired by the W=1
stuff that 0day turned on.  There's also been a fairly large crop of new
drivers, and a few bugfixes for existing drivers.

 - Mode setting support for MT6397 and DA9211.
 - New drivers for ChromeOS embedded controllers, Fairchild FAN53880,
   NXP PCA9450, Qualcomm LABIBB, MP5496, and VBUS booster, and Silergy
   SY8827N
