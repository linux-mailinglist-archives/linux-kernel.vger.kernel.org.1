So I've tried to think of a race that could produce that and here is
the only thing I could come up with. It's a bit complicated unfortunately:

CPU 0                                              CPU 1
-----                                              -----

tick {
    trigger_load_balance() {
        raise_softirq(SCHED_SOFTIRQ);
        //but nohz_flags(0) = 0
    }
                                                   kick_ilb() {
                                                       atomic_fetch_or(...., nohz_flags(0))
    softirq() {                                        #VMEXIT or anything that could stop a CPU for a while
        run_rebalance_domain() {
            nohz_idle_balance() {
                atomic_andnot(NOHZ_KICK_MASK, nohz_flag(0))
            }
         }
     }
}

// schedule
nohz_newidle_balance() {
    kick_ilb() { // pick current CPU
        atomic_fetch_or(...., nohz_flags(0))           #VMENTER
        smp_call_function_single_async() {             smp_call_function_single_async() {
            // verified csd->flags != CSD_LOCK             // verified csd->flags != CSD_LOCK
            csd->flags = CSD_LOCK                          csd->flags = CSD_LOCK
            //execute in place                             //queue and send IPI
            csd->flags = 0
            nohz_csd_func()
	}
    }
}


IPI�{
    flush_smp_call_function_queue() {
        csd_unlock() {
            WARN_ON(csd->flags != CSD_LOCK) <---------!!!!!



The root cause here would be that trigger_load_balance() unconditionally raise
the softirq. And I have to confess I'm not clear why since the softirq is
essentially a no-op when nohz_flags() is 0.

Thanks.
