Your point is clear.

Allowing a W=0 warning into my pull-request was a genuine mistake
(most of us are only human after all).  It will be treated as a
learning point, safeguards will be put into place at my end and this
situation should not be repeated in the future.

I shall continue with my W=1 push (not going to touch W=2s however).
It's understandable that to you W=0s are paramount, but as long as
none are introduced then fixing up W=1s can only help to improve the
code-base (not withstanding 'type-limits' of course!) and ensure it's
more in sync/aligned with itself [thinking API documentation warnings
here]).

Thanks for pulling though.  It is appreciated.

Apologies again for the fuss.
