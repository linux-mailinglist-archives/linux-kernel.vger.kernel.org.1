However, to me it seems the approach has been "clang doesn't like X,
the kernel has to change to suit clang" - sometimes at the expense
of either functionality or maintainability of the kernel.

Some of the changes have been good (provoking modernisation) but that's
not true of everything - and I see nothing happening subsequently to
rectify the situation.

Had we gone down the path of disabling the build of iWMMXT, if anyone
builds a kernel with clang for ARMv5 PXA and relies on iWMMXT, their
userspace suddenly breaks because they used a different compiler and
lost the necessary iWMMXT support in the kernel to allow userspace to
operate, which isn't a nice approach.

Using macros is the best solution to work around clang, but should not
be done at the expense of GNU AS which has proper support.

I'd say this: if clang wants to support building ARMv5, then it needs
to support iWMMXT and stop forcing the kernel to adapt to Clang's
incomplete implementations (which are no direct fault of the clang
developers.)
