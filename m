That's correct, Bjorn/Andy, can these be pulled in now for 5.9?
They have acks from Greg for serial and Mark for the spi patch.

Correct, the dsi patch is still not reviewed by Rob, so once that's done,
I am guessing Rob would pull both of these.

correct, this is pending review/ack from Stan.

Right, Mark has this acked, I am guessing he will pull this in at
some point.
