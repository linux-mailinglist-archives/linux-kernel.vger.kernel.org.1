Agreed. I just showed that as example and was hoping to use some nice
kstr* APIs to achieve what I wanted but soon realised there exists none.
So as replied earlier, I will take this change as it for now. Let us
address this in future if it becomes an issue.

Thanks for quick test, we now know whom to bother if we need more testing
ðŸ˜‰ as out internal platforms are not that great to cover all the aspects
we add in the spec and even in the kernel.
