I think you're missing the point.  Although xts-aes-aesni has the
CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC bit set, the actual implementation processes the request
synchronously if SIMD instructions are currently usable.  That's always the case
in dm-crypt, as far as I can tell.  This algorithm has the ASYNC flag only
because it's not synchronous when called in hardIRQ context.

That's why your "xts-proxy" doesn't make a difference, and why it's misleading
to suggest that the crypto API is doing its own queueing when you're primarily
talking about xts-aes-aesni.  The crypto API definitely can do its own queueing,
mainly with hardware drivers.  But it doesn't in this common and relevant case.
