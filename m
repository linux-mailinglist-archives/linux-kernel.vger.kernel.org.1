Yes.

Not exactly. It was requested in probe, so it was enabled, and then it
was lazy disabled so it has basically always been enabled since it was
requested. If lazy disable isn't used then there's a problem.

Alright. The other case is request an irq without auto enable flag set,
which is pretty rare, and then mark it as wakeup capable and suspend. I
hope we can ignore this one.

Why? Can the gpio chip stop doing that?

Are you using the generic irqchip code? I don't see that used here so
talking about the usage of syscore and how that doesn't work for s2idle
doesn't seem relevant here.

>=20

I hope the irqs can be lazy disabled and whatever problem exists in gpio
driver can be resolved so that irqs can be left enabled in PDC and GIC
during suspend and idle entry. It's sort of odd to rely on lazy disable
behavior in this way, so it would need genirq maintainer approval.
