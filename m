Hmm, I see.

Well yeah, if the checks involve extra cache misses, that adds up. But AFAICS
you can't avoid that kind of checks with static key anyway (am I looking right
at is_kfence_address()?) because some kfence-allocated objects will exist even
after the sampling period ended, right?
So AFAICS kfence_alloc() is the only user of the static key and I wonder if it
really makes such difference there.

Sure, but I guess there are tools that make it no difference in effort between 1
machine and fleet.

I'll try to explain my general purpose distro-kernel POV. What I like e.g. about
debug_pagealloc and page_owner (and contributed to that state of these features)
is that a distro kernel can be shipped with them compiled in, but they are
static-key disabled thus have no overhead, until a user enables them on boot,
without a need to replace the kernel with a debug one first. Users can enable
them for their own debugging, or when asked by somebody from the distro
assisting with the debugging.

I think KFENCE has similar potential and could work the same way - compiled in
always, but a static key would eliminate everything, even the
is_kfence_address() checks, until it became enabled (but then it would probably
be a one-way street for the rest of the kernel's uptime). Some distro users
would decide to enable it always, some not, but could be advised to when needed.
So the existing static key could be repurposed for this, or if it's really worth
having the current one to control just the sampling period, then there would be two?

Thanks.
