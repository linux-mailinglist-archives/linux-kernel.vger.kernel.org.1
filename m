I amended the author on the lone commit in this pull request. For some
reason I was thinking using the "From:" line in the commit body was
how I should make things show up as Thomas as the author and me as the
committer, but looks like that=E2=80=99s not true.

I also removed my own Signed-off-by line from the pull request body
and included it in the commit instead of the Reviewed-by line.

Thanks,
Micah

  security: Add LSM hooks to set*gid syscalls (2020-06-14 10:52:02 -0700)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Add additional LSM hooks for SafeSetID

SafeSetID is capable of making allow/deny decisions for set*uid calls
on a system, and we want to add similar functionality for set*gid
calls. The work to do that is not yet complete, so probably won't make
it in for v5.8, but we are looking to get this simple patch in for
v5.8 since we have it ready. We are planning on the rest of the work
for extending the SafeSetID LSM being merged during the v5.9 merge
window.

This patch was sent to the security mailing list and there were no objectio=
ns.
