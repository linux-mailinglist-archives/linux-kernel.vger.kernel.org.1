BTW, Shaokun now tells me that the HiSi uncore PMU HW have such 
registers to identify the implementation. I didn't know.

So we could add that identifier file for those PMUs as proof-of-concept, 
exposing that register.

As for other PMUs which I'm interested in, again, future versions should 
have such registers to self-identify.

So using something derived from the DT compat string would hopefully be 
the uncommon case.

Cheers,
John
