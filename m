One last thing I'd like to understand. Is this behavior of throwing an
error going to applied to the non-DPCM case as well ? so at least thing
are consistent between both cases ?

IOW:
 * An error is now throw if dpcm_capture is set on the link and the CPU
 DAI support playback_only
 * on non-DPCM links, will an error be thrown as well if playback_only
 is not set and the CPU on the link happen to not support capture ?
