It happens a lot.

As I stated before, the 2 viable options are to a) move it into the
source files; ensuring code duplication, unnecessary maintenance
burden and probably disparity over time, or b) create (or locate if
there is one already) a special header file which is only to be
included by the users.

The later option gets really complicated if there are a variety of
tables which are included by any given number of source file
permutations.

The accepted answer in all of the other subsystems I've worked with so
far, is to use __maybe_unused.  It's simple, non-intrusive and doesn't
rely on any functional changes.

This time yes, but it's a hack that will only work with simple,
linear data.  Try doing that with some of the other, more complicated
tables, like mwifiex_sdio_sd8*.
