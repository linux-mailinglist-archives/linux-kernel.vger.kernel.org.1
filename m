Following by the USBPD 3.0 revision 1.2, section 8.3.3.24.1
The ErrorRecovery state is  used to electronically disconnect Port
Partner using the USB Type-C connector.
And there's one sentence to be said "The ErrorRecovery staste shall
map to USB Type-C Error Recovery state operations".
I also read ErrorRecovery state in USB TYPE-C 1.3 spec.
Section 4.5.2.2.2.1   ErrorRecovery state requirement listed the below text=
.
The port shall not drive VBUS or VCONN, and shall present a
high-impedance to ground (above
zOPEN) on its CC1 and CC2 pins.
Section 4.5.2.2.2.2 Exiting from the error recovery state
I read the description. The roughly meaning is to change the state to
Unattached(Src or Snk) after tErrorRecovery.

Summary the above text.
Reset HardResetCounter is ok in tcpm_detach.
My patch is just to relax the counter reset conditions during tcpm_detach()=
.
If not, it will check tcpm_port_is_disconnected().
And only two scenario, the hard reset count will be cleared to 0 at this ca=
se.
1) port not attached and cc1=3Dopen and cc2=3Dopen
2) port attached and either (polarity=3Dcc1, cc1=3Dopen) or (polarity=3Dcc2=
, cc2=3Dopen)

I think this judgement is narrow in tcpm_detach case.

I re-check all tcpm code for hard reset counter about the increment and res=
et.
They all meets USBPD spec. Only the detach case, I'm wondering why it
need to add the check for tcpm_port_is_disconnected().
