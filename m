This FMC2 is however an IP which can either operate external devices
(like ethernet chip on this parallel bus) or external flashes (like NOR
and NAND chips).

Can you provide a suggestion how this should be handled, if not as MFD?
It seems to me, that this is a Multi-Function Device .

If this discussion is a recurring topic, is there some documentation
which explains how such devices should be handled ?

Thank you
