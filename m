So I was thinking of having a function that allows a module to read member of
struct rq (or any struct for that matters), but I think that's the harder
(though neater) way around.

Just compiled a kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF_INFO; and doing

	$ pahole rq
	struct rq {
        raw_spinlock_t             lock;                 /*     0     4 */
        unsigned int               nr_running;           /*     4     4 */
        long unsigned int          last_blocked_load_update_tick; /*     8     8 */
        unsigned int               has_blocked_load;     /*    16     4 */

        /* XXX 12 bytes hole, try to pack */

        call_single_data_t         nohz_csd;             /*    32    32 */
        /* --- cacheline 1 boundary (64 bytes) --- */
        unsigned int               nohz_tick_stopped;    /*    64     4 */
        atomic_t                   nohz_flags;           /*    68     4 */
        unsigned int               ttwu_pending;         /*    72     4 */

        /* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */

        u64                        nr_switches;          /*    80     8 */
	.
	.
	.
	}

dumps the struct rq {...}; which means one can easily use that to autogenerate
a header containing the structs they care about accessing for their running
kernel.

pahole automatically knows how to find /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux to parse the
debug info btw.

The only caveat is that one has to recompile the module for each running
kernel; but that's acceptable I think. Not sure how many allow loading a module
that's not compiled for that particular kernel version anyway.

Note to try this you'll need pahole v1.16 or newer. And compiling pahole on
Ubuntu is a pain. I had to create a fedora docker image to compile it in.

So I think we have this already solved. Though not sure how to document it..

Thanks
