You have a good point. I can protect pending list related operations 
using spin lock and call it pending_lock which would be used in dl_xfer 
call back, channel release, read and poll. Use read lock for cur_buf in 
read().

I agree, will use this instead
if (mhi_result->transaction_status &&
		mhi_result->transaction_status != -EOVERFLOW)
