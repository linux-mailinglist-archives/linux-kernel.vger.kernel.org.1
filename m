Ok, that's a decision you are going to have to push upward on, as we
really can't take this without a working, open, userspace.

Especially given the copyright owner of this code, that would be just
crazy and foolish to not have open userspace code as well.  Firmware
would also be wonderful as well, go poke your lawyers about derivative
work issues and the like for fun conversations :)

So without that changed, I'm not going to take this, and push to object
that anyone else take this.

I'm not going to be able to review any of this code anymore until that
changes, sorry.

thanks,
