I agree that "sifive,<block><num>" is a SiFive thingy. Unfortunately,
lot of RISC-V implementations (SiFive and non-SiFive) have DTS
generated from RTL (not part of Linux sources) where most of them
use "riscv,clint0" as compatible string for CLINT.

Sure, a generic compatible string "riscv,clint0" OR "sifive,clint-1.0.0"
along with an implementation specific compatible string sounds
good to me.
