Are you going to experiment with this patch set and Graphene? Just
sanity checking so that I don't unnecessarily do duplicate work.

I ignored most of the discussion since I came here only with the
motivation of testing Graphene together with this patch set. I'm
assuming that motivation is always good no matter which angle you come
from. Thus, I might have missed the part I'm asking.
