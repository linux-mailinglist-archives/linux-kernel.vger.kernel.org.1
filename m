As discussed over IRC, I updated the patch as shown below.  Does that
work for you?

commit ec037e1f438074eb16fd68a63d699fc419c9ba0c

    rcu/segcblist: Prevent useless GP start if no CBs to accelerate
    
    The rcu_segcblist_accelerate() function returns true iff it is necessary
    to request another grace period.  A tracing session showed that this
    function unnecessarily requests grace periods.
    
    For exmaple, consider the following sequence of events:
    1. Callbacks are queued only on the NEXT segment of CPU A's callback list.
    2. CPU A runs RCU_SOFTIRQ, accelerating these callbacks from NEXT to WAIT.
    3. Thus rcu_segcblist_accelerate() returns true, requesting grace period N.
    4. RCU's grace-period kthread wakes up on CPU B and starts grace period N.
    4. CPU A notices the new grace period and invokes RCU_SOFTIRQ.
    5. CPU A's RCU_SOFTIRQ again invokes rcu_segcblist_accelerate(), but
       there are no new callbacks.  However, rcu_segcblist_accelerate()
       nevertheless (uselessly) requests a new grace period N+1.
    
    This extra grace period results in additional lock contention and also
    additional wakeups, all for no good reason.
    
    This commit therefore adds a check to rcu_segcblist_accelerate() that
    prevents the return of true when there are no new callbacks.
    
    This change reduces the number of grace periods (GPs) and wakeups in each
    of eleven five-second rcutorture runs as follows:
    
    +----+-------------------+-------------------+
    | #  | Number of GPs     | Number of Wakeups |
    +====+=========+=========+=========+=========+
    | 1  | With    | Without | With    | Without |
    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    | 2  |      75 |      89 |     113 |     119 |
    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    | 3  |      62 |      91 |     105 |     123 |
    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    | 4  |      60 |      79 |      98 |     110 |
    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    | 5  |      63 |      79 |      99 |     112 |
    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    | 6  |      57 |      89 |      96 |     123 |
    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    | 7  |      64 |      85 |      97 |     118 |
    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    | 8  |      58 |      83 |      98 |     113 |
    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    | 9  |      57 |      77 |      89 |     104 |
    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    | 10 |      66 |      82 |      98 |     119 |
    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    | 11 |      52 |      82 |      83 |     117 |
    +----+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    
    The reduction in the number of wakeups ranges from 5% to 40%.
