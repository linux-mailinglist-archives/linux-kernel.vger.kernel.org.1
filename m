Thanks, I will add it for next version. Let me also go poke some arch 
teams
to understand if we actually do gain something with this selection, who 
knows
we might get some additional details as well.

Yes but in this case we would better be explicit about the capable SoCs
because for someone in QCOM it would be easier to confirm if the SoC is
actually capable but it will not be very obvious for outside folks that
the particular SoC actually supports it. I will use a boolean field 
properly
initialized to indicate if a particular SoC is capable or not.

Mostly space, but I agree now that the boolean field is indeed better 
than
a separate table.

I vote for you :)
