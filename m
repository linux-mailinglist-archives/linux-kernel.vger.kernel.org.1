I think there is a misunderstanding.

Your example above refers to libc, which shows the addresses
correctly (on x86 and s390). I was refering to the kernel dso.
The issue only shows up on the kernel DSO (vmlinux and kallsyms)

When I use the -v option (or 'V' in TUI) I get this

  3.55%  find /lib/modules/.../build/vmlinux  0xf11ec  v [k] check_chain_key
                                              ^^^^^^^
This address is not correct as compared to readelf on vmlinux file:

[root@m35lp76 linux]# readelf -sW vmlinux| fgrep check_chain_key
 20698: 00000000001f0c70   486 FUNC    LOCAL  DEFAULT    1 check_chain_key
[root@m35lp76 linux]# 

The problem are the mapping functions with are applied for the kernel DSO.
In dso__process_kernel_symbol() the mapping is adjusted (around line 903)
and  function hist_entry_iter_add() saves the modified address in the
struct hist_entry->ip. This address is used from now on and printed.

Let me know and I will double check this and rework the commit message
as it was not good enough.

Thanks.
