As those are presumably in the same cgroup what does prevent them to get
stuck behind shared resources with taken during the reclaim performed by
somebody else? I mean, memory reclaim might drop memory used by the high
priority task. Or they might simply stumble over same locks.

I am also more interested in actual numbers here. The high limit reclaim
is normally swift and should be mostly unnoticeable. If the reclaim gets
more expensive then it can get really noticeable for sure. But for the
later the same can happen with the external pro-activee reclaimer as
well, right? So there is no real "guarantee". Do you have any numbers
from your workloads where you can demonstrate that the external reclaim
has saved you this amount of effective cpu time of the sensitive
workload? (Essentially measure how much time it has to consume in the
high limit reclaim)

To the feature itself, I am not yet convinced we want to have a feature
like that. It surely sounds easy to use and attractive for a better user
space control. It is also much well defined than drop_caches/force_empty
because it is not all or nothing. But it also sounds like something too
easy to use incorrectly (remember drop_caches). I am also a bit worried
about corner cases wich would be easier to hit - e.g. fill up the swap
limit and turn anonymous memory into unreclaimable and who knows what
else.
