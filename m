The idea is simply to have *one* single ID that caters for all
implementations, just like we did for PSCI at the time. This
requires ARM to edict a standard, which is what I was referring
to above.

There is zero benefit in having a platform-dependent ID. It just
pointlessly increases complexity, and means we cannot use the RNG
before the firmware tables are available (yes, we need it that
early).
