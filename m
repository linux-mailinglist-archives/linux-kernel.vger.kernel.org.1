Hi Petr,

Thanks for the review. Most of your suggested changes are fine and I'll
integrate them for the next version. Here a few comments on some open
issues.

Supporting such an API will require more than just a memory barrier
here. When a record is re-opened, it actually transitions back to a
reserved state. At that point there is no difference between a record
being extended and one that is reserved for the first time.

Perhaps my idea of chaining blocks [0] might be more appropriate. Then
there are discrete committed pieces that can be read if needed.

Either way, such a partial-read feature will require a new memory
barrier pair so a reader would see the state change before any data was
modified. As the code is now (without such a feature), a memory barrier
is not needed.

The initial cmpxchg() is assuming the previous descriptor is in the
commit+!final state (common case). But, for example, if it was in the
reserve+final state, the cmpxhg() would fail and the finalization is
already successful.

  + It is being reserved but is still uninitialized (state_var = 0).

  + It is being reserved but is not yet set (id is one wrap behind).

This works if we define that the FINAL flag can only be set when the
COMMIT flag is set. (More on this below.)

The FINAL flag has nothing to do with whether or not the data is
consistent. It's only use is to prevent a writer from transitioning a
descriptor back to reserved via cmpxchg(). What would a memory barrier
here be pairing with?

Correct. Setting the FINAL flag means the descriptor cannot be
_reopened_. It has nothing to do with the current state of the
descriptor. Once the FINAL flag is set, it remains set for the remaining
lifetime of that record.

Yes.

My first attempt was to implement this. It turned out complex because it
involves descriptors finalizing themselves _and_ descriptors finalizing
their predecessor. This required two new memory barrier pairs:

  - between a writer committing and re-checking the head_id that another
    writer may have modified

  - between a writer setting the state and another writer checking that
    state

After re-evaluating the purpose of the FINAL flag, I decided that it
would be simpler to implement the 2nd approach (below) and would not
require any new memory barrier pairs.

It does not cause more races. And I don't see where it will cause more
cmpxchg() calls. It probably _does_ lead to more cmpxchg() _code_. But
those are fallbacks for when the common case fails.

Well, the "many troubles" were due to my naive assumption about the
previous descriptor state. Once I realized that, the missing piece was
obvious.

I will reconsider the first approach. Perhaps adding memory barriers is
preferable if it reduces lines of code.

And we will need to clarify partial continuous line reading because
right now that will not work.
