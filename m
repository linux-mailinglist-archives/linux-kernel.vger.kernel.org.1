What is "Normal-NC"?

What is "rtl-sdr"

So is this a new problem?  Old problem?  Old problem only showing up on
future devices?  On current devices?  I need a hint here as to know if
this is a bugfix or just work to make future devices work properly.

Given that this code has not changed since 2016, how has no one noticed
this issue before?

And have you tested this change out on other systems (i.e. x86) to
ensure that this still works properly?

And why isn't this call used more by drivers if this is a real issue?
And will this cause issues with how the userspace mapping is handled as
now we rely on userspace to do things differently?  Or am I reading the
dma_mmap_attrs() documentation wrong?

thanks,
