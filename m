You mean the user of this binding (DTS)? It is not required because with
binding comes ABI stability. However it would be both appreciated and
useful because it would clearly note that this feature is used.

The feature brings additional complexity and +1 function call for each
simple register access. Therefore sometime in the future, one could see
it is not being used and start cleaning it up. Cleaning up usually
involves looking for users, then making binding deprecated and finally
removing the feature.

The collaboration between the Samsung LSI and upstream is quite
limited... And it basically does not exist between the Samsung mobile
division and upstream. This means that when we reorganize the
code, deprecate features/drivers or certain Exynos chips (e.g. 4212 and
4415 in the past) we look for users of them and if none are found - bye
bye feature.

The solution is either to participate (but this is difficult for
mentioned Samsung divisions because of internal policies) or just add
the user of such feature (e.g. DTS for evalkit).

The DT binding you posted looks good. It should go as first patch in this
series.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
