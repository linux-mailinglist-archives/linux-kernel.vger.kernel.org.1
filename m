I missed that going though :-(
I've looked for a fix to the access_ok(kernel_addr,0) being true issue.

Shouldn't TASK_SIZE be increased to cover all the 'tagged' addresses?
ISTR the 'tag' bits are the 'next' 8 (or so) address bits at the top
of valid user addresses.

Then presumably the user-copies would be able to use the tagged
address values getting whatever protection that gives.

ISTM that for kernel-user boundary checks TASK_SIZE is the
wrong constant.
(The upper limit for mmap() is entirely different.)
The limit should be independent of whether the process is 32 or 64bit
(any fault above 4G will fail to find a user-page for 32bit).
The limit can also go well into the address 'black hole' that
exists on x86-x64 (and similar) between valid user and kernel
addresses - handling the relevant trap should be too hard
(it is always an error, so need not be fast).

So with set_fs(KERNEL_DS) gone x86-x64 can (almost certainly)
do a cheap test for (long)addr >= 0 in access_ok() (+ length test).
While set_fs() is needed it can be:
	((long)addr & current->mask) >= 0
(masking off the top bit if kernel addresses are valid).
