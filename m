From: Dave Hansen <dave.hansen@linux.intel.com>

Some method is obviously needed to enable reclaim-based migration.

Just like traditional autonuma, there will be some workloads that
will benefit like workloads with more "static" configurations where
hot pages stay hot and cold pages stay cold.  If pages come and go
from the hot and cold sets, the benefits of this approach will be
more limited.

The benefits are truly workload-based and *not* hardware-based.
We do not believe that there is a viable threshold where certain
hardware configurations should have this mechanism enabled while
others do not.

To be conservative, earlier work defaulted to disable reclaim-
based migration and did not include a mechanism to enable it.
This propses extending the existing "zone_reclaim_mode" (now
now really node_reclaim_mode) as a method to enable it.

We are open to any alternative that allows end users to enable
this mechanism or disable it it workload harm is detected (just
like traditional autonuma).

The implementation here is pretty simple and entirely unoptimized.
On any memory hotplug events, assume that a node was added or
removed and recalculate all migration targets.  This ensures that
the node_demotion[] array is always ready to be used in case the
new reclaim mode is enabled.  This recalculation is far from
optimal, most glaringly that it does not even attempt to figure
out if nodes are actually coming or going.

 Allowing regular swap effectively restricts allocations to the local
 node unless explicitly overridden by memory policies or cpuset
 configurations.

+Page migration during reclaim is intended for systems with tiered memory
+configurations.  These systems have multiple types of memory with varied
+performance characteristics instead of plain NUMA systems where the same
+kind of memory is found at varied distances.  Allowing page migration
+during reclaim enables these systems to migrate pages from fast tiers to
+slow tiers when the fast tier is under pressure.  This migration is
+performed before swap.
