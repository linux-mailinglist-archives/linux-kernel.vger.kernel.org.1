Without all the cross-driver stuff dma_fence is just a
completion. Using dma_fence to get a completion is big abuse of what
it is intended for.

I think the only problem with this patch is that it keeps too much of
the dma_fence stuff around. From what I could tell it really just
wants to add a kref and completion to struct hl_cs_compl and delete
everything to do with dma_fence.

Not even sure the kref is needed ;)
