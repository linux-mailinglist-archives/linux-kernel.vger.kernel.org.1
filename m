As I said, this is a very specific call site, so passing specific info should
be fine, so not really important.

My general view on this (which is influenced by what Peter asked for when we
first introduced this) is that it's better to allow a trace point to
extract more signals from this specific call site by passing generic info and
let the event code/module do what it wants.

But the idea behind these tracepoints is that they can evolve when they need
to. So I don't think we should hung up on this if it makes things unnecessarily
complex.

Passing the count field is fine by me...

... but splitting the tracepoint doesn't look pretty.

If passing the rq and the count is enough for you, I'd vote this is better. If
not, then I won't insist into twisting things too much for the sake of it.
