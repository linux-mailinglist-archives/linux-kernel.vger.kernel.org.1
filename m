Bingo!

Actually this will be used *with* "simple-mfd".  "simple-mfd" will
ensure the sub-devices are probed and "syscon" will allow them to
share an address space.  This is currently possible for MMIO, but not
so for register maps located behind an I2C interface.

What sort of co-ordination do you require beyond what is offered?

Never a problem.
