Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: display: dw_mipi_dsi.txt: convert to yaml
Date:   Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:52:07 +0300
Message-Id: <20200416125207.425271-1-adrian.ratiu@collabora.com>

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This converts the Synopsis MIPI DSI binding documentation to yaml and
should be quite straightforward. I've added a missing ref clk and also
added Mark and Rob as maintainers based on 'get_maintainer.pl' results.

-Synopsys DesignWare MIPI DSI host controller
-============================================
-
-This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare MIPI
-DSI host controller. It doesn't constitue a device tree binding specification
-by itself but is meant to be referenced by platform-specific device tree
-bindings.
-
-When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
-this document are defined as follows. The platform device tree bindings are
-responsible for defining whether each optional property is used or not.
-
-- reg: Memory mapped base address and length of the DesignWare MIPI DSI
-  host controller registers. (mandatory)
-
-- clocks: References to all the clocks specified in the clock-names property
-  as specified in [1]. (mandatory)
-
-- clock-names:
-  - "pclk" is the peripheral clock for either AHB and APB. (mandatory)
-  - "px_clk" is the pixel clock for the DPI/RGB input. (optional)
-
-- resets: References to all the resets specified in the reset-names property
-  as specified in [2]. (optional)
-
-- reset-names: string reset name, must be "apb" if used. (optional)
-
