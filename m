I have started to believe the hardware is written badly at this point
:)

The thing is that the register can be used to send a 32 bit data
(which the driver already provides), or it can be used by writing
different bits to the SET register concurrently, without corrupting
the other bits as writing 0 to a bit has no effect, we have a separate
CLEAR register for that. And so it says that all the bits are ORed
together to generate the interrupt, i.e. any bit set will generate an
interrupt. Which also means that you can't send data 0 with the
register.
