Hmmm... not a bad idea. I think this could be useful in general. I'll
look into that separately.

Lol, thanks for the compliment :) My goal is to eventually enable it by default.

But there are a few corner cases on some boards where the DT has a
cycle and if we just blindly create device links for those, some of
the devices will end up not probing. I've slowly been identifying
different corner cases and making sure we drop the "bad link" that's
causing a cycle so that all the devices still probe properly.
Hopefully I can enable it by default soon.

Since this can't happen yet I went with option 2.

Just sent out v2 of this patch.
