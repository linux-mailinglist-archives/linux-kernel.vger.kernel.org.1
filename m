To build on Bard's correct answer, the irq thread only takes care of 
'immediate' actions, such as command completion, parity or bus clash 
errors. The rest of the work can be split in
a) changes to device state, usually for attachment and enumeration. This 
is rather slow and will entail regmap syncs.
b) device interrupts - typically only for jack detection which is also 
rather slow.

Since this irq thread function is actually part of the entire HDaudio 
controller interrupt handling, we have to defer the work for cases a) 
and b) and re-enable the HDaudio interrupts at the end of the irq thread 
function - see the code I shared earlier.

In addition, both a) and b) will result  in transactions over the bus, 
which will trigger interrupts to signal the command completions. In 
other words, because of the asynchronous nature of the transactions, we 
need a two-level implementation. If you look at the previous solution it 
was the same, the commands were issued in the irq thread and the command 
completion was handled in the handler, since we had to make the handler 
minimal with a global GIE interrupt disable we kept the same hierarchy 
to deal with commands but move it up one level.

You could argue that maybe a worker thread is not optimal and could be 
replaced by something better/faster. Since the jack detection is 
typically handled with a worker thread in all ASoC codec drivers, we 
didn't feel the need to optimize further. We did not see any performance 
impact with this change.

Does this answer to your concern?
