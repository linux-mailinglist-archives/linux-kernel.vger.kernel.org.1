I understand the Fixes tag mainly a help when backporting commits.

As Linux 5.8-rc7 is going to be released this Sunday, I wonder, if 
commit 3202fa62f ("slub: relocate freelist pointer to middle of object") 
should be reverted for now to fix the regression for the users according 
to Linux’ no regression policy. Once the AMDGPU/DRM driver issue is 
fixed, it can be reapplied. I know it’s not optimal, but as some testing 
is going to be involved for the fix, I’d argue it’s the best option for 
the users.


Kind regards,

Paul
