The point is that we are already in irq_thread which is designed to
handle any bottom half processing and can be given priority, spawning of
worker threads for another bottom half seems unnecessary to me and would
increase the latency for you.

I would have handled everything in irq_thread and returned, after all we
are in bottom half :)

Is there a reason for worker thread here, if so it is not clear to me
atm.

Thanks
