Thanks for reviews.

I am not sure what Stephen meant, but this diagram was available before.

Just for clarification this is not hardware diagram at all.
This is modeling of DP driver for msm.
Each box name above except "DRM framework", is file name in driver i.e. 
software module.
Each line and arrow shows how modules interact with each other.

For example, "DP PARSER" Box is pointing towards "DEVICE TREE" Box, that 
means
dp_parser.c file contains functions which are parsing device tree 
properties and so on...
