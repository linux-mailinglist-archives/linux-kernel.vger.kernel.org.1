I got your email on Friday but had to tend to other things.

The documentation isn't easy to follow and personally got very confused when I
started getting involved with the remoteproc/rpmsg subsystems.  I have the
intention of doing a good revamp but there is never enough time.

I will spin off a V2 of this set and we'll go from there.  I also want to get a
look at Kishon's patchset that Arnaud and Vincent were referring to before
making up my mind about how to move foward with your vhost RPMSG API patchset.

This is certainly taking longer than expected but I'd rather take the time to
explore all aspects of the question rather than having to live with a solution
that is not adequate.

Thanks for the patience,
Mathieu
