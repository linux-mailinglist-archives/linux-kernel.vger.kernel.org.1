It did pass, so I hereby join you in proclaiming Peter's patch to be
a fix for the NULL pointer problem.  ;-)

And a big "Thank You" to you guys for tracking this one down.  It was
not at all straightforward!

And the run on mainline without Peter's patch did in fact reproduce the
RCU CPU stall warning.  So this is a mainline bug that I will track down
separately.  This appears to be a failure to awaken RCU's grace-period
kthread, with the kthread remaining in 0x402 sleeping state for more
than 21 seconds, which is a bit excessive for a three-jiffy sleep. On
the other hand, many of the other CPUs seem to be stuck in stop-machine.
The stall persists.

This happened one time in 112 hours of TREE03 rcutorture, so bisection
will take some time, assuming that it works at all in this case.  ;-)

So Peter's patch is fully in the clear:
