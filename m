But during the time when PMD entry remains invalidated but still present,
it will be identical to pmd_protnone() if we choose to use PROT_NONE bit
here to have pmd_present() return positive. Because invalidated PMD entry
is not necessarily a pmd_protnone() entry.

You are right, set_pmd_at() does not need to clear that extra bit. As you
had suggested earlier, using bit 59 as PMD_PRESENT_INVALID here does work.
Will send out the next version soon.
