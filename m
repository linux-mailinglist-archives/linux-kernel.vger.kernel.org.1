The "port 0 not suspended" is actually for 3-1, if we print bus num and port + 1:
[  213.732977] xhci_hcd 0000:3f:00.0: port 3-1 not suspended

For port 4-1 it's always suspended before suspend the bus.
I'll send a patch to adjust the debug message for better clarity.

If my observation above is true, port 4-1 is indeed suspended by usb_port_suspend() rather than xhci_bus_suspend().

Seems like the issue doesn't happen if the host system use S2Idle instead of S3.
However, I can't see any difference in xHCI driver with different suspend methods.
Maybe the root cause is that, ASMedia controller and SMSC hub are just quirky?

This doesn't work because port 4-1 isn't suspended by xhci_bus_suspend().

Maybe we can restrict the case to ports that are suspended by USB_PORT_FEAT_LINK_STATE.
Is the following patch looks good to you?
