We've seen this before but dynamic debug provides all the information 
you need. see e.g. the logs from 
https://sof-ci.01.org/linuxpr/PR2425/build4447/devicetest/

jf-cml-rvp-sdw-1 kernel: [  289.751974] soundwire sdw-master-0: Slave 
attached, programming device number
jf-cml-rvp-sdw-1 kernel: [  289.752121] soundwire sdw-master-0: SDW 
Slave Addr: 10025d070000 <<< HERE
jf-cml-rvp-sdw-1 kernel: [  289.752122] soundwire sdw-master-0: SDW 
Slave class_id 0, part_id 700, mfg_id 25d, unique_id 0, version 1

That's a feature, not a bug? We use what address the platform firmware 
provides. If it's inaccurate then nothing can work.

Core yes but user not so much. If the intent is to list the devices 
present on the bus, your patch still requires manual work.

Now I get your point but
a) you already have a dynamic debug trace to list all devices
b) adding 'undeclared' devices would make things quite murky and is only 
half of the solution. We already struggle because we already have 
'ghost' devices in sysfs that are not physically present, and no way to 
differentiate between the two. If we did add those entries, then we'd 
need two new sysfs attributes such as
'declared' and 'enumerated'.
