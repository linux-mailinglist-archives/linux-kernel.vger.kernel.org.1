That is what I mean. I guess my words did not work. I should have used su=
bpages.

It might need extra code to get that number. Currently, the subpages from=
 split
THPs are appended to the end of the original page list, so we might need =
a separate
page list for these subpages to count PGMIGRATE_SPLIT. Also what if some =
of the
subpages fail to migrate? Do we increase PGMIGRATE_SPLIT or not?
