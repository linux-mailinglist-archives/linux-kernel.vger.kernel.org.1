Sorry about the late reply on this.

I really don't mind break statements in the final case and often do add
them, but I'm a bit reluctant to suggest that this is something that
need "fixing". There are a ton of these all over the kernel, and I think
we have too many opportunities for people to do mechanical clean ups
already.

Especially after Gustavo's work, the only real argument for adding them
is mostly moot as the compiler would catch it if anyone adds a new case
and forgets about the break statement.

I'd probably just leave it as is, if only to not inspire others to send
copy-cat "fixes".
