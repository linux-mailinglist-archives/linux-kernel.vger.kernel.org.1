It should not race now with a few barriers...V8 is not posted still (and it's a
bit different from the above broken snippet of mine :D)

Well yes in fact I was doubtful from the start if this rarely used code was
needed at all...I added just for consistency since some cleanup happens
elsewhere in SCMI...but...

... talking with Sudeep these days around the content of this thread, it seems that
we should be able anyway to modularize cleanly most of the SCMI core due to the
Android GKI thing....so I'm going to review the whole SCMI core and notification
shutdown/cleanup process soon....still I'm not convinced if I'll do anything different
here for notif at that point...as of now I fixed as above the current series foro v8
following your feedback then we'll see if I'll change it more drastically....

Thanks you for the feedback !
