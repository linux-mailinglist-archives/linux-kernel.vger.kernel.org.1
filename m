Oops; thanks for adding the list. I'll be sure to include it for any 
revised patches.

Hmm. It must have worked for me because the MAINTAINERS file appeared 
earlier in the patch than a newly added file in a patch I was checking 
that triggers this warning before this change, but doesn't after this 
change. This needn't be the case, though. Would it make sense to move 
the check for a diffstat-style /^\sMAINTAINERS\s*\|/ as well as a 
unidiff-style /^[-+]{3} [ab]\/MAINTAINERS$/ to the pre-scan sanitize phase?
