I've been told AOSS decides to wait
for modem suspend if its been notified
that modem is on through qmp_send. AFAIK
we never ran into this because AOSS sleep
sequence starts after xo-shutdown which
wont be reached in the presence of active
rpmh votes from modem.

Regardless we definitely want this genpd left
untouched during suspend/resume.
