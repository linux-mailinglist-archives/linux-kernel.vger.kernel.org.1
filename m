I understand the motivation behind pstore's hook for panic-writes.
It's a special thing and perhaps it's easier to support this via a
specific hook, rather than adopting the regular block device request
path to cope with some special I/O request. On the other hand, in the
discussion I have had with Bhaskara, I have pointed out several severe
implications for mmc to support these panic writes (and believe me,
there are even more than those I have brought up). So I am starting to
think that, perhaps there is a better option.

In any case, I didn't catch *why* pstore needs to force block device
drivers to implement specific pstore hooks to support the pstore file
system. I don't think this is the way it should work, for many
reasons. The pstore file system should be able to be extended, to
support the regular block device request path, no?

Kind regards
Uffe
