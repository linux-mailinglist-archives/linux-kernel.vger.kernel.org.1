It is just rcutorture, so I am not going to claim that I put a huge
amount of energy into researching better options.  ;-)

That would do it!  And yes, the idle-loop power-management code is in
an interesting situation in that RCU is not watching it by default, but
it does need to be debugged.  One straightforward approach would be for
the PM code to tell RCU to watch on entry and exit, but I don't have a
feel for how this would affect energy efficiency.
