Yeah, "desc_reserved" sounds better. I probably just wanted to free my
fantasy from the current code ;-)

Yup. Which is good especially on 32-bit architectures.

Good point. I am just not sure whether they should try read all ids
or they should refuse reading anything when a new bit is added.

Well, I really hope that we will not need new states anytime soon.
It would need a really strong reason.

I personally can't think about any use case. pr_cont() was special
because it was the writer side. All other steps of the printk rework
are on the reader side.

I believe that we are getting close with all the ring buffer code.
And I have good feeling about it.
