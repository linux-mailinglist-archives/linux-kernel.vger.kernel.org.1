The fact that all these bits are backed by one physical signal makes
the firmware implement its own mux-demux'ing scheme. So the choice was
between demux and single signal at a time. Had there been one signal
per bit, the implementation would have definitely been 'efficient'.

And the first platform the driver was developed on, required message
passing over the registers. So now my approach is to make do with what
we have...unless it shows in numbers.

Anyways, if it comes to that, I'd rather a separate "doorbell' driver
than a driver working in two s/w modes.

Thanks.
