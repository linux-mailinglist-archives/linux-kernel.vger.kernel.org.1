Look at kconfig-language.rst instead.

One thing that could be done (and is done in a few places for other reasons) is to add
a Kconfig comment if DEBUG_FS is not enabled:

comment "GUP_TEST needs to have DEBUG_FS enabled"
	depends on !GUP_TEST && !DEBUG_FS

e.g. drivers/hid/usbhid/Kconfig:

comment "Input core support is needed for USB HID input layer or HIDBP support"
	depends on USB_HID && INPUT=n
