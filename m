Since the user of this twist option will select console loglevel in a way
KERN_DEBUG messages are not printed to consoles, KERN_DEBUG messages will
be immediately processed (and space for future messages will be reclaimed).
Therefore, I don't think that more important messages will get overridden.

This twist option might increase possibility of mixing KERN_DEBUG messages
and non-KERN_DEBUG messages due to KERN_CONT case.

But if these concerns turn out to be a real problem, we can redirect
pr_devel()/pr_debug() to simple snprintf() which evaluates arguments
but discards the result without storing into the logbuffer.

Currently "static char textbuf[LOG_LINE_MAX];" is "static" because it is used
under logbuf_lock. If we remove "static", we can use "char textbuf[LOG_LINE_MAX];"
without logbuf_lock. Then, we can bring potentially dangerous-and-slow vscnprintf()
in vprintk_store() to earlier stage (and vprintk_store() will need to do simple
copy) so that oops in printk() will happen before entering printk-safe context.
I think that this change follows a direction which lockless logbuf will want.

Given that potentially dangerous-and-slow vscnprintf() is done outside of
printk-safe context, we can get more test coverage without difficult things.

syzbot can't test with custom patches. The only way to test this patch is
to send to e.g. linux-next.git which syzbot is testing.

The twist options are not specific to syzkaller. Anyone can selectively
enable the twist options.

It would help localizing the bug in this specific case.

It's not only about %p, even %d can crash kernel or leak sensitive
info (if it happens after-free/out-of-bounds/uninit). Overall it
increases code coverage and allows to catch more bugs earlier.

Since this NULL pointer dereference already happens before calling pr_debug(),
we won't store "fallback-read subflow=(efault)" to printk-safe buffer.

Just evaluating pr_devel()/pr_debug() arguments would help finding some bugs.
Again, we can change this twist option to redirect pr_devel()/pr_debug() to
simple snprintf() which evaluates arguments but discards the result without
storing into the logbuffer.
