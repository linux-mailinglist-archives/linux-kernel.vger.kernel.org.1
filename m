It looks this implementation is based on hardware crypto engine, could you
please add this info into f2fs.rst as well like inlinecrypt...

Why not using nid as DUN, then GC could migrate encrypted node block directly via
meta inode's address space like we do for encrypted data block, rather than
decrypting node block to node page and then encrypting node page with DUN of new
blkaddr it migrates to.

Thanks,
