Subject: [PATCH v3 0/3] New documentation text describing how to report issues (aka "reporting-bugs rewritten")

This series adds a new and mostly finished document describing how to report
issues with the Linux kernel to its developers. It is designed to be a lot more
straight forward and yet more detailed than the current text about this
(Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-bugs.rst). The new text still needs to be
reviewed by more people and a few open issues will need discussion. To make
these tasks easier, it was decided to add this document to the kernel sources in
parallel to the existing text for now:
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20201118172958.5b014a44@lwn.net

The first patch in the series adds the CC-BY-4.0 license to the
LICENSES/preferred/ directory, as the main author wants to make it easy for
others to use the new text as a base when writing about this topic in books or
on websites. He for now went with for dual-licensing the text under GPL-2.0+ and
CC-BY-4.0. We shouldn't lose much when people use the more liberal of the two,
but gain one thing: it increases chances that texts about this topic are based
on this one, which should make them more accurate and to our liking.

The last patch in the series adds a note to
Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-bugs.rst, declaring it obsolete and telling
readers to head over to the new text, as discussed after the v2 submission.

To see how the new text relates to the current reporting-bugs.rst document, see
v2 of this patchset, which gradually replaced the old text with the new (which
hasn't changed much since then):
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1605203187.git.linux@leemhuis.info/

To see how the new text from v3 relates to the one from v2 or v1, compare these
files with tools like meld or kdiff3:

https://gitlab.com/knurd42/linux/-/raw/reporting-bugs/Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-bugs-v3-wrapped.rst
https://gitlab.com/knurd42/linux/-/raw/reporting-bugs/Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-bugs-v2-wrapped.rst
https://gitlab.com/knurd42/linux/-/raw/reporting-bugs/Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-bugs-v1-wrapped.rst

The patch series is against docs-next and can also be found on gitlab:
git://git@gitlab.com:knurd42/linux.git reporting-bugs-v3

= Changes =

v2 -> v3
- drop the RFC tag
- add CC-BY-4.0 to LICENSES/preferred/
- instead of adding the new text in small parts while gradually replacing the
  old text simply dump the whole new text in a new file in one go
- add a note at the top pointing out the text is not completely finished yet,
  but ready for consumption
- add a few notes to the text pointing to issues that need discussion or work;
  this until now was done in the patch
- let the automarkup extension handle links to Documentation/whatever instead of
  using an explicit :ref:
- leave scripts/ver_linux untouched
- a handful of small improvements and fixes in the main text
- add a patch that makes reporting-bugs.rst obsolete

v1 -> v2
- all over: a whole lot of spelling fixes and small improvements. Many thx to
  suggestions from Randy Dunlap (many thx!).
- use "ref:" to reference MAINTAINERs file
- the licensing advice is now a rst comment near the top
- reshuffle and rewrite some parts to make them more straight forward:
 - The short guide (aka TL;DR)" (patch 2)
 - Locate kernel area that causes the issue (patch 9)
 - Install a fresh kernel for testing (patch 15)
