Hey Linus,

/* Summary */
This contains an annotation patch for a data race in copy_process() reported by
KCSAN when reading and writing nr_threads. The data race is intentional and
benign. This is obvious from the comment above the relevant code and based on
general consensus when discussing this issue. So simply using data_race() to
annotate this as an intentional race seems the best option.

A few comments on this since doing a grep data_race() reveals that currently
only kernel/rcu/* is making use of this new annotation and this seems to be the
first annotation in core kernel: when this was first sent to me I was obviously
aware of the existence of KCSAN but not whether we had established a consenus
around annotating places in the (core) kernel where we currently have benign
data races that KCSAN complains about. I don't know whether we have reached a
consensus in general yet or we're just doing this subsystem specific. We had a
bit of a back and forth on this topic related to this patch here. Most people
argued that because this is an intentional and benign data race that we should
simply annotate it. Now, we're obviously doing this for the sake of KCSAN and
given that KCSAN is now upstream and starting to report data races I guess
doing this is sensible. The linux-next tree contains various mm/* patches that
push in the same direction of annotating benign data races. So it seems going
forward we'll just funnel such patches upstream where they make sense.

/* Testing */
All patches have seen exposure in linux-next and are based on v5.8-rc1.

/* Conflicts */
At the time of creating this pr no merge conflicts were reported.
Fyi, I applied this patch right on top of the previous fixes before -rc2 was
out and hence didn't rebase my fixes tree on top of -rc3 because of that.
