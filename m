USB-2

However, it seems that they do. The urb never
gets an answer after snd_complete_urb refiles
it with usb_submit_urb.

Having arecord get stuck forever does not seem like
the right behavior, though :)

Interesting. That makes me really curious why things are
getting stuck, now...

That was my first intuition as well, given the documented
behavior of isochronous frames.

However, given that the device appears to stop sending
frames after that error, at least usbmon is not seeing
any, I am not sure what needs to happen in order to get
that behavior.
