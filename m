We talked about this before, but I would like some way to get failed
expectation/assertion information in the test in a consistent machine
parsible way. Currently we do the following:

    # Subtest: example
    1..1
    # example_simple_test: initializing
    # example_simple_test: EXPECTATION FAILED at lib/kunit/kunit-example-test.c:29
    Expected 1 + 1 == 3, but
        1 + 1 == 2
        3 == 3
    not ok 1 - example_simple_test
not ok 5 - example

Technically not TAP compliant, but no one seems to mind. I am okay with
keeping it the way it is, but if we don't want it in the KTAP spec, we
will need some kind of recourse.

Is this more of stating a fact or desire? We don't use TODO either, but
it looks like it could be useful.

Can you elabroate on this more? I am not sure what you mean.

I like it. I don't think we can rely on the TAP people updating their
stuff based on my interactions with them. So having a spec which is
actually maintained would be nice.

Maybe in Documentation/dev-tools/ ?

Yeah, I think it would be nice if all test frameworks/libraries for the
kernel output tests in the same language.
