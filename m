Thats right.

Another THP_PMD_MIGRATION_FAILURE event in migrate_pages() when the THP gets
split as a huge page could not be allocated. Both THP_PMD_MIGRATION_SUCCESS
and THP_PMD_MIGRATION_FAILURE will provide a better understanding regarding
THP migration events on the system.

Not at the moment. Like other VM events these new ones will provide required
statistics (and better understanding) on THP migration which can be used to
improve it further. Follows the same good old principle, if we cannot measure
we cannot improve.
