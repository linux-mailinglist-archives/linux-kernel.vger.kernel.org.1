So atm there's 0 working -modesetting with atomic because all of them
are caught up by the kernel's check to refuse to hand out atomic
support to X. I think we'd also need a patch to pump the atomic setcap
to 2 (which should bypass the kernel's hack), plus of course someone
needs to release 1.21.

I think the only risk I'm seeing if nouveau currently also allocates
formats (sometimes, maybe) that you then can't always scan out. If
that's not the case, then silently allowing old modifiers to keep
things working sounds like the best option.

Otherwise sounds all reasonable, maybe more comments and hints to what
exactly is broken in userspace for the real patch (once tested and
all).
