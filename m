Preemptible hypercalls are never done with interrupts off. To be more
precise: they are only ever done during ioctl() processing.

I can add an ASSERT() to xen_preemptible_hcall_begin() if you want.

Correct. More precise: the hypercalls in question can last very long
(up to several seconds) and so they need to be interruptible. As said
before: the interface how this is done is horrible. :-(

 From my point of view this sounds fine.

I'd prefer to not break preemptible hypercall in between.

IMO the patch should be modified along your suggestion. I'd be happy to
test it.
