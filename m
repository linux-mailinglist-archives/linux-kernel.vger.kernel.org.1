Thanks for the patch but I think it is not ideal. The thing is that
s_mount_opt is actually a NUL terminated string (we are just careful and
don't rely on that to avoid problems when the fs is corrupted). So it is
possibly shorter than those 64 bytes reserved for it in the superblock and
using kmemdup_nul() will allocate and copy more memory than strictly
necessary.
