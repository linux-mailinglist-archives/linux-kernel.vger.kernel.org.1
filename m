We absolutely must execute callbacks out of order in order to avoid
OOM due to RCU callback floods.  This is because if we don't execute
callbacks out of order, there will be a time when we are not executing
callbacks at all.  If execution gets preempted at this point, it is
quite possibly game over due to OOM.
