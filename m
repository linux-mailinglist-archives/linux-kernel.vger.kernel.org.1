Not sure if I understand your concerns completely here.

Anyways I wanted to clarify that the jep106 encoding is applicable only
for manufacturer's id and not for SoC ID or revision. Not sure if that
changes anything about your concerns.

I agree with your idea of combining attributes, not sure exactly which
ones yet.

Valid concern and I will pass this to interface authors.

Agreed, but not sure what author(s) have to say. I have cc-ed one of them.

Yes, definitely. Good to get feedback.

But this just indicates manufacturer id and nothing related to SoC family.
If it is jep106:043b, all it indicates is Arm Ltd and assigning it to
family doesn't sound right to me.

I had requests for both of the above during the design of interface but
I was told vendors were happy with the interface. I will let the authors
speak about that.

Sure.

Not sure again.

OK, I agree on ease part. But for me, we don't have any property in the
list to indicate the vendor/manufacturer's name. I don't see issue adding
one, name can be fixed as jep106_identification_code is too specific.

How about manufacturer with the value in the format "jep106:1234" if
it is not normal string but jep106 encoding.
