TL;DR ????selinux and apparmor ignore no_new_privs????

What?????

As I understand a bound transition it is a transition to a state with
a set of permissions that are a subset of what was previously held.
Which is consistent with the mandate of no_new_privs.

Yes.  Looking at that commit I do see that selinux appears to be
deliberately ignoring no_new_privs in specific cases.

WTF.

I can't see how it would be possible to be robust without completely
changing the locking.  Locking that right now in a simpler model we have
not figured out how to make obviously correct.

Except where selinux deliberately ignores no_new_privs this is
consitent.

Which is the BUG I am reporting.  It should be progressingly tighter.

Why do you need to escape no_new_privs.  Why does anyone need to escape
no_new_privs?

Enforcing no_new_privs as documented would break userspace?

Isn't the opposite true that you are breaking people by not enforcing
it?
