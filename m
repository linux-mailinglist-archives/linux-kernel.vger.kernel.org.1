Thanks for the idea!

I like this cleanup.  I'm so wonder how I forgot using '->vm_prev'. :)

This seems meaningless to me.  This will iterate the vma tree in address order,
as same to the old code.  Moreover, 'rb_next()' and 'rb_entry()' might be
slower than the direct reference of '->vm_next'.

This means we are skipping this node only.  It would make no big difference
from the old code, as we still iterate all nodes.

Rather than that, by the definition of the '->rb_subtree_gap', we could skip
all vmas in the subtree.  For example:

	vma = rb_entry(rb_last(vma->vm_rb), struct vm_area_struct, vm_rb);
	continue;

Nevertheless, this function is not the performance critical point, as this will
be called only once for the initial time in this patch, and the followup
patches will make this function to be called for every regions update interval,
which defaults to 1 second.  The followup patches will also allow users set the
interval large enough and even configure their own optimized version.  For the
reason, I concern simpleness ratherthan performance here.

That said, your fundamental idea obviously makes sense and the changes for that
would be subtle.  I will update this patch in abovely modified way and do some
test.

If I missed something, please let me know.


Thanks,
SeongJae Park
