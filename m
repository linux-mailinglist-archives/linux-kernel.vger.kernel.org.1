On the kernel side, vblank work should complete during the vblank
period, making it a harder real time requirement.  So the thinking is
this should be a higher priority.

But you are right, if you aren't overcommitted it probably doesn't matter.

tbh, I'm not fully aware of the background.  It looks like most of the
SF threads run at priority=2 (100-2==98), and the main one runs at
priority=1

There is some cgroup stuff that is pinning SF and some other stuff to
the small cores, fwiw.. I think the reasoning is that they shouldn't
be doing anything heavy enough to need the big cores.

I mean, commit_work should be higher priority than the other (display
related) RT tasks.  But the kernel doesn't know what those priorities
are.

yeah, SF==SurfaceFlinger, and yeah, 1 and 2..

I think this would work.. drm/msm doesn't use vblank work, so I
wouldn't really have problems with commit_work preempting vblank_work.
But I think the best option (and to handle the case if android changes
the RT priorties around in the future) is to let userspace set the
priorities.

I don't *think* so, but I'm not 100% sure if they are showing up in
traces.  So far it seems like SF stomping on commit_work.  (There is
the added complication that there are some chrome gpu-process tasks in
between SF and the display, including CrGpuMain (which really doesn't
want to be SCHED_FIFO when executing gl commands on behalf of
something unrelated to the compositor.. the deadline approach, IIUC,
might be the better option eventually for this?)
