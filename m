I know when it's polling that an IPI can be skipped as set_nr_if_polling
will succeed.

Yes, it might. If between the check for polling and set_nr_and_not_polling,
the polling may have stopped and the CPU entered a c-state and an IPI
is sent but in that case, either path is likely to result in some sort
of IPI.

The terminology is unhelpful. In this case when I said "idle and polling",
I was thinking of the idle task running poll_idle() and the CPU should
not be in any c-state below C0 but it doesn't really matter due to your
own comments.

Crap, I rushed this and severely confused myself about what is going
on. It is definitely the case that flipping this check does not give
any benefit. The patch shows a benefit but I'm failing to understand
exactly why. How I ended up here was perf indicating a lot of time spent
on smp_cond_load_acquire() which made me look closely at ttwu_remote()
and looking at function graphs to compare the different types of wakeups
and their timings.

With this patch when netperf is waking the server, netperf is all that
is active with the wakeup completing 3.489 microseconds. If this check
is flipped, the idle thread is running at the same time and clearly
interleaving with netperf in the ftrace function_graph and the wakeup
takes 9.449 microseconds. The exact timings vary obviously but it's
what led to the patch -- brute force starting at function_graphs until
something fell out.

Yeah, I need to think more about why exactly this patch makes a difference.

I can fix that.

And that too.
