I was OK with Joonsoo's original patch which is why I Ack'ed it.  However,
my sense of simplicity and style may not be the norm as I have spent too
much time with the hugetlbfs code. :)  That is why I did not chime in and
let Michal and Joonsoo discuss.  I can see both sides of the issue.  For
now, I am OK to go with Joonsoo's patch as long as the issue below is
considered in the the next patchset.
