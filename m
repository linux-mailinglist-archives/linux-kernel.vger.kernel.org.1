I think the story it's trying to tell is this (but, like most of us,
I do find Mr Lockdep embarrassingly difficult to understand; and I'm
not much good at drawing race diagrams either):

CPU0 was in user_shm_unlock(), it's got shmlock_user_lock, then an
interrupt comes in. It's an endio kind of interrupt, which goes off
to test_clear_page_writeback(), which wants the xa_lock on i_pages.

Meanwhile, CPU1 was doing some SysV SHM locking, it's got as far as
shmem_lock(), it has acquired info->lock, and goes off to user_shm_lock()
which wants shmlock_user_lock.

But sadly, CPU2 is splitting a shmem THP, calling shmem_uncharge()
that wants info->lock while outer level holds xa_lock on i_pages:
with interrupts properly disabled, but that doesn't help.

Now, that story doesn't quite hold up as a deadlock, because shmem
doesn't use writeback tags; and (unless you set shmem_enabled "force")
I don't think there's a way to get shmem THPs in SysV SHM (and are
they hole-punchable? maybe through MADV_REMOVE); so it looks like
we're talking about different inodes.

But lockdep is right to report it, and more thought might arrive at
a more convincing scenario.  Anyway, easily fixed and best fixed.

(But now I think my patch must wait until tomorrow.)

Hugh
