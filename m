Agreed, we must first define the terms.  Let's call this a pseudo-deadlock.

I always talk about the tracer, so it is a deadlock in the tracer yes.
And it is also a deadlock in the process trying to execve the process
that execve's is doing something silly.  That is not shutting down
the threads that are maybe doing dangerous things, while one of them
does execve.  In my programs I do never do that because it is always
a race condition and dangerous not shut down threads before exiting
or execve.  But the tracer wants to debug this silly program, just to
understand why it is occasionally malfunctioning.  Then a deadlock in
both processes happens at the same time, repeatably.  Now a user called
Bernd is scratching his head why that happens.....

Sorry, I was writing another more important mail :), and interrupted
that quickly, to help you with one aspect of the problem that may
have been overlooked, so it is quite possible that I missed something.

So the intention was just to make sure you make your decisions based
on the some facts that I realized because I have debugged the tracer,
and found out that the kernel is expecting the tracer to have knowledge
of future events, and that is impossible for the tracer, so the tracer
must fail when he predicts the future wrong.  Again that is just my
impression I had when debugging the tracer.

The trace looks like this
do {
   wait()
   if(needed) ptrace_access();
   if(needed) ptreace_otherstuff();
} while(1);

when the thread death event is in the tracer's input queue,
the tracer does not know of it unless it looks,
but from time to time the tracer wants to do other things
like attach a process that may be doing random things.
But if I think about it, the parent changes in the moment.
The original parent did not listen and make the zombie
thread go away, but now the trace is the parent, but
it is unable to call wait since it is just doing
ptrace_access.  It is possible that I have missed something,
then it woud be good that others with more experience help
with me putting the puzzle together.

I just say, changing the order of the events is not what the tracer
wants.  The tracer wants to get out of the ptrace_access and do
listen to the events, in the correct order.  If the events happen
in a different order than before the tracer may be confused.
That is the point I am trying to make.  And yes I may be wrong.
So please correct me, if that is the case.

Yes, and no.  To solve this problem we have non-blocking sockets
and pipes.  When I write a server I never use any blocking APIs
because I know a write can block at any time, when the server and
the client use a blocking strategy.  So also when I write a client
it is always using non-blocking sockets.  But not all clients are
written this way, therefore the server must be forgiving.

It is not a good idea to ignore people who are barely aware of the right
terms.  It is better to try to understand what they really mean and
translate what they said to what they meant, then ask if you understood
correctly what was meant.  At least that is how I would like the discussion
like that to be.  It is a suggestion and not meant as an offense.

Once again, I am new to this lkml list, and it is not meant as an offense.

Yes SIGKILL does resolve this.
Either the tracer, or one of the tracess, but which one?

But SIGKILL is impolite, I prefer SIGTERM. And that does not resolve
the pseudo-deadlock.

What my other patch (you know the one you hated ;-) ) does, is making
ptrace non-blocking when it must, by returning -EAGAIN.
But keep the order of events as they are.
I think your solution will change the order of events in order
to make the kernel more simple.  Right?

The test case does that on purpose to demonstrate something that
may also happen in strace, but in a very unlikely case, but the
likelihood is not zero and when it happens users are surprised.

The test case makes only sense together with the last part of
the patch.  If you prefer another solution then you must change
the test case as well.  That is allowed.
Changing strace is not allowed.  And breaking something in the
strace-5.5 test suite is also not allowed.

No do not make my test case happy.  That is not what it was written

Isn't that is an API change?

I think, there is no way how we can avoid an API change, but we have the
choice which API change we want.

Also that is a possible allowed solution.
Just leave the test case as is, or change to KFAIL so known FAIL.

The remaining problem is certainly not important enough to make you
unhappy.
