AFAIK it is not, or what we are protecting against with this anyway
then?

Let say an LSM makes decision for the permissions based on origin. If we
do not have this you can:

1. EMODPE
2. mprotect

I.e. whatever LSM decides, won't matter.

The other case, noexec, is now unconditionally denied.

They are both origin, the point being that you know what you're dealing
with when you build the enclave, not when you map it.

This is my current rewrite of the commit message in my master branch:

"
    mm: Add 'mprotect' callback to vm_ops
    
    Intel Sofware Guard eXtensions (SGX) allows creation of blobs called
    enclaves, for which page permissions are defined when the enclave is first
    loaded. Once an enclave is loaded and initialized, it can be mapped to the
    process address space.
    
    There is no standard file format for enclaves. They are dynamically built
    and the ways how enclaves are deployed differ greatly. For an app you might
    want to have a simple static binary, but on the other hand for a container
    you might want to dynamically create the whole thing at run-time. Also, the
    existing ecosystem for SGX is already large, which would make the task very
    hard.
    
    Finally, even if there was a standard format, one would still want a
    dynamic way to add pages to the enclave. One big reason for this is that
    enclaves have load time defined pages that represent entry points to the
    enclave. Each entry point can service one hardware thread at a time and
    you might want to run-time parametrize this depending on your environment.
    
    The consequence is that enclaves are best created with an ioctl API and the
    access control can be based only to the origin of the source file for the
    enclave data, i.e. on VMA file pointer and page permissions. For example,
    this could be done with LSM hooks that are triggered in the appropriate
    ioctl's and they could make the access control decision based on this
    information.
    
    Unfortunately, there is ENCLS[EMODPE] that a running enclave can use to
    upgrade its permissions. If we do not limit mmap() and mprotect(), enclave
    could upgrade its permissions by using EMODPE followed by an appropriate
    mprotect() call. This would be completely hidden from the kernel.
    
    Add 'mprotect' hook to vm_ops, so that a callback can be implemeted for SGX
    that will ensure that {mmap, mprotect}() permissions do not surpass any of
    the original page permissions. This feature allows to maintain and refine
    sane access control for enclaves.
"

I'm mostly happy with this but am open for change suggestions.
