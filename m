Userspace would either need to have two mappings (I don't believe there 
are any architectural issues with that - but this could be awkward to 
arrange in some situations) or be careful to avoid faults. Basically 
your choices with one mapping are:

  1. Disable tag checking (using prctl) when touching the memory. This 
works but means you lose tag checking for the VMM's own accesses during 
this code sequence.

  2. Read the tag values and ensure you use the correct tag. This 
suffers from race conditions if the VM is still running.

  3. Use one of the exceptions in the architecture that generates a Tag 
Unchecked access. Sadly the only remotely useful thing I can see in the 
v8 ARM is "A base register plus immediate offset addressing form, with 
the SP as the base register." - but making sure SP is in range of where 
you want to access would be a pain.

The kernel could provide a mechanism to do this, but I'm not sure that 
would be better than 1.

This, however, is another argument for my current approach of 
"upgrading" the pages automatically and not forcing the VMM to set 
PROT_MTE. But in this case we probably would need a kernel interface to 
fetch the tags as the VM sees them.
