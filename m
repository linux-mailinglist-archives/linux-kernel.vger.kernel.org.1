I would argue that the trouble originates from every uart driver using
its own naming scheme and thereby creating separate namespaces. If all
uarts would register as /dev/ttySnn then the serialN alias method would
work. These non-overlapping namespaces is something the linux kernel
driver community has allowed to happen.

If the namespaces are not abandoned and disallowed, then the serialN
alias method must no longer be used for any driver that does not create
/dev/ttySnn devices. Every namespace will require its own alias base.
Or forget about deriving the number from an alias and set the number in
a property in the device tree node itself. The latter has my preference.
