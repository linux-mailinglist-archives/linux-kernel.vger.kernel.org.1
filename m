Those groups above seem to be driver specific groups. Looking at the
code, some drivers seem to be setting them. Also, this attribute can
only be decided after a driver has successfully bound to the device
because dev_has_sync_state() has to check the bus and the driver for
sync_state() support.

If this is an attribute specific property, it might work. I'll take a look.

I had a nagging feeling I was missing something. Duh! I'll make sure I
do proper clean up in v2.

Thanks for the review.
