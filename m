Ok, this seems clear ! I'll give it a try. By looking quickly at the code I
think that n_sectors will also have to be updated after discovering the
sector_size from BFPT (for flash size computation). Since some parameters
of the nor are initialized early in spi_nor_info_init_params using
sector_size, should I move the call making use of sector_size later in the
init (in spi_nor_late_init_params for instance) ?

I will try to do it but I will probably only be able to test the patches in=
 a=20
couple of weeks due to our architecture not being rebased on 5.7 yet.
