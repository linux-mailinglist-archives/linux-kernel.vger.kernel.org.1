Just one question.

In our patch, we pass the shared memory address as the second argument 
of the SiP service, as it means we don't have to hardcode that in our 
firmware. Sudeep, do you know if it was intentional in 
smc_send_message() to leave that out? If we leave it out, we are 
requiring the secure monitor to hardcode the shared memory address.


Regards,
Paul
