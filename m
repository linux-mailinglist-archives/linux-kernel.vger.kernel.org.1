Dynamic launch is the term used to reference the event/process of
restarting a system without reboot to establish the DRTM. It is defined
in the TCG Glossary[1], is discussed in detail in the TCG D-RTM
Architecture specification[2], and covered in minimal detail in sections
9.5.5 and 34.2 of the TCG TPM2.0 Architecture specification[3].

The work for this is split across different teams with different
resourcing levels resulting in one organization working Intel and
another working AMD. This then raised the concern over submitting a
single patch set developed by two groups pseudo-independently. In this
situation the result would be patches being submitted from one
organization that had no direct development or testing and therefore
could not sign off on a subset of the patches being submitted.

We would not disagree with those sentiments but see the previous
response about the conflict that exists.

It is analogous as we used it as the pattern to follow for adding a
configurable entry point to the kernel. There was a discussion on this
when we published the RFC patches[4].

The details are a bit more than I would prefer to explain here, I would
recommend reading section 2.3 and 2.4 of Intel's TXT Software
Development Guide[5] for all the details of the state and the prescribed
initialization sequence.

TrenchBoot is a meta-project that is working to bring a unified approach
to using DRTM across CPU implementations and open source projects.
Currently we are working to integrate a dynamic launch preamble (the
code that sets up for calling the dynamic launch CPU instruction) in
GRUB, building an open AMD Secure Loader that aligns with how Intel's
SINIT ACM hands off to an MLE, bring the first directly launchable
implementation to Linux (Secure Launch) with Xen being the next directly
launchable implementation, providing the u-root project a secure launch
initramfs init routine to demonstrate a policy driven measurement and
attestation framework that can be used in conjunction with a Secure
Launch kernel.

As mentioned above, it is just shorthand for Secure Launch.

The validation and setup steps are to ensure the environment was setup
in a manner that we expected as outlined in the Intel TXT Software
Development guide[4]. At this point these are,
- Ensure that SENTER completed successfully and was not initiated by TBOOT.
- Check that the private MMIO register bank is available.
- Fetch values needed from the TXT heap for later operations.
- Verify the PMR values cover the MLE and other memory regions that need
to be secure.
- Reserve certain TXT specific areas of physical memory.
- Fetch the copy of the DMAR table from the TXT heap to provide to the
IOMMU driver later.

The securityfs nodes provides access to the TXT registers to inspect the
details from the dynamic launch and access to the DRTM event log. The
DRTM event log is setup by the DRTM process and is a different/separate
event log from the SRTM/UEFI event log. We need write access for use
cases where the Secure Launch kernel is being used as an intermediate
launch kernel where additional measurements about the final target
environment are being collected.

The SEXIT instruction "exits" SMX mode. The why is because when in SMX
mode the CPU has a set of behaviors different than what is typically
expected, especially for SMP management. As good custodians, this
ensures that the system is in a usable state for a follow-on kernel that
is not SMX/Secure Launch aware. From a security use case perspective,
leaving SMX mode disables access to localities 1-3 of the TPM. This
essentially "locks" the values in the DRTM PCRs from further
modification/extends until another dynamic launch event is fired which
will in turn result in the DRTM PCRs being reset.
