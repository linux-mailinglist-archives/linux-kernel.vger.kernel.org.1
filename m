In all honesty, this is probably a mix. Some vendors definitely have
their out of tree crap that they'll load anyways, and some others use
other mainline governors for semi-reasonable reasons (e.g, for lower
tier devices, they often don't want to go though the costly and tedious
process of tuning uclamp, so they'll go for a more 'aggressive' governor
like ondemand). Note that this is the minority, though. The majority in
Android use schedutil, and I'm quite happy with that.

However, the point I tried to make here is orthogonal to that. As of
today using another governor than schedutil is fully supported upstream,
and in fact it isn't even enabled by default for most archs. If vendors
feel like using something else makes their product better, then I don't
see why I need to argue with them about that. And frankly I don't see
that support being removed from upstream any time soon.

Don't get me wrong, I do think schedutil is the way to go. And we do
recommend it in Android. I'm simply saying that /mandating/ it in GKI
would only add more friction than really necessary. Making it modular,
OTOH, might ease things a bit.

I guess it all boils down to the code. If modularizing schedutil really
is too ugly, then I'll drop the series and we'll just build it in and
waste memory on devices that don't use it. It's not the end of the
world, but it's a shame if we don't have strong technical reasons to do
that -- all other governors _are_ modular.

IMO the changes in this series aren't *too* bad -- moving
schedutil_cpu_util to fair.c is probably a sensible change in its own
right for instance. The biggest 'issue' is probably the exports, but
these will need discussions on a case by case basis. And I'm happy to
try and rework the code to work around when possible (as is the case for
runqueues for instance).

I hope that helps!

Thanks,
Quentin
