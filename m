Not every warning needs to be addressed, there's a reason some of these
are hidden behind W=1 or higher.

Yes.

I'm afraid that's not sufficient to shut the compiler up.

I'll send you patch expanding these accessors instead. Having exported
functions implemented by macros is particularly nice (hard to grep for
etc). There are a couple of more sets of control-bank registers that
could potentially have shared the implementation and which motivated the
use of macros, but it does not seem very likely that we'll be adding
those anytime soon anyway.
