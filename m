OK I would be very happy to look at it so I can learn a bit about the
hands-on and general approach here. Just send it to this address
directly and I will look!

My interest is mainly to see this progress so any way I can help or
tinker I'm happy to do. You can just incorporate my contributions if
any, I don't care much about code authorship and such things, it
just makes things more complex.

I'm going for vacation the next 2 weeks or so, but then it'd be great if
we can start looking at this in-depth!

Thanks!
