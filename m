Better don't use a term that already has well defined meaning in a
given context when you refer to something else.

True, RTS and TX are outputs in UART mode, however in sleep mode the pins
are (currently) configured as GPIOs and inputs (again, see "arm64: dts:
sc7180: Add wakeup support over UART RX" of this series), hence the
drive-strength attribute does nothing. If needed/preferred you can configure
the pins as outputs and specify the desired state instead of using pulls,
in that case specifying the drive strength can be useful.

This is generally correct while the system is running, but (with the current
pinconf) not when the system is suspended IIUC. When the system is in suspend
the function of the UART pins is changed to GPIO, hence the UART ceases to
control RTS.

Otherwise how do you explain that wakeup stops working when you configure
a pull-up instead of a pull-down? According to your comment the UART should
be driving the RTS depending on its readyness.

I'm referring to the case where the system is suspended and the UART doesn't
control RTS (see above).
