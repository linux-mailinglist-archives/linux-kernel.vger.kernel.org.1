I was first a bit confused by the above table. The order looks fine
but I was not sure about the indentation. I think that some more
details are needed to get the picture and context.

I see the following order in start_kernel():

1. Add spcr consoles: by acpi_parse_spcr() called from setup_arch().
2. Add and register early consoles: by parse_early_param()
3. Add normal consoles from command line: by parse_args()

4. Register tty console: by vty_init() called via long chain
   from fs_initcall(chr_dev_init). It seems to be init call
   in 5th round, see include/linux/init.h

5. Register other (serial) consoles are most likely registered from
   device_initcall() in 6th round, see include/linux/init.h.

The consoles defined by the device tree are not added directly.
Instead, the probe() callbacks checks whether such console is
selected in device tree by of_console_check() called from
uart_add_one_port().

I am afraid that this is a problem with many defaults. They might be
good enough for many people but others would want something else.

It might be acceptable to add consoles. But it might be a problem to
remove consoles or change the currently preferred one.

The only exception would be when most people are annoyed with the
current default. But this need to be discussed with people familiar
with the given architecture or device.

The generic parameters: console=tty, console=serial, console=dt, console=spcr
looks fine to me. IMHO, the only problem might be when a particular
serial console drive is not able to guess reasonable defaults for the
baud rate, etc.
