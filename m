Hi,

I got Dell XPS 13 9310 laptop which has QCA6390 wlan/bt device. I
noticed that on v5.11-rc1 suspend fails every time like this:

[   91.134305] Bluetooth: hci0: SSR or FW download time out
[   91.134314] PM: dpm_run_callback(): acpi_subsys_suspend+0x0/0x50 returns -110
[   91.134331] PM: Device serial0-0 failed to suspend: error -110
[   91.134338] PM: Some devices failed to suspend, or early wake event detected

On v5.10 suspend worked just fine and after a bisect I found reverting
commit 2be43abac5a8 ("Bluetooth: hci_qca: Wait for timeout during
suspend") fixes the issue for me. More info below.

Is there a quick fix for this or should the commit be reverted for
v5.11? I think it's important to have btqca suspend working on the final
release as there quite a lot of laptops with QCA6390.

I'll also include ath11k list as we have XPS 13 9310 users there and so
that they are aware of this regression.

    Bluetooth: hci_qca: Wait for timeout during suspend
    
    Currently qca_suspend() is relied on IBS mechanism. During
    FW download and memory dump collections, IBS will be disabled.
    In those cases, driver will allow suspend and still uses the
    serdev port, which results to errors. Now added a wait timeout
    if suspend is triggered during FW download and memory collections.
