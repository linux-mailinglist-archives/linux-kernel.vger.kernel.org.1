I have not been able to think of a clean way of introducing calls to 
preempt_disable() in exit_mmap(), which is the more problematic case.  
We would need to track state across multiple invocations of 
zap_pte_range() (which is called for each entry in a PMD when a 
process's memory is being unmapped), and would also need to extend this 
to tlb_finish_mmu(), which is called after all the process's memory has 
been unmapped: 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.10/source/mm/mmap.c#L3164.  As a 
follow-up to this patch, I'm submitting a patch that re-introduces the 
GFP mask for cma_alloc, that will perform indefinite retires if 
__GFP_NOFAIL is passed to the function.
