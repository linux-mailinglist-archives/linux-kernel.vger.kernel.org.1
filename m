In addition to what Michal said...

The mask is not passed to this function, so I would just redefine it, as is done
in the hugetlb case. We probably don't even need the __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL for the
THP case asi it's just there to prevent OOM kill (per commit 0f55685627d6d ) and
the costly order of THP is enough for that.
