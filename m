I think I have pretty clearly described why we want to reset the hard
limit to 0, so, unless there is an alternative I don't see why we
should not be doing this.

I am trying to see if "no eligible task" is really an issue and should
be warned for the "other use cases". The only real use-case I can
think of are resource managers adjusting the limit dynamically. I
don't see "no eligible task" a concerning reason for such use-case. If
you have some other use-case please do tell.
