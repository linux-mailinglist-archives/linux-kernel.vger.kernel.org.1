Hmm, I understand, thank you.

This was the first thing I did! (and I tested and it works too)
        https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=Patch&x=13acf917900000

However, I was worried that doing so might mean freeing an skb
that might be required somewhere by the serdev connection (which could
possibly lead to a null ptr dereference), so I thought closing the connection
altogether might be a better alternative.

But now, since I've been told better, I'll submit a v3, that makes the more
sensible change and doesn't close the serdev_device, with a much more
informative commit message!

I also found a similar implementation in mrvl_close() where the serdev_device
was being closed and felt it might be the right way to go. But I now know that
I shouldn't have overlooked the fact that the open functions for both differ.
I'm sorry for this.

Like you mentioned, I should've given more priority to the mirror function,
and looked to see if even they were along the same lines, and I will be sure to
keep that in mind.

Thank you so much for this review, and for your time! :)
