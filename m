Sorry. Phone e-mail client is dumb.

The VMM wants to make sure that the guest can't touch the poison
(this is important because not every touch of poison results in a
recoverable machine check. If the guest's next touch is an unaligned
access that crosses from the poison cache line to a non-poisoned line
then h/w will signal a fatal machinecheck and the whole machine will
go down).

The VMM gets the page fault (because the unmapping of the guest
physical address is at the VMM EPT level).  The VMM can't map a new
page into that guest physical address because it has no way to
replace the contents of the old page.  The VMM could pass the #PF
to the guest, but that would just confuse the guest (its page tables
all say that the page is still valid). In this particular case the
page is part of the 1:1 kernel map. So the kernel will OOPS (I think).

PLease explain how a guest (that doesn't even know that it is a guest)
is going to figure out that the EPT tables (that it has no way to access)
have marked this page invalid in guest physical address space.

Guest is going to be screwed in this case.
