That is a good question. I'm really not sure if user can do anything
with it. But also users do not care about these kind of logs. So
probably even do not know about them.

What is nice in this solution that if you want to try "debug" such
problem you just need to ask user for logs. Nothing is needed to enabled
/ disable.

You are probably right.

In past I did one thing thanks to these logs. I searched for these log
messages on interned. More results were on forum discussions. I tried to
contact users of those posts and I think 3-4 people wrote me back with
details which allowed me to extend dell-wmi driver to handle additional
key codes.

So I see two benefits from these logs: 1) no special setup is needed to
gather these logs (useful for non-power users) and 2) ability to search
on internet if we have laptops which generates such unknown key codes
and users are "complaining" or posting their logs for investigation on
places where are no kernel developers available.

So question is if these two points are reason why to stick with these
logs or turn them off by default.

I still think it can be useful.

Of course, I agree.
