Subject: [PATCH v1 0/9]  Support qcom USB3+DP combo phy (or type-c phy)
Date:   Tue, 25 Aug 2020 19:47:02 -0700

This patch series is based on v11 of the msm DP driver submission[1]
plus a compliance patch[2]. In the v5 patch series review I suggested
that the DP PHY and PLL be split out of the drm driver and moved to the
qmp phy driver. This patch series does that, but it is still marked as
an RFC because there are a couple more things to do, mostly updating the
DT binding and getting agreement on how to structure the code.

Eventually I believe the qmp phy driver will need to listen for type-c
notifiers or somehow know the type-c pinout being used so this driver
can program things slightly differently. Right now, I don't have any way
to test it though, so I've left it as future work. For some more
details, the DP phy and the USB3 phy share the same physical pins on the
SoC and those pins pretty much line up with a type-c pinout modulo some
CC pins for cable orientation detection logic that lives on the PMIC. So
the DP phy can use all four lanes or it can use two lanes and the USB3
phy can use two lanes. In the hardware designs that I have access to it
is always two lanes for USB3 and two lanes for DP going through what
looks like a type-c pinout so this just hard codes that configuration in
the driver.

Here's the example node that I'm using on sc7180:

	usb_1_qmpphy: phy-wrapper@88e9000 {
		compatible = "qcom,sc7180-qmp-usb3-dp-phy";
		reg = <0 0x088e9000 0 0x18c>, // usb pll (or serdes)
		      <0 0x088e8000 0 0x38>, // dp com
		      <0 0x088ea000 0 0x40>;  // dp pll (or serdes)
		status = "disabled";
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		ranges;

		clocks = <&gcc GCC_USB3_PRIM_PHY_AUX_CLK>,
			 <&gcc GCC_USB_PHY_CFG_AHB2PHY_CLK>,
			 <&gcc GCC_USB3_PRIM_CLKREF_CLK>,
			 <&gcc GCC_USB3_PRIM_PHY_COM_AUX_CLK>;
		clock-names = "aux", "cfg_ahb", "ref", "com_aux";

		resets = <&gcc GCC_USB3_PHY_PRIM_BCR>,
			 <&gcc GCC_USB3_DP_PHY_PRIM_BCR>;
		reset-names = "phy", "common";

		usb_1_ssphy: usb3-phy@88e9200 {
			reg = <0 0x088e9200 0 0x128>, // tx0
			      <0 0x088e9400 0 0x200>, // rx0
			      <0 0x088e9c00 0 0x218>, // pcs
			      <0 0x088e9600 0 0x128>, // tx1
			      <0 0x088e9800 0 0x200>, // rx1
			      <0 0x088e9a00 0 0x18>;  // pcs misc
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			clocks = <&gcc GCC_USB3_PRIM_PHY_PIPE_CLK>;
			clock-names = "pipe0";
			clock-output-names = "usb3_phy_pipe_clk_src";
		};

		dp_phy: dp-phy@88ea200 {
			reg = <0 0x088ea200 0 0x200>, // tx0
			      <0 0x088ea400 0 0x200>, // rx0
			      <0 0x088eaa00 0 0x200>, // dp phy
			      <0 0x088ea600 0 0x200>, // tx1
			      <0 0x088ea800 0 0x200>; // rx1
			#clock-cells = <1>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};
	};

I had to put the serdes register region in the wrapper node and jam the
common area (dp_com) in the middle. Sort of a mess but it was the best I
could do to make the driver changes minimially invasive. I also had to
change the node names to 'usb3-phy' and 'dp-phy' from 'phy' so that I
could differentiate the different phys in the driver. Otherwise the qmp
driver was already mostly prepared for two different phys to sit next to
each other inside the phy wrapper so it was mostly just a chore of
moving code from one place to another.

I'll also point out that I found out the DP controller driver is
resetting the aux phy settings right after it configures it. The last
patch in this series rips out the DP PHY and PLL code from the drm
driver and wires in the phy API calls instead. In that same patch I also
fixed this aux reset behavior by removing the bit that resets the aux
phy. I believe that the aux configuration is broken in the DP driver
but I fixed it now I think.

Changes from RFC (https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200611091919.108018-1-swboyd@chromium.org)
 * New patch for DT binding
 * Rebased onto latest DP patch series

TODO:
 * Clean up phy power on sequence a bit so that it is done in one place
   instead of two
 * Allow link rate to change after phy is powered on?
 * Make the runtime PM logic detect combo phy and power down both?
