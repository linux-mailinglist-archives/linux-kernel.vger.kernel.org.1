Yeah this is exactly why Vineeth was suggesting separate FS without
nested hierarchies. The CGroupv2 unified hierarchy may be too
restrictive to pick and chose which nested or non-nested
sub-hierarchies want to share a core if the root of any (sub)hierarchy
is tagged. As mentioned in CGroup v2 documentation, someone thought it
is a good idea to kill the CGroup v1's non-unified flexibility so here
we are. Don't get me wrong, it has advantages but then the lack of
flexibility results in issues as these.  BTW,  there are other
usecases where CGroup v2 has shown to be inflexible at my employer.

The other option is a new system call to share a core between pid A
and pid B and the user can create arbitrary relationships as they
choose.

The color can be used along with 'tag' to provide a second-level of
isolation. So like, a container can decide to further create isolation
within itself, but the system daemon that creates the container need
not worry since the container is already isolated from other
containers, owing to the first-level of isolation via the tag file.

That could be done.

That's upto the arch right, I haven't dug too much into how this
works, but I know sysfs shows if a CPU has some vulnerabilities or not
such as if microcode is present to do flushing, or not.

Exactly. Consider my reply on the first para repeated here.

For cpuset, the cpuset rules and other mechanisms like
sched_setaffinity will obey it. I am not sure if that will make sense
for tagging though. Are you saying the prctl should fail to tag
something if cgroup has already tagged?

Yeah, this part of my email was just about how forking of a task in a
cgroup behaves wrt tagging. Since it gets a bit weird , I was
suggesting the use of earlier mentioned flags.

Thanks.
