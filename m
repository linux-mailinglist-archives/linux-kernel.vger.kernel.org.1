So far this hasn't been necessary, since the new output until the first
two-minute pause fit on one screen and I could photograph it.

I saved the call trace lines to a file and did this (with `$(pwd)/' the
script did not run):

Did I do something wrong or do I need to pass certain compiler flags
when building the kernel (when I build Emacs I pass CFLAGS=3D'-Og -g3')?

But the cdrom seems to have nothing to do with power-off failing, since
it happens even when the cdrom is detached (and hence there were no sr
warnings in the log output), or am I misunderstanding you?

By the other patch do you mean the following?  (This email was also put
into my spam by GMX and AFAICT has not yet shown up on the vger list.)
