This is untested, but what I mean is:

static int ptrace32(int req, pid_t pid, int addr, int data) {
   int ret;
   /* new enough kernels won't clobber r8, etc. */
   asm volatile ("int $0x80" : "=3Da" (ret) : "a" (26 /* ptrace */), "b"
(req), "c" (pid), "d" (addr), "S" (data) : "flags", "r8", "r9", "r10",
"r11");
   return ret;
}

with a handful of caveats:

 - This won't compile with -fPIC, I think.  Instead you'll need to
write a little bit of asm to set up and restore ebx yourself.  gcc is
silly like this.

 - Note that addr is an int.  You'll need to mmap(..., MAP_32BIT, ...)
to get a buffer that can be pointed to with an int.

The advantage is that this should work on all kernels that support
32-bit mode at all.

Strictly speaking, on Linux, there is no unified concept of a task's
bitness, so "set all these registers according to the target's
bitness" is not well defined.  We could easily give you a
PTRACE_SETREGS_X86_32, etc, though.
