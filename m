I think v2 patch wraps it up...

There is no protocol rule that NFS server MUST return ESTALE
for file handle of a deleted file, but there is a rule that it MAY return
ESTALE for deleted file. For example, on server restart and traditional
block filesystem, there is not much choice.

So returning ESTALE when file is deleted but opened on another ceph
client is definitely allowed by the protocol standard, the question is
whether changing the behavior will break any existing workloads...

Maybe they can, but that would be like NFS server restart, so
all bets are off w.r.t open but deleted files.
