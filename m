I had always figured that timeout case somehow represented more of a 
definite failure than others, but if not then great! :)

However, I do now wonder if we really need these two separate cases with 
subtly different messages - after all, giving up at init vs. giving up 
30 seconds later still represents some kind of timeout out either way. 
Given that there are at least 5 underlying situations with varying 
levels of certainty and severity:

- No driver loaded for dependency (yet, if CONFIG_MODULES)
- Driver present and dependency will be probed at some point in future
- Driver present but dependency will not be probed (e.g. disabled in DT)
- Dependency itself is deferred but will be re-probed at some point
- Dependency probed, explicitly failed and will not be retried

then I'm not sure there's much value in having two slightly different 
ways of saying "any of those may have happened".

Robin.
