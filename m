Your point is valid but the size calculation (XEN_FLEX_RING_SIZE) should
work correctly even with order 0:

    (1UL << ((0) + XEN_PAGE_SHIFT - 1)) = 1 << (12 - 1) = 2048

So I am thinking that the protocol should still work correctly, although
the performance might be undesirable.

FYI The smallest backend I know of has order 6.

Yes, you are right, thanks for noticing this! I meant to do that here
too but somehow forgot. This should be:

   p9_xen_trans.maxsize = XEN_FLEX_RING_SIZE(max_ring_order) / 2;
