Yes removing platform devices is the goal for Intel now :) Pierre & Bard
have been diligently trying to solve this.

Only difference is the means to end goal. I am not convinced that this
should be in soundwire subsystem.

Looks like folks are trying to review and port to use this bus. Makes
sense to me..

Well if the plan for 'virtual-bus' goes well, it should be  a simple
replacement of platform->virtual for Intel driver. Rest of the driver
should not be impacted :)
