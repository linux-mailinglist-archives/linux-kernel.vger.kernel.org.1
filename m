That's a good sign that we don't hit this path in your tests.

I guess also, with your latest patch on releasing the lock to be in a
non-atomic context, and then doing the allocation, it became even more
permissive? If you drop that patch and tried, do you still not hit the
synchronous path more often?

Could you also try introducing memory pressure by reducing your system's
total memory and see how it behaves?

Yes, true. That is one drawback is it higher memory usage. But if you have at
least 1 kfree_rcu() request an each CPU, then pre-allocation does not
increase memory usage any more than it already has right now. Unless, we
extend my proposal to cache more than 2 pages per-cpu which I think you
mentioned below.

You really have to hit OOM in your tests to trigger it I suppose. Basically
the emergency pool improves situation under OOM, but otherwise does not
improve it due to the direct-reclaim that happens as you mentioned. Right?

Well, one proposal is only 5 lines extra ;-). That has got to be at least a
bit appealing ;-) ;-).

You are saying this with regard to my proposal right?  I agree number of
pages could be increased. The caching mechanism already in-place could be
starting point for that extension.
