Yes, we prior to the ZONE_DMA change, you still couldn't reserve 1G/512M in the first 4GB.
The memory reported by the bios may be splitted by some "reserved" entries.
Like this:
...
2f126000-2fbfffff : reserved
2fc00000-396affff : System RAM
  30de8000-30de9fff : reserved
  30dec000-30decfff : reserved
  30df2000-30df2fff : reserved
  30e20000-30e4ffff : reserved
  39620000-3968ffff : reserved
396b0000-3974ffff : reserved
39750000-397affff : System RAM
397b0000-398fffff : reserved
39900000-3990ffff : System RAM
  39900000-3990ffff : reserved

The main purpose of this series is to solve the large allocation requirements.
Before the DMA_ZONE, both the original crashkernel=X and large allocation with my  patches
work well.

With the DMA_ZONE, both the original crashkernel=X and large allocation with my  patches
may fail to boot. Both need to think about the DMA_ZONE.

It is a good idea to combine the two.

For parameter crashkernel=X, we do like this:
1. allocate some low memory in ZONE_DMA(or ZONE_DMA32 if CONFIG_ZONE_DMA=n)
2. allocate X size memory in a high region

",low" argument can be used to specify the low memory.

Do i understand correctly?

Yes. We can let crashkernel=X  try to reserve low memory and fall back to use high memory
if failing to find a low range.

About the function reserve_crashkernel_low(), if we put it in arch/arm64, there is some common
code with x86_64. Some suggestions about this?
