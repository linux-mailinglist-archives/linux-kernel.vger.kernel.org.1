I think either jep106:5678 or jep106:1234:5678 (or some variation with
different field separators if you prefer) would be fine here.

I probably wouldn't mix those in with the same driver. If machine and
serial_number have no smccc interface, then they should be left out,
but there could be a separate soc_device that gets that information
by other means, usually using one of the existing hardware id register
drivers.

Well, I suppose we could have the entire data from the smccc interface
in a central place somewhere, such as (to stay with my example)
"1234:5678:9abcdef0" in an attribute of any soc_device driver that
adds a call to a library function for the jep106 ID, or possibly in
/sys/firmware or even a field added to /proc/cpuinfo.
