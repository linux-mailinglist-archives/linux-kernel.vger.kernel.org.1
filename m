Quite honestly I'm probably not the right person to be reviewing this
code.  I mostly just noticed one of your early patches and it looked
strange to me.  Hopefully someone with actual experience in how all
the DRM components work together can actually review and see if this
makes sense.  Maybe Sean would know better?

That being said, let me at least look at what you're saying...

Sure, it's part of the sequence.  It's also documented in pm.h as:

 * The principal role of this callback is to prevent new children of
 * the device from being registered after it has returned (the driver's
 * subsystem and generally the rest of the kernel is supposed to prevent
 * new calls to the probe method from being made too once @prepare() has
 * succeeded).

It does not feel like that matches your usage of this call.

So the general model in Linux is that children suspend before their
parents, right?  So you're saying that, in this case, the parent needs
to act on the child before the child suspends.  Is that correct?

Rather than hijacking the prepare/complete, I'd be at least slightly
inclined to move the other driver to turn off its clocks in
suspend_late and to turn them back on in resume_early?  That seems to
be what was done in "analogix_dp-rockchip.c" to solve a similar
problem.

OK, if there is another driver in DRM then I guess I won't object too
strongly.  Note that when searching for other drivers I noticed this
bit in todo.rst:

* Most drivers (except i915 and nouveau) that use
* drm_atomic_helper_suspend/resume() can probably be converted to use
* drm_mode_config_helper_suspend/resume(). Also there's still open-coded version
* of the atomic suspend/resume code in older atomic modeset drivers.

Does anything get fixed if you do that?  It seems like it'd cleanup
your code a bit so maybe worth doing anyway...

---

I guess the last question I'd want resolved is why you have this asymmetry:

SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS(pm_runtime_force_suspend, msm_pm_resume)

Why couldn't you use pm_runtime_force_resume()?
