The swap encoding goes to bit 57, so going higher shouldn't be an issue.

No. Only that we have some precedent like PTE_PROT_NONE (bit 58) and
wondering whether we could use a high bit as well here. If we can get
them to overlap, it simplifies this patch further.

No strong opinion either way. Yours is clearer.

You could use a VM_WARN_ON.

We can indeed have a PROT_NONE pmd but does it matter? All you need is
that pmdp_invalidate() returns the original (present pmd) and writes a
value that is still pmd_present() while invalid. You never modify the
new value again AFAICT (only the old one to rebuild the pmd).

It is indeed a problem if set_pmd_at() clears the new
PMD_INVALID_PRESENT bit but my understanding is that it doesn't need to
(see below).

My point is that pmdp_invalidate() is never called on an already invalid
pmd. A valid pmd should never have the PMD_INVALID_PRESENT bit set.
Therefore, set_pmd_at() does not need to clear any such bit as it wasn't
in the old value returned by pmdp_invalidate().

I'm not convinced we need to unless we nest pmdp_invalidate() calls
(have you seen any evidence of this?).
