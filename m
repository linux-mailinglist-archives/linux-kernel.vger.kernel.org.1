Right, no dependency is set so the rpmsg_ns driver is never probed...
And  name service announcement messages are dropped if the service is not present.

if rpmsg_virtio_bus is built-in
-> using "select RPMSG_NS" in RPMSG_VIRTIO kconfig should ensure that rpmsg_ns is also built-in 
if rpmsg_virtio_bus is build as module rpmsg_ns.ko should be loaded first.
-> MODULE_SOFTDEP could be used in virtio_rpmsg_bus.c

Thanks,
Arnaud
