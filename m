We don't in fact send a wakeup IPI when polling. So this might end up
with an extra IPI.

Not strictly true; MWAIT can be very deep idle, it's just that with
POLLING we indicate we do not have to send an IPI to wake up. Just
setting the TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag is sufficient to wake up -- the
monitor part of monitor-wait.

I'm completely confused... the result here is that if you're polling you
do _NOT_ queue on the wake_list, but instead immediately enqueue.

(which kinda makes sense, since if the remote CPU is idle, it doesn't
have these lines in its cache anyway)

But the subject and comments all seem to suggest the opposite !?

Also, this will fail compilation when !defined(TIF_POLLING_NRFLAGG).

The labels wants to go inside the ifdef, otherwise GCC will complain
about unused labels etc..
