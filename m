Well, long story short, we need to create a relationship between RPi4's PCI=
 bus
(which hangs from an interconnect in DT) and RPi4's co-processor, which has=
 a
highly unconventional firmware driver (raspberrypi.c in drivers/firmware). =
The
PCI bus just needs the co-processor interface to be up before probing, that=
's
all (I'll spare you the details of why). Ideally we want to avoid adding
platform specific code into an otherwise generic bus driver as it'll be use=
d by
a number of unrelated SoCs, and it's generally frowned upon.

There is no generic property to handle this case, and it's very unlikely th=
ere
will ever be one, since these firmware drivers have very little in common. =
I
guess this could make an argument for a generic _last resort only_
'supplied-by' property, but I bet this solution won't be very popular.

Another idea that comes to mind for vendor specific properties would be
exporting a macro in the lines of "DEFINE_SIMPLE_PROP()" for supplier drive=
rs
to define custom properties. The parse_prop() callbacks could then be added
into a special section for of/property.c to pickup and parse. The good thin=
g is
that the list length would be limited by the kernel configuration and the
maintenance burden moved to the driver authors, at least to some extent.

Anyway, if something comes to mind to solve RPi4's situation feel free to
propose anything :).

Regards,
Nicolas
