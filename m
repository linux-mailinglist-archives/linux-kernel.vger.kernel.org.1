To complement Steven=E2=80=99s response, we are fully aware in VMware =
about this
issue since the patches were sent, and the hypervisor developers =
consider
how to address it. Indeed, vmmon does something similar to VirtualBox =
and
Jailhouse. The planned restriction on the creation of executable =
mappings by
modules would require changes in all of these hypervisors.

Actually, IIUC, even Mircosoft Hyper-V might be broken by the proposed
changes that prevent the creation of executable mappings. It may appear =
as
if there is no issue since the __vmalloc() that hyperv_init() uses in =
the
kernel to setup the hypercall pages will be changed into vmalloc_exec() =
[1].
But, AFAICT Microsoft can also setup the hypercall page in a module as =
part
of its Linux Integration Services. This code uses
__vmalloc(=E2=80=A6PAGE_KERNEL_RX), and would therefore be broken. [2]

It seems to me that the proposed restrictions on which instructions a =
module
is allowed to run are completely new, have significant implications, and
therefore would hopefully not be rushed in. Alternatively, a transition
period in which the checks only trigger warnings would be beneficial.

I am not a developer of the VMware hypervisor, but my understanding is =
that
developers have every intention to fully comply with the new =
restrictions on
memory mappings and instructions that a module is allowed to run. They =
can
consider sharing VM-entry/exit code with KVM even if requires code =
changes
for VMware. They just ask for sufficient time to make the required
adaptations. It would help to have a reasonable timeline for when each
of the proposed changes (__vmalloc(), MOV-CR/DR, other instructions)
is expected to be merged.
