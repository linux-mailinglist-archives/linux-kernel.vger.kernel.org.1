Ok. I'll split it into three series. 

Before posting the next version, it would be nice to have some feedback
specially at the DT documentation patch:

	https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/176043f329dfa9889f014feec04e7e1553077873.1597160086.git.mchehab+huawei@kernel.org/T/#u

as any changes there will need to be reflected on the other patches
from this series.

Btw, despite being 3 drivers, I added only two DT docs, as the
regulator description is done together with the PMIC one.

Thanks,
Mauro
