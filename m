I assume that this task-specific feature could coexists in
select_idle_core() and select_idle_cpu() with the already existing
runtime heuristics (test_idle_cores() and the two sched features
mentioned under E/F) to reduce the idle CPU search space on a busy system.

IMHO the opposite use case for this feature (favour high throughput over
short wakeup latency (Facebook) is already cured by the changes
introduced by commit 10e2f1acd010 ("sched/core: Rewrite and improve
select_idle_siblings()"), i.e. with the current implementation of sis().

It seems that they don't need an additional per-task feature on top of
the default system-wide runtime heuristics.
