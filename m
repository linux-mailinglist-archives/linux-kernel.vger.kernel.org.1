What I'd really like to see as a policy in the kernel going forward in
that ANY new commit that adds some hack or workaround for a specific
compiler version add a comment about which toolchain version was
problematic, that way when we drop support for that version years
later, we can drop whatever hacks and technical debt we've accumulated
to support that older version.  I'd prefer a comment that can be
`grep`ed rather than a commit message that may need to be searched.
That way when bump the compiler version we can grep for comparisons
against that version and start cleaning up code.

The case that comes to mind:
commit 87e0d4f0f37f ("kbuild: disable clang's default use of
-fmerge-all-constants")
cites https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18538
The fix for which shipped shortly after reported in clang-6.
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/9
Looking at the dates between kernel patch and toolchain patch, I guess
that the kernel patch authors didn't know what release that workaround
would be fixed in, but basically they need it for CLANG_VERSION <=
600001.
We can remove that entirely if we commit to a minimally supported
version of clang.

Also, I'm a little salty still about our conversation with
asm_volatile_goto:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20180907222109.163802-1-ndesaulniers@google.com/
I think lore is missing your response, that triggered a v2:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20181031182909.169342-1-ndesaulniers@google.com/
(Strange, I literally cannot find evidence that you ever responded to
that...am I going crazy? Looks like my work email has been being
auto-deleted because...lawyers) (lkml.org is missing it:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/7/1628, and I didn't have our mailing
list set up then).
You also know how I feel about empty asm statements (`asm("");`). ;)

Anyways, the point is "please tag these workarounds with a toolchain
version somehow such that someday we may pay off our debts."

Thanks for the endorsement. :P

What's the latest on that `clac` in exception handlers discussion?

TL;DR: probably not.

For Pixel 2, we shipped a Clang built kernel using clang-4.  Since
then I've moved it to be using near ToT Clang (clang-11).  That device
was aarch64 with no hard dependency on `asm goto` (only x86 added
that, and only in 4.20, so not really an issue for stable kernel
branches older than that).  `asm goto` support shipped in clang-9.

Yeah, I think so, too.

Are you planning on attending plumbers? I'm planning a session on
talking about this more, which I think would be helpful.  What I
really want is the CI people in the room, because I don't want to
claim version X+ is supported if we don't have the CI coverage of it.
Also, there's a few footnotes as to our compatibility table at the
moment; completely missing backends, broken backends, targets we only
got working recently, etc. etc. etc..  I also think we need to be
delicate in the wording for what tools are required for building a
kernel vs optional or substitutes.

Will older versions of clang work? It's highly likely and we don't
have a list of what if anything is actually broken with them.  But if
we can get CI coverage for the latest release or two, I'm happy to
commit to supporting just those.
