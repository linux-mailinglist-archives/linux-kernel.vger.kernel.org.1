Seems correct.  Maybe apply the same thing to handle_exception_nmi() and
handle_dr()?  It's probably not a problem because VMX does not have set_dr6(),
however it's still cleaner to avoid clearing DR_TRAP_BITS and set DR6_RTM
manually before calling kvm_queue_exception() every time in VMX code.

Yep, I guess the in-guest debug test will still need the exception support,
though I also guess we don't need that when we have the kvm unit test, and
anyway I'll start with the simple (KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG).
