Yeah, I see the point. 

Please notice that the above will only appear if someone calls "make htmldocs"
and no sphinx-build is found at the patch (or if the version is below the
lower bond - 1.4.x).

Sure. I can work on a patch for such purpose.

If we move the lower bound, it will start to refuse running "make htmldocs"
with versions below 1.7.

I'm ok on rising the lower limit. Yet, not sure if this is worth.
I mean, last time I checked, html builds fine with older versions.

Ok, if we rise the bar, we may be able to do some cleanups at the
extensions, removing some backward-compatible code. So, I would wait
for some future Sphinx version where the extensions would stop working,
requiring someone to touch them.

Thanks,
Mauro
