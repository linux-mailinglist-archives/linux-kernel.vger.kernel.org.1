I believe what Scott is looking for is a form of official statement that
indicates that 5.10 is indeed a 6 years Long Term Stable kernel, as
opposed to an informal piece of information like this:

https://twitter.com/kernellogger/status/1320731458311491587

(personally that is how I got to hear about 5.10 being selected, taking
this with a grain of salt).

It is not new indeed but there is a recurring pattern, and I have been
told by some of our customers who use the kernel.org's releases.html
page that this is how they know which kernel is going to be LTS and plan
ahead accordingly.

If you feel making such a statement actually hurts the kernel project as
a whole, or sort of steers people into cramming all of their desired
features/bug fixes towards particular versions of the kernel that may,
or may not be 6 years LTS, that may be an argument against announcing
before, but maybe not after the kernel is released?

This really depends on which market you are in we have (Set-top-box and
cable modem) customers that do *want* to use newer kernels but are so
slow in adopting new ones that by the time they start the kernel has
already been phased out 2 years ago.

We have worked (and are still working) with a customer who wanted so
badly 4.1 they rattled our whole organization and had my team on call to
get there, only to start working on it seriously in 2019. The problem
was not necessarily the SoC vendor but the various OEMs and their bigger
pile of out of tree patches and the fact that the platforms were so old
that the essential knowledge of all of their little details was gone
(fired, retired, moved on) already.

6 years provides a great window of time for people to get to a quality
production with the kernel while offering enough time for slow users to
transition over and yet still have a comfortable window of updates. 2
years is a bit too short and will result in the SoC vendor or whoever
gets paid for to either continue support and maybe endorse the
responsibility of doing critical back ports themselves (meltdown,
spectre, etc.) with all the implied liability, or completely drop
support for the unmaintained kernel. In both situations, the device's
security is not as great as if a 6 years LTS kernel had been chosen.

People who can jump on the 2 year stable kernel will, and those who
cannot will not, so having 6 years is a good way to avoid skipping too
much yet try to live with what is/was current at the time.

I cannot comment on Scott's plan since we don't work in the same
business group, however we have active customers on Set-top-box and
cable modem devices that actively use the 4.9, start adopting 5.4 now
and by the end of this year the 5.10 kernel and I believe you do see me
requesting specific patches to be included once in a while ;). These
customers are a mix of RDK video, Android and just custom made Linux,
they all want a 6 years LTS kernel though because it puts them on a
support timeline they can work with given their pace and kernel expertise.

We may get paid extra money by said customers to keep maintaining
whatever old kernel they have because it still is cheaper for them than
doing new shipments and deployments of devices in the field. This means
we sell fewer devices to them for a while, but by the same token we have
exclusivity for a while and do not yet open up a window for a new
project to be with a different vendor. Is not that great conflict of
self interest?

The other thing that we have seen, especially with Android is that you
start a project on one of the 3 kernels maintained at the time, get to
market, get maintenance updates on a branch (so many branches) and
that's it, no more updates for you, which is where the 6 year LTS is
sort of handy.

PS: the usual stuff: I am not expressing ideas from my employer here,
just my own.
