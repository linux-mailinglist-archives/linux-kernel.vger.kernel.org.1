It would be still fine. The lruvec->lru_lock will be checked again before
we take and use it. 
And this lock will optimized in patch 19th which did by Hugh Dickins.

I had tried once, but the freeing page cross onto release_pages which hard to deal with.
I am very glad to wait your patch, and hope it could be resovled. :)
