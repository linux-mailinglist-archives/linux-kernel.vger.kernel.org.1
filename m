Getting into the time machine back to the 1990s...

DYNIX/ptx had a discretionary mechanism to deal with excessive interrupts.
There was a function that long-running interrupt handlers were supposed
to call periodically that would return false if the system felt that
the CPU had done enough interrupts for the time being.  In that case,
the interrupt handler was supposed to schedule itself for a later time,
but leave the interrupt unacknowledged in order to prevent retriggering
in the meantime.

Of course, this mechanism would be rather less helpful in Linux.

For one, Linux has way more device drivers and way more oddball devices.
In contrast, the few devices that DYNIX/ptx supported were carefully
selected, and the selection criteria included being able to put up
with this sort of thing.  Also, the fact that there was but a handful
of device drivers meant that changes like this could be more easily
propagated through all drivers.

Also, Linux supports way more workloads.  In contrast, DYNIX/ptx could
pick a small percentage of each CPU that would be permitted to be used
by hardware interrupt handlers.  As in there are probably Linux workloads
that run >90% of some poor CPU within hardware interrupt handlers.

But reminiscing anyway on the off-chance that this inspires someone
to come up with an idea that would work well in the Linux environment.
