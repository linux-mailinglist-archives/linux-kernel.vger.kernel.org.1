But it's very similar to what mempools are for.

Only by duplicating some of the logic in get_page_from_freelist would
protect the reserves. Even if you had that, the contents of the pcp
pools can easily be zero for the local CPU and you still get stuck.

Scheduler latency would be a problem. You would have to keep an emergency
"rescue" pool that is enough to make slow progress even if no other memory
is available until the worker takes action. The worker that allocates
pages from regular context would be to increase the pool size enough so
the emergency reserve does not have to be used again in the near future.

Fair enough but any solution that depends on the PCP having even one
page available is going to need a fallback option of some sort.

And if the pcp lists are empty, this problem still exists -- pretty much
anything that depends on the pcp lists always having pages is going to
have a failure case.

I didn't keep up to date unfortunately but pretty much anything that
needs guaranteed access to pages has to maintain a mempool of some sort.
Even if the page allocator had a common pool for emergency use, it would
be subject to abuse because all it would take is one driver or subsystem
deciding that it was special enough to deplete it. For example, the ml4
driver decided that it should declare itself to be a "memory allocator"
like kswapd for iSCSI (it claims swap-over-nfs, but swap-over-nfs was
only meant to apply when a swapfile was backed by a network fs).
