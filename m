The problem is that the kernel can run on all types of systems. It's impossible
to pick one value that fits all. Userspace must manage these priorities, and
you can still export the TID to help with that.

But why do you need several priorities in your pipeline? I would have thought
it should execute each stage sequentially and all tasks running at the same RT
priority is fine.

On SMP priorities matter once you've overcomitted the systems. You need to have
more RT tasks running than CPUs for priorities to matter. It seems you have
a high count of RT tasks in your system?

I did some profiles on Android and found that being overcomitted is hard. But
that was a while ago.

Why are they at different priorities? Different priority levels means that some
of them have more urgent deadlines to meet and it's okay to steal execution
time from lower priority tasks. Is this the case?

RT planning and partitioning is not easy task for sure. You might want to
consider using affinities too to get stronger guarantees for some tasks and
prevent cross-talking.

By userspace here I think you mean none display pipeline related RT tasks that
you need to coexit with and could still disrupt your pipeline?

Using RT on Gerneral Purpose System is hard for sure. One of the major
challenge is that there's no admin that has full view of the system to do
proper RT planning.

We need proper RT balancer daemon that helps partitioning the system for
multiple RT apps on these systems..

Ah okay. Sorry I got it the wrong way around for some reason. I thought this
task is preempting other CFS-based pipelined tasks.

So your system seems to be overcomitted. Is SF short for SufraceFlinger? Under
what scenarios do you have many SurfaceFlinger tasks? On Android I remember
seeing they have priority of 1 or 2.

sched_set_fifo() will use priority 50. If you set all your pipeline tasks
to this priority, what happens?

We were present in the room with Alessio when he gave that talk :-)

You might have seen Valentin's talk in LPC where he's trying to get
proxy-execution into shape. Which is a pre-requisite to enable using of
SCHED_DEADLINE for these scenarios. IIRC it should allow all dependent tasks to
run from the context of the deadline task during the display pipeline critical
section.

By the way, do you have issues with SoftIrqs delaying your RT tasks execution
time?
