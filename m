Yeah, page ready can be handled asynchronously. I think it would be
nice for x86/arm64 to share same design. x86 has 256 vectors and it
seems 0xec is picked for the purpose. However, arm64 doesn't have so
many (interrupt/exception) vectors and PPI might be appropriate for
the purpose if I'm correct, because it has same INTD for all CPUs.
 From this point, it's similar to x86's vector. There are 16 PPIs, which
are in range of 16 to 31, and we might reserve one for this. According
to GICv3/v4 spec, 22 - 30 have been assigned.

Well, a subclass of ESR exception code, whose DFSC (Data Fault Status
Code) is 0x34, was taken for the purpose in RFCv1. The code is IMPDEF
one and Mark suggested not to do so. I agree the page not present needs a
separately subclass of exception. With that, there will be less conflicts
and complexity. However, the question is which subclass or DFSC code I should
used for the purpose.

Sorry, Paolo, I don't follow your idea here. Could you please provide
more details?

Yeah, I don't consider it so far.

Sure.
