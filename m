/dev/sgx/provision is root-only by default, the expectation is that the admin
will configure the system to grant only specific enclaves access to the
PROVISION_KEY.

The basic gist is that the host process of an enclave that needs/wants access
to the PROVISION_KEY will invoke SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_SET_ATTRIBUTE when building
the enclave.  Any enclave can request access to PROVISION_KEY, but practically
speaking only the PCE and QE (or their non-Intel equivalents) actually need
access to the key.  KVM (future series) will also respect /dev/sgx/provision,
i.e. require a similar ioctl() to expose the PROVISION_KEY to a guest.

E.g. for my own personal testing, I never do anything attestation related, so
none of the enclaves I run request PROVISION_KEY, but I do expose it to VMs to
test the KVM paths.

In this series, access is fairly binary, i.e. there's no additional kernel
infrastructure to help userspace make per-enclave decisions.  There have been
more than a few proposals on how to extend the kernel to help provide better
granularity, e.g. LSM hooks, but it was generally agreed to punt that stuff
to post-upstreaming to keep things "simple" once we went far enough down
various paths to ensure we weren't painting ourselves into a corner.

If you want super gory details, Intel's whitepaper on attestation in cloud
environments is a good starting point[*], but I don't recommended doing much
more than skimming unless you really like attestation stuff or are
masochistic, which IMO amount to the same thing :-)
