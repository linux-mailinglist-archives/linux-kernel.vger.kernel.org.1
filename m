This sounds all too familiar.

This kind of thing is something that ARM have seems to shy away from
doing - it's a point I brought up many years ago when the whole
trustzone thing first appeared with its SMC call.  Those around the
conference table were not interested - ARM seemed to prefer every
vendor to do off and do their own thing with the SMC interface.

Then OMAP came along with its SMC interfaces, and so did the pain of
not having a standardised way to configure the L2C when Linux was
running in the non-secure world, resulting in stuff like l2c_configure
etc, where each and every implementation has to supply a function to
call its platform specific SMC interfaces to configure a piece of
hardware common across many different platforms.

ARM have seemed reluctant to standardise on stuff like this, so
unless someone pushes hard for it from inside ARM, I doubt it will
ever happen.
