Makes sense.

I'll take a look if Will doesn't beat me to it, and I'm happy to test
the result regardless.

I *think* removing that should be largely mechanical for someone
for someone familiar with it, and it'd be nice to see it go.

I'll see what I can do.

At first glance it looks like we might need to flesh out or refactor the
arm64 kernel maccess routines first (since we want the user maccess
routines to use LDTR/STTR instructions that can't access kernel memory),
but after that I think the rest is largely mechanical.

Mark.
