Yes, it will issue message-queue related hypercalls

A stage-2 fault would be considered fatal normally and result in termination of
guest. Modifying that behavior to allow resumption in case of virtio config
space access, especially including the untrusted VM in this flow, is
perhaps the concern. HVC calls OTOH are more vetted interfaces that the
hypervisor has to do nothing additional to handle.

Let me check with our hypervisor folks again. Thanks for your inputs.
