No.  Once it=E2=80=99s merged, people will write user code using the ABI, an=
d that means we need to get the ABI right.

The very early versions had severely problematic ABIs. The new ones are prob=
ably okay except for, maybe, ptrace.  If we had merged the old ones, then we=
 might have gotten stuck with the old, problematic ABI.
