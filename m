Ping on this discussion. TI is participating on the System DT evolution 
in general, but we don't have any plans to use DTS on our remote cores. 
We have our own auto-generated Chip-Support-Library (CSL) code that gets 
used on our firmwares.

Also, most of the properties I defined are rather standard properties. I 
have posted a revised v3 [1] after the common ti,sci properties 
refactoring. This series is only waiting on the bindings. I am happy to 
change any ti, prefixed properties. I had one open question [2] that I 
am waiting for a response from you for identifying the R5F Core.

regards
Suman
