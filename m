Having these symbols exported to modules should simplify generating file
content for pseudo file systems like sysfs or procfs. Many of the in
kernel modules export atleast one such attribute file. Using seq_buf
api provides a safe way to populate the read buffers for these attrs
as these string buffers are PAGE_SIZE in length and a buggy module can
easily cause an overflow.

My specific use-case is exporting a set of nvdimm specific flags from
papr_scm kernel module [1] via sysfs through a patch proposed at [2] and
using seq_buf should considerably simply my code as suggested by Mpe
at [3].
