So what is your opinion on ssid? I dont mind removing them
now since people dont like it and the strong use-case is not
strong (yet). Is there any problem to put getting them back
later if useful? And then before the strings so the evaluation
of filter first come on number before stings Or is there already
some mechanism that optimize for that?
