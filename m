Which control bits are those? ISOC-First, Chain and Last bits?

I see the Scatter-Gather preparation is using these pattern.

Right, for now the drivers is doing:

- Strart Transfer (with the right frame number) once.

- Update Transfer On every ep_queue with the corresponding TRB
  setting CHN =3D 0, IOC =3D 1, First-ISOC =3D 1

- End Transfer is somehow not handled right for this case.

See my first comment. I think dwc3_prepare_one_trb_sg does the proper chain
handling already.

Can the UVC not just enqueue one big sg-request, which will represent one b=
urst
and not one TRB. Also that is  what the SG code already seem to handle righ=
t.

Right. This also stops, after the Command Complete Interrupt arrives.

I don't know, probably it was more likely for USB 2.0 controllers to be han=
dled
this way.

As mentioned the current uvc code is also working when we add this changes.
