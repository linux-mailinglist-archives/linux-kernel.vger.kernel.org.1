Hmm... It seems that the current behavior (before your patch) for this
example has no problem. It causes deactivation but doesn't cause eviction
so there is no workingset thrashing.

Splitting would not fix the fundamental problem (over-eager) but it would
greatly weaken the problem. Just counting IO cost doesn't break the
active/inactive separation in file list. It does cause more scan on anon li=
st
but I think that it's endurable.

Yes, taking anon age into account is also a good candidate to fix the probl=
em.

Okay.

Much better! It may solve my concern mostly.

But, I still think that modified refault activation equation isn't
safe. The next
problem I found is related to the scan ratio limit patch ("limit the range =
of
LRU type balancing") on this series. See the below example.

anon: Hot (X M)
file: Hot (200 M) / dummy (200 M)
P: 1200 M (3 parts, each one 400 M, P1, P2, P3)
Access Pattern: A -> F(H) -> P1 -> A -> F(H) -> P2 -> ... ->

Without this patch, A and F(H) are kept on the memory and look like
it's correct.

With this patch and below fix, refault equation for Pn would be:

Refault dist of Pn =3D 1200 (from file non-resident) + 1200 * anon scan
ratio (from anon non-resident)
anon + active file =3D X + 200
1200 + 1200 * anon scan ratio (0.5 ~ 2) < X + 200

According to the size of X, Pn's refault result would be different. Pn coul=
d
be activated with large enough X and then F(H) could be evicted. In ideal
case (unified list), for this example, Pn should not be activated in any X.

This is a fundamental problem since we have two list type (file/anon) and
scan ratio limit is required. Anyway, we need to take care of this reality =
and
the way most safe is to count IO cost instead of doing activation in this
'non-resident dist < (active + anon list)' case.

Again, for this patch, I'm not confident myself so please let me know if I'=
m
wrong.

Thanks.
