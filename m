Right, and neither do I, but sadly hotplug is one of those things that we
have to take into account :(

To properly update the SD landscape (i.e. the cached pointers), we *need*
that update_top_cache_domain() call. But then there's also the hotplug
thing, so we would need to e.g. write back the flags values into the right
topology level of sched_domain_topology.

I can see value in it for testing, but I'm not convinced it is something we
want to open up again. At least it's not too complicated to automate
testing of different flag combinations - you just need to commit some
change to the topology flags (either default_topology or whatever your arch
uses).
