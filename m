The point is that for threaded interrupts (without a primary handler)
the core needs to be told that the interrupt line should be masked until
the threaded handler finished. That's what IRQF_ONESHOT is for.

For interrupts which have both a primary and a threaded handler that's a
different story. The primary handler decides whether the thread should
be woken and it decides whether to block further interrupt delivery in
the device or keep it enabled.

When forced interrupt threading is enabled (even independent of RT) then
we have the following cases:

  1) Regular device interrupt (primary handler only)

     The primary handler is replaced with the default 'wake up thread'
     handler and the original primary handler becomes the threaded
     handler. This enforces IRQF_ONESHOT so that the interupt line (for
     level interrupts) stays masked until the thread completed handling.

  2) Threaded interrupts

     Interrupts which have been requested as threaded handler (no
     primary handler) are not changed obvioulsy

  3) Interrupts which have both a primary and a thread handler

     Here IRQF_ONESHOT decides whether the primary handler will be
     forced threaded or not.

     That's a bit unfortunate and ill defined and was not intended to be
     used that way.

     We rather should make interrupts which need to have their primary
     handler in hard interrupt context to set IRQF_NO_THREAD. That
     should at the same time confirm that the primary handler is RT
     safe.

     Let me stare at the core code and the actual usage sites some more.

Thanks,
