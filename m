Why is it a change? We've never reported e.g. "java" on an arm64 kernel, so
I agree with Dave that we shouldn't be adding this string. If it /ever/ ends
up in userspace it's because something has gone horribly wrong. NULL would
be much better. Couldn't you achieve that by simply omitting these entries?
e.g. deleting things like:

	[COMPAT_KERNEL_HWCAP(JAVA)]     = "java",

completely (including the COMPAT_HWCAP_JAVA definition)?

SWP is fine because we emulate it and so userspace can use it. Removing that
*would* be a change in behaviour. I don't think the compat ABI is broken
here, so please don't change it without good reason.
