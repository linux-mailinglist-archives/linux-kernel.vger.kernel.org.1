correct, we have unique requests in non-batch caches.

correct there is only one client interconnect using batch API.

On upstream interconnect i see they are using batch only requests till now.

I agree to remove find_match() completly, and we can see in future if 
interconnect driver starts using non-batch APIs as well then we can 
introduce a check to find duplicates.
