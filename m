I think you are reading some statements in isolation that probably are
causing some confusion.
EDU design has a flaw in case of reported  ECC error interrupt in that
corrected data is not transferred to the DMA buffer. The PIO is needed
to read corrected data into the NAND data buffer and only for the
reported errors. So there is no need to change the threshold
calculation logic, if we get rid of the threshold then we will have to
do the PIO read on any correctable bit error if it occurs during EDU
reads.

Maybe that statement was a bit misleading. To be clear when an ECC
error is reported the controller gives the bit_flips count  as well as
updates the ECC error address Register and ecc error status registers.
This logic works as expected in the hardware.

 It's the other way. The controller only reports bit errors beyond
>=3Dthreshold value, will not report otherwise and silently correct the
data. There is no problem in  cases where erros are corrected
silently. Now ECC (un)correctable on EDU reads are detected by simply
reading back the ECC Error address register. And in case of reported
uncorrectable ECC errors are treated as usual.  And for reported
correctable ECC errors we need to read the page again using PIO so
that the corrected data is properly transferred. All this applies to
EDU transfer only.
