Is the following commit log better?

    split_huge_page() will never call on a page which isn't on lru list, so
    this code never got a chance to run, and should not be run, to add tail
    pages on a lru list which head page isn't there.

    Hugh Dickins' mentioned:
    The path should never be called since lru_add_page_tail() being called
    while head refcount is frozen to 0: we would not get this far if someone
    else holds a reference to the THP - which they must hold if they have
    isolated the page from its lru.

    Although the bug was never triggered, it'better be removed for code
    correctness, and add a warn for unexpected calling.

No, what I mean is only PageLRU(head) could be called and get here. Would you
like to give a suggestion to replace old one?

It's no much related with theme, so I'm fine to remove it.

I don't know the details of lockdep show. Just wondering could it possible 
to solid the move_lock/lru_lock sequence?
or try other blocking way which mentioned in commit_charge()?

this patch could give about 10+% performance gain on my multiple memcg
readtwice testing. fairness locking cost the performance much.

I also tried per cpu solution but that cause much trouble of per cpu func
things, and looks no benefit except a bit struct size of stack, so if 
stack size still fine. May we could use the solution and improve it better.
like, functionlize, fix the reverse issue etc.

Uh, let me rethink about this. anyway the patch is logically different from
patch 20 since it's need a new function lruvec_holds_page_lru_lock.
