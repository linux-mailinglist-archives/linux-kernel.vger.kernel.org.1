Mixed results, maybe you can provide some guidance.  Running this
against v5.8-rc4, I haven't reproduced the glitch.  But it's been a
long time since I tested this previously, so I went back to v5.3-rc5 to
make sure I still have a recipe to trigger it.  I can still get the
failure there as the selective flush commit was reverted in rc6.  Then
I wondered, can I take broken v5.3-rc5 and apply this fix to prove that
it works?  No, v5.3-rc5 + this patch still glitches.  So I thought
maybe I could make v5.8-rc4 break by s/true/false/ in this patch.
Nope.  Then I applied the original patch from[1] to try to break it.
Nope.  So if anything, I think the evidence suggests this was broken
elsewhere and is now fixed, or maybe it is a timing issue that I can't
trigger on newer kernels.  If the reproducer wasn't so touchy and time
consuming, I'd try to bisect, but I don't have that sort of bandwidth.
Thanks,

Alex
