for (n = 0; n < num_pages; n++)
	pin_user_page()

may call try_to_unmap_page from the lru shrinker for [0, n-1].

We're in the middle of allocating the object, how are we best to untangle
that?

Or during allocation of something that is using the pages pinned by that
object, how are we best to not to shrink that object as there is a
mutual dependency?
