The better question is, what features should an arch add to not need
the linker trick ;-)

That is, they need to change it so that they add the two parameters
that is expected by the ftrace core code. Once they do that, then they
don't need to use the linker trick, and no function typecast is needed.

In other-words, if they support the ftrace_ops and regs passing, they
can define ARCH_SUPPORTS_FTRACE_OPS. Note, they don't even really need
to support the regs, (can just send NULL), if they don't have
HAVE_DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS.

Which BTW, is supported by the following architectures:

  arm
  arm64
  csky
  parisc
  powerpc
  riscv
  s390
  x86

All of the above architectures should not even be hitting the code that
does the function cast. What architecture are you doing all this for?
