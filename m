Good to know, thank you!

You can't have everything!  ;-)

Have you tried using sysreq-t to see what the various tasks are doing?

One way that this can happen is if whatever task is currently running
has managed to enter long loop with interrupts disabled.

Having interrupts disabled on all CPUs would have the effect of disabling
the RCU CPU stall warnings.

The intended method is in Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt.
Search for rcu_cpu_stall_suppress.  Not that it seems important at this
point.
