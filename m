We have [0]. (Search for "Ouch.")

The comment says why it is necessary. The previous read of the block ID
cannot be trusted if the the tail has been pushed beyond it.

In your email from our previous discussion, you pointed out that two
writers could race to allocate a block and the loser would start freeing
the winner's data because it gets a valid block ID to a descriptor in
the committed state that points back to the block lpos.

You wrote:

That is what this check is doing. If the tail has been pushed beyond the
block, we cannot trust the block ID read because that area may have been
recycled already.

You are correct. I am ashamed about this misuse. I will add the variable
and rely on the compiler to appropriately merge/recycle stack variables.
