The other subtlety is that UDF is a *mnemonic* for a specific encoding 
with cond=0b1110, thus "conditional UDF" is an oxymoron. You can still 
have a conditional instruction from the "permanently undefined" space 
(although on Armv7-A it's implementation-defined whether it causes an 
exception regardless of the condition), it's just not a UDF.
