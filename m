Indeed, a looooong time ago... Before DRM existed.

AFAIU, most of these are triggered by VT ioctls.
There is an intimate relation between the VT and fbev subsystems: VT
changes impact fbdev, and vice versa.

Perhaps these should be decoupled, at the expense of worse user
experience (i.e. the user needing to change both screen resolution and
number of columns/rows of the text console)?

I'm not that intimate familiar anymore with the current state of the
code, but it used to be like this:
  - vgacon used a VRAM buffer for the current VC, and multiple shadow
    buffers to implement virtual consoles,
  - fbcon always used the shadow buffers, with each update triggering
    an update of the frame buffer (see below).

As the text console buffer handling should be the same for vgacon and
fbcon, I expect most scrollback bugs (if any) to be present in both.

There are multiple ways to implement scrolling:
  1. If the hardware supports a larger virtual screen and panning, and
     the virtual screen is enabled, most scrolling can be implemented by
     panning, with a casual copy when reaching the bottom (or top) of
     the virtual screen.
     This mode is (was) available on most graphics hardware with
     dedicated graphics memory.
  2. If a 2D acceleration engine is available, copying (and
     clearing/filling) can be implemented by rectangle copy/fill
     operations.
  3. Rectangle copy/fill by the CPU is always available.
  4. Redrawing characters by the CPU is always available.

Which option was used depended on the hardware: not all options are
available everywhere, and some perform better than others.
E.g. on PCI graphics cards, reading graphics memory by the CPU is
usually very slow, so option 3 is much slower than option 4 (given a
sufficiently fast CPU).
AFAIU, option 2 is not suitable for modern systems with 3D acceleration.
On the older (slower) systems (lacking VGA text mode) for which fbcon
was originally written, option 4 is usually the slowest.

Support for 1-3 were removed in commit 39aead8373b3c20b ("fbcon: Disable
accelerated scrolling"), which claimed only 3 (DRM) drivers made use of
this, ignoring the other 32 (fbdev) drivers making use of it.
