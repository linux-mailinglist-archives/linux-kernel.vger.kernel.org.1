D'oh, I took your silence as "no objections". Oh well!

Ok, cheers. It's on a separate branch so it's easy enough to drop if
necessary (i.e. no reverts needed). Sudeep -- please send any extra patches
on top of the branch.

I saw that when I applied the patches, but since the function is called from
another compilation unit (psci/psci.o), I just ignored it as we have loads
of these already and it only screams if you build with W=1.
