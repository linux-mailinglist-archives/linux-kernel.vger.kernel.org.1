I was a bit more optimistic about this series until I saw the
copy_user_fixup.S changes (patches 12 to 14). I have a suspicion it's
only Oli (and maybe Robin) who understands it, so from a maintainer's
perspective it doesn't really scale. It's also very fragile with any
minor tweak in the actual copy routine potentially breaking the fixup
code.

I think that's probably the best option. I wouldn't mind replacing the
in-kernel memcpy/strcpy etc. with these patches since the work was done
already but definitely not for the uaccess and fixup routines (we still
have the original implementation in the git log).

A script would work even better. Do we have any issue with licensing
though? Cortex Strings is BSD (3-clause IIRC) and copyright owned by
Linaro. I got them to officially agree with relicensing (dual license)
the latest copy under GPLv2 so that we can contribute it to the kernel.
But since the project license is still BSD, any future updates in there
are BSD-only.

Maybe someone who understands this stuff can confirm that it's ok to
regularly grab the Cortex Strings files into a GPLv2 codebase without
asking for Linaro's permission.

BTW, you could pick the kprobes patch in here, that explicit fixup call
is not necessary.
