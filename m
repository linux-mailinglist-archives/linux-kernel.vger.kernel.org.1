Hi Linus,

Please pull this sizeable pile of arm64 updates for 5.8. Summary in the tag,
but the big two features are support for Branch Target Identification and
Clang's Shadow Call stack. The latter is currently arm64-only, but the
high-level parts are all in core code so it could easily be adopted by
other architectures pending toolchain support.

Please note that this includes the x86/asm branch from -tip due to a
dependency from the BTI code on the new 'CONFIG_ARCH_USE_SYM_ANNOTATIONS'
option. I've left that in the diffstat below because it's only two commits.

Cheers,

Will

  Merge branch 'for-next/scs' into for-next/core (2020-05-28 18:03:40 +0100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
arm64 updates for 5.8

- Branch Target Identification (BTI)
	* Support for ARMv8.5-BTI in both user- and kernel-space. This
	  allows branch targets to limit the types of branch from which
	  they can be called and additionally prevents branching to
	  arbitrary code, although kernel support requires a very recent
	  toolchain.

	* Function annotation via SYM_FUNC_START() so that assembly
	  functions are wrapped with the relevant "landing pad"
	  instructions.

	* BPF and vDSO updates to use the new instructions.

	* Addition of a new HWCAP and exposure of BTI capability to
	  userspace via ID register emulation, along with ELF loader
	  support for the BTI feature in .note.gnu.property.

	* Non-critical fixes to CFI unwind annotations in the sigreturn
	  trampoline.

- Shadow Call Stack (SCS)
	* Support for Clang's Shadow Call Stack feature, which reserves
	  platform register x18 to point at a separate stack for each
	  task that holds only return addresses. This protects function
	  return control flow from buffer overruns on the main stack.

	* Save/restore of x18 across problematic boundaries (user-mode,
	  hypervisor, EFI, suspend, etc).

	* Core support for SCS, should other architectures want to use it
	  too.

	* SCS overflow checking on context-switch as part of the existing
	  stack limit check if CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK=y.

- CPU feature detection
	* Removed numerous "SANITY CHECK" errors when running on a system
	  with mismatched AArch32 support at EL1. This is primarily a
	  concern for KVM, which disabled support for 32-bit guests on
	  such a system.

	* Addition of new ID registers and fields as the architecture has
	  been extended.

- Perf and PMU drivers
	* Minor fixes and cleanups to system PMU drivers.

- Hardware errata
	* Unify KVM workarounds for VHE and nVHE configurations.

	* Sort vendor errata entries in Kconfig.

- Secure Monitor Call Calling Convention (SMCCC)
	* Update to the latest specification from Arm (v1.2).

	* Allow PSCI code to query the SMCCC version.

- Software Delegated Exception Interface (SDEI)
	* Unexport a bunch of unused symbols.

	* Minor fixes to handling of firmware data.

- Pointer authentication
	* Add support for dumping the kernel PAC mask in vmcoreinfo so
	  that the stack can be unwound by tools such as kdump.

	* Simplification of key initialisation during CPU bringup.

- BPF backend
	* Improve immediate generation for logical and add/sub
	  instructions.

- vDSO
	- Minor fixes to the linker flags for consistency with other
	  architectures and support for LLVM's unwinder.

	- Clean up logic to initialise and map the vDSO into userspace.

- ACPI
	- Work around for an ambiguity in the IORT specification relating
	  to the "num_ids" field.

	- Support _DMA method for all named components rather than only
	  PCIe root complexes.

	- Minor other IORT-related fixes.

- Miscellaneous
	* Initialise debug traps early for KGDB and fix KDB cacheflushing
	  deadlock.

	* Minor tweaks to early boot state (documentation update, set
	  TEXT_OFFSET to 0x0, increase alignment of PE/COFF sections).

	* Refactoring and cleanup
