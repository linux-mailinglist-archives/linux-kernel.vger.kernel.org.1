Hi Alexander,

Thanks a lot for comments and suggestions!

I have tried your suggestion:

Performance of case-lru-file-mmap-read in vm-scalibity is dropped a bit. not
helpful

It increase a bit crowd here, but lru_lock do reduce some them, and skip_bit
could stop each other in a array check(bitmap). So compare to whole node 
lru_lock, the net profit is clear in patch 17.

Is this good for only one process could do test_and_set_skip? is that 
the 'skip' meaning to be?

It make the things warse in my machine, would you like to have a try by yourself?

The lruvec could be wrong or NULL here, that is the base stone of whole
patchset.

I have tried the patch as your suggested, it has no clear help on performance
on above vm-scaliblity case. Maybe it's due to we checked the same thing
before lock already.
