Nowadays we are looking at reclaim cost on high utilization
machines/devices and noticed that rmap walk takes more than 60/70% of
the CPU cost of the reclaim. Kernel does rmap walks in
shrink_active_list and shrink_page_list and pgscan and pgrefill are
good approximations of the number of rmap walks during a reclaim.

Actually I would prefer adding memory.stat at the root cgroup level as
you noted below that more use-cases would benefit from it.

Thanks for the feedback. I will send the patch with the additional motivation.
