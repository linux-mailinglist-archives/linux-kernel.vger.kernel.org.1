Hi Russel/Valentin

The feature itself like Valentin explained below allows scheduler to be 
aware of cpu capacity reduced due to thermal throttling. 
arch_set_thermal_pressure feeds the capped capacity to the scheduler and 
hence the feature makes sense only if arch_set_thermal_pressure is 
implemented. Having said that arch_set_thermal_pressure is implemented 
in arch_topology driver for arm and arm64 platforms. But the feature 
itself is not bound to arm/arm64 platforms. So it would make it wrong to 
add a "depends on (ARM || ARM64) option."

I agree with Vincent that allowing user to choose this option is 
probably not the best. IMO, this should be enabled by default in arm64 
defconfig considering both GENERIC_ARCH_TOPOLOGY and CPU_FREQ_THERMAL 
are enabled by default.
So if it is acceptable three things to be done are:
1. Add the help text.
2. Don't allow SCHED_THERMAL_PRESSURE configurable by user
3. Enable it by default in arm64 defconfig
