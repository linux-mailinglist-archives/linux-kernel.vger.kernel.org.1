Long story short I messed up my pull-request to Greg and had to back out
the patch anyways. In retrospect I think the patch should have gone
through your tree anyways, so here's our chance to get it right.

Feel free to take it with the rest of the changes through your tree.

Note: When I applied the patch I fixed up the whitespace that checkpatch
complained about so you might want to do that (or ask Alexandru to
resend the patch).

Acked-by: Moritz Fischer <mdf@kernel.org>

Sorry for the confusion and let me know if you still prefer a signed
tag.

- Moritz
