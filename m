Well to be honest, this kind of sucks. I've been posting it since May,
and the ideal approach would have been to just ack it and I could have
carried it in my tree. That's what we did for btrfs and XFS, both of
which have it.

The required patches *were* upstreamed on August 3rd, which is why I
mentioned that. But yes, not in 5.8 or earlier, of course.

So I suggest that you either include it for the next pull request for
Linus, or that I put it in with your ack. Either is fine with me. I'd
consider this a "dropping the ball" kind of thing, it's not like the
patch hasn't been in linux-next or hasn't been ready for months. This
isn't some "oh I wrote this feature after the merge window" event. It'd
be a real shame to ship 5.9 and ext4 not have support for the more
efficient async buffered reads, imho, especially since the two other
major local file systems already have it.

Let me know what you think.
