Oh, I thought he was referring to a different patch. Kees, could I get
your confirmation on this?

The change I made actually affected all of the DRM code, although this coul=
d
easily be changed to be specific to amdgpu. (By forcing blocking on
amdgpu_dm's non-blocking commit code)

That said, I'd still need to test further because I only did test it for a
couple of hours then. Although it should work in theory.

The base/context swap idea should make the use-after-free behave how it
did in 5.6. Since the bug doesn't cause an issue in 5.6, it's less of a
"less disturbance" workaround and more of a "no disturbance" workaround.

Thanks,
