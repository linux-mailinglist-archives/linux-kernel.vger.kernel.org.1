This is a very nice feature IMO, and it should be far more effective 
at randomizing the kernel, due to the sheer number of randomization 
bits that kernel function granular randomization presents.

If this is a good approximation of fg-kaslr randomization depth:

  thule:~/tip> grep ' [tT] ' /proc/kallsyms  | wc -l
  88488

... then that's 80K bits of randomization instead of the mere handful 
of kaslr bits we have today. Very nice!

Neat. :-)

I'd guess that the biggest performance impact comes from tearing apart 
'groups' of functions that particular workloads are using.

In that sense it might be worthwile to add a '__kaslr_group' function 
tag to key functions, which would keep certain performance critical 
functions next to each other.

This shouldn't really be a problem, as even with generous amount of 
grouping the number of randomization bits is incredibly large.

I'm pretty sure the 'grouping' solution would address any real 
slowdowns.

I'd also suggest allowing the passing in of a boot-time pseudo-random 
generator seed number, which would allow the creation of a 
pseudo-randomized but repeatable layout across reboots.

What is the increase of the resulting raw kernel image? Additional 
relocations might increase its size (unless I'm missing something) - 
it would be nice to measure this effect. I'd expect this to be really 
low.

vmlinux or compressed kernel size doesn't really matter on x86-64, 
it's a boot time only expense well within typical system resource 
limits.

I'd suggest to also add a 'nofgkaslr' boot option if it doesn't yet 
exist, to keep usage symmetric with kaslr.

Likewise, there should probably be a 'kaslr=off' option as well.

The less random our user interfaces are, the better ...

This looks surprisingly lean overall.
