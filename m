What is being prevented from merging at this moment because of this?

There is always ebbs and flows with patch reviews, what do you consider
"manditory" time to review a patch from a maintainer?

Remember, we are almost all doing this not as our paid job, but as part
of what we do.

And to be frank, I personally have been putting the fpga patchset at the
_end_ of my reviews because of the quality of them in the past.  While
it is slowly getting better, you all have a big hole to dig out from,
and maybe you need to step up your reviews to raise that bar so I don't
dread seeing them in my review queue :)

> It would be good if the big first reviews could be done in parallel.

parallel with what?

All I'm getting here is "I wish patches were accepted faster!" from you.
When personally, I think they are being accepted at a very nice rate for
such a tiny subsystem.

Good luck with your reviews,
