Well, gEDF could take asymmetric capacities into account by scheduling
the earliest deadline task on the fastest CPU (and the task with the
second earliest deadline on the second fastest CPU, and so on...)

But this could cause a lot of unneeded migrations (I tried to discuss
this issue in a previous OSPM presentation). My original approach to
work around this issue was to schedule a task on the slowest core on
which the task can fit (some experiments revealed that this heuristic
can approximate the gEDF behaviour without causing too many
migrations)... But this patch is not included on the current patchset,
and will be proposed later, after the most important patches have been
merged.

In theory, if the task is scheduled on a core that is too slow for it
then we must allow faster cores to pull it later (when tasks with
earlier deadlines block). But this might be problematic, because it can
require to migrate a currently scheduled task.
