I updated my upstream-based sm8150/sm8250 displayport stack [1] to use 
these patches.

This commit [2] might interest you, so that you can consider what needs 
to change between v3 and v4 PHYs. Note some of the V4 registers have the 
same address as V3, so the diff could be smaller.

Do you have any plan for dealing with the SS PHY and DP PHY conflicting 
with each other? For example, PHY_MODE_CTRL needs to be "DP_MODE" for 
4-lane DP, "DP_MODE | USB3_MODE" for 2-lane DP + USB3, and (AFAIK) 
"USB3_MODE" for superspeedplus usb (and it seems this gates some clocks, 
so you can't read/write dp tx2 registers in 2-lane DP mode for example). 
 From your cover letter it sounds like this isn't relevant to your 
hardware, but it looks like both PHYs are writing to the dp_com region 
which is still problematic. (in the branch I linked, I disabled the SS 
PHY to test the DP PHY)

Also some issues I noticed:
- used QSERDES_COM_RESETSM_CNTRL instead of 
QSERDES_V3_COM_RESETSM_CNTRL2, which has different value
- in sc7180_dpphy_cfg, .regs is NULL, which results in NULL references
