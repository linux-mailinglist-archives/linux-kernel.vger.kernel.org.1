Yes the final user doesn't care if it's sun50i A64 HDMI or sun50i H6
HDMI, but like Maxime said between final user and the sound-card name
you may want to have a configuration layer.
This configuration layer can apply different settings depending on the
sound card.
Having too generic name will make impossible specific card configuration.

Also you can have specific name per board which can be quite clear for
final user.
 - sun50i-a64-hdmi
 - sun50i-a64-spdif
is not so hard to understand that one point to the HDMI whereas the
other point to SPDIF.

Clement
