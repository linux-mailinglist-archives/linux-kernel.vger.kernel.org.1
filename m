I had been under the (seemingly very wrong) understanding that when
all the tasks associated with a filter cease to exist, the notif fd is
effectively closed. But I see now where I got confused: this is only
half implemented: if the userspace end of the fd is closed, it'll get
cleaned up in the kernel, but we have nothing going the other direction
except the general object lifetime management on the filter itself.

So, yes, I accept the basic problem statement, "we have fds hanging
around that will never be used again, we need to notice that". :)

Why is EPOLLHUP needed? Can't the fd just get closed on the kernel end?
I would expect that to be visible as EPOLLHUP internally (though I
haven't looked through the VFS yet). And I haven't found how to
close/detach a anon file from the listener task. It strikes me that this
would actually be much cleaner: then we actually don't need the
additional __get_seccomp_filter() in init_listener() -- we simply
invalidate the file during __put_seccomp_filter().

(While I'm here -- why can there be only one listener per task? The
notifications are filter-specific, not task-specific?)

I will need convincing that life-cycle ref-counting needs to be decoupled
from usage ref-counting. I see what you're saying here and in the other
reply about where the notification is coming from (release vs put, etc),
but I think it'd be better if the EPOLLHUP was handled internally to the
VFS due to the kernel end of the file being closed.

I guess this is a minor size/speed trade-off (every seccomp_filter
struct grows by 1 pointer regardless of the presence of USER_NOTIF
rules attached...). But I think this is an optimization detail, and I
need to understand why we can't just close the file on filter free.
