hw-based sync is required for Intel even for single stream. It's been 
part of the recommended programming flows since the beginning but 
ignored so far.

That said, this value is set by each master implementation, no one 
forces non-Intel users to implement an Intel-specific requirement.

Because as you rightly said above, Intel requires the hw_sync to be used 
even for single stream, but we didn't want others to be forced to use 
the hw-sync for single stream. the m_rt_count is not sufficient for Intel.

I think we are in agreement on not forcing everyone to follow what is 
required by Intel, and that's precisely why we added this setting. If 
you set it to two you would only use hw_sync when two masters are used.
