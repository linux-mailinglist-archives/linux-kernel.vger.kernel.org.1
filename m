Yes, scroll down a bit, the null pointer oops followed almost
immediately after that

[   49.979043] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000090

When I did that on my desktop the tty system was pretty screwed. Mouse still
worked in X but no keyboard input possible.

It might be a bit more involved than a simple max port check, think
about hotplug (I have 16C950 ExpressCard devices I occansionally use
on one of my laptops) so there may be holes in the allocation numbers.
Not sure how/where to best solve this.

Yes, that sounds reasonable (haven't looked at ttyUSB details, only
checked serial core devices yet).

so long,
