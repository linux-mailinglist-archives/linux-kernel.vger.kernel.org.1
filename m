I am afraid that many of them could not be normal options. They change or
break some behavior that is necessary by seriously used system.

Just to make my role clear in this saga.

I am focused on the change of pr_debug() behavior. I do _not_ believe
that it is worth it. But I wanted to give fuzzer guys a chance to get
some data.

This is why I offered to push hacky patch into linux-next via printk
tree to get fuzzers fed. Such a patch would change the behavior only
for the fuzzer (with the crazy config enabled) and it would be there
only for a limited time.

I personally do _not_ have a good feeling about having such hacks in
upstream kernel. But I do not feel in position to decide about it.
I wanted to solve this question later if there would have been
anything to upstream.

I am _not_ going to push any twists, in the current form,
upstream via printk tree.

Best Regards,
Petr
