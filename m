Honestly, I am not completely familiar with the console an tty drivers
code.

Anyway, struct console is typically statically defined by the console
driver code. It is not must to have but I am not aware of any
driver where it would be dynamically defined.

On the other hand, struct tty_driver is dynamically allocated
when the driver gets initialized.

So I would say that it is pretty safe to store struct console.
Well, you need to call con->device() to see if the tty_driver
is actually initialized.
