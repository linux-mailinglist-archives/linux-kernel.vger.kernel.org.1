Thanks Bjorn, I can resend SM8150 coresight change when SMMU support 
lands for it
since coresight ETR won't work without it on android bootloaders.

As for the other 3 patches, Patch 1 and Patch 2 will apply cleanly to 
the right coresight
nodes but due to the missing unique context in Patch 3, it could be 
applied to some other node.
We had to upload this change 3 times in chromium tree to get it applied 
to the right replicator node :)
and this property in Patch 3 is important to fix a hard lockup. I'm not 
sure why this patch is missing
the proper context :/

I couldn't find the changes yet in qcom/for-next or other branches to 
see if it is
applied to right replicator node. In case you haven't applied it yet, 
Patch 3 change
should be applied to "replicator@6b06000" node.

Thanks,
Sai
