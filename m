Thanks for the hint. I'm almost certain it's due to this excerpt from
the changelog: "we now init sh_type and sh_flags for all known ABI sections
in _bfd_elf_new_section_hook."

Indeed, .plt and .text.* are listed as special sections in bfd/elf.c.
The former requires an exact match and the latter only has to match
the prefix ".text." Since the code considers ".plt" and
".text.ftrace_trampoline" special sections, their sh_type and sh_flags
are now set by default. Now I guess the question is whether this can
be overriden by a linker script..
