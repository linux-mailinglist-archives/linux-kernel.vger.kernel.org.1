Perhaps don't consider this to be "fixing schedule_work()" but providing
an NMI-safe alternative to schedule_work().

Does it look better if you create a new type to map the two structures
together. Alternatively are there enough existing use-cases to want to
extend irq_work_queue() with irq_work_schedule() or something similar?
