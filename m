Indeed, my nightmare scenario involves some sort of preemption or
similar long delay at that point.  Callbacks pile up, and then OOM!

This last seems best to me.  The transition from CBLIST_NOT_OFFLOADED
to CBLIST_OFFLOADING of course needs to be on the CPU in question with
at least bh disabled.  Probably best to be holding rcu_nocb_lock(),
but that might just be me being overly paranoid.

It looked to me like it wasn't excluding either rcu_barrier() or CPU
hotplug.  It might also not have been pinning onto the CPU in question,
but that might just be me misremembering.  Then again, I didn't see a
call to it, so maybe its callers set things up appropriately.

OK, I will bite...  What is the purpose of rcu_nocb_rdp_deoffload()?  ;-)

Agreed!  And I do believe that concurrent callback execution will
prove better than a possibly indefinite gap in callback execution.

Agreed!  ;-)

And the cpus_read_lock() in rcu_nocb_cpu_deoffload() prevents that CPU
from coming back online, so looks good!
