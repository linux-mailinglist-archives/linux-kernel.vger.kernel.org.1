It wasn't in the reverted series, it came in Intel's v9 series, with
these comments in the cover letter:

	Updates from v8 [10]:
	[...]
	* Simplified GS base helper functions (Tony L.)

And I did, Thomas. While I'm not intimately familiar with the code I
made sure that all the patches that came on top of the merged series
before it got reverted made it into this new series. However, more work
has happened here after the revert and I would expect that the code in
this new series will be different than the code you reverted last year.

Changed in v9 of the series.

(assuming we're looking at the same thing here, ) Changed in v8 of the
series.

Changed in every version after the revert:

  - v7:
    - "Add more comments for entry changes"
  - v8:
    - "Carried on Thomas' edits on multiple changelogs and comments"
  - v9:
    - "Fixed typos (Randy D.) and massaged a few sentences in the
      documentation"

I'm a bit confused about the surprise here that v12 is different than
the reverted patches. There were multiple rounds of review which
resulted in the code being more than just a revert of the revert along
with a small fix.

This very issue was brought up by Andy in v7 of the series:

And this is what we have here, a series that has more than trivial
differences from the revert, and is more of a pain to review. Look at
what you did with your 25 minutes: you've reverted the revert and went
on to apply fixes on top of it, exactly the thing you've asked
not to do a few months prior.

No need to worry about me sending a new series, as I can't - I just
don't know what you want to see at this point: on one hand you're saying
"we really better start from scratch" and on the other hand "this
conditional irqsave gunk is clearly NOT what was in the tip tree before
it got reverted", you're making suggestions to change comments only to
later complain that "a gazillion of comment changes make reading the
diff harder".
