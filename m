FWIW, Android has indeed been using a similar concept for many years
(the 'prefer-idle' flag you mentioned below) and that proved to be
critical to meet UI requirements on a number of devices. So +1 to have
this use case covered as part of the latency-nice work.

To add a little bit of context here, Android uses cgroups extensively
for task classification. The tasks of any currently used application are
placed in a cgroup based on their 'role'. For instance, all tasks that
belong to the currently visible application are classified as 'top-app',
and are grouped in a cgroup with 'prefer-idle' set (+ other attributes,
e.g. uclamp). The other tasks in the system are usually placed in other
cgroups (e.g. 'background'), with 'prefer-idle' cleared.

When the user switches from one app to the other, their roles are
swapped. At this point userspace needs to move all tasks of an app from
one cgroup to another, to reflect the change in role. But interestingly,
all tasks of the app belong to the same process, so userspace only needs
to write the PID of the parent task to the new cgroup to move all of
them at once. (Note: we're also experimenting having cgroups per-app
rather than per-role, and to change the cgroup parameters instead of
migrating between groups, but that doesn't change the conclusion below).

So, having 'only' a per-task API for latency-nice may not be sufficient
to cover the Android use-case, as that would force userspace to iterate
over all the tasks in an app when switching between roles, and that will
come at a certain cost (currently unknown). However, that will need to
be confirmed experimentally, and starting 'simple' with a per-task API
would definitely be a step in the right direction.

Thanks,
Quentin
