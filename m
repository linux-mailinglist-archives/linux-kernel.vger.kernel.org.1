Thanks for tackling this!

Since this is a processor macro I actually prefer to have parentheses
here. All use sites of ALT_UP_B pass just a label, but still, just to be
on the safe side.

I was wondering why equ has been used in first place. I don't see an
advantage other than having a symbol which can be checked. But given
that this code is stable and don't really need debugging at this point,
I am fine replacing this to make it work for clang.
