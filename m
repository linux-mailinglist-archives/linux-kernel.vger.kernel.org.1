No that is just with James' patchset that enables interrupts for
tpm_tis. It looks like the irq is firing, but the tpm's int_status
register is clear, so the handler immediately returns IRQ_NONE. After
that happens 100000 times the core irq code shuts down the irq, but it
isn't released so I could still see the stats in /proc/interrupts.  With
my attempt below on top of that patchset it releases the irq. I had to
stick the check prior to it checking the int_status register because it
is cleared and the handler returns, and I couldn't do the devm_free_irq
directly in tis_int_handler, so I tried sticking it in tpm_tis_send
where the other odd irq testing code was already located. I'm not sure
if there is another place that would work better for calling the
devm_free_irq.

I was wondering about Windows as well. In addition to the Lenovo systems
which the T490s had Nuvoton tpm, the system I found yesterday was a development
system we have from a partner with an Infineon tpm. Dan Williams has
seen it internally at Intel as well on some system.
