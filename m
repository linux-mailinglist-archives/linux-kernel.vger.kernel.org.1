Hi Peter,
Thanks for the comments.

I tried to keep it simple. You are right, lets make it better.

So for this, I was thinking of making the prctl pass in an integer. And 0
would mean untagged. Does that sound good to you?

I couldn't parse this. Do you mean "enabling coresched does not make sense if
we don't specify whom to share the core with?"

I was just trying to respect the functionality of the CGroup patch in the
coresched series, after all a gentleman named Peter Zijlstra wrote that
patch ;-) ;-).

More seriously, the reason I did it this way is the prctl-tagging is a bit
incompatible with CGroup tagging:

1. What happens if 2 tasks are in a tagged CGroup and one of them changes
their cookie through prctl? Do they still remain in the tagged CGroup but are
now going to not trust each other? Do they get removed from the CGroup? This
is why I made the prctl fail with -EBUSY in such cases.

2. What happens if 2 tagged tasks with different cookies are added to a
tagged CGroup? Do we fail the addition of the tasks to the group, or do we
override their cookie (like I'm doing)?

True, we were relying on the seccomp sandboxing in ChromeOS to protect the
prctl but you're right and I fixed it for next revision.

This is how it is already.

thanks,
