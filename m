We can add code to make a region 'static' or 'one-time' or 'fixed'.

> Regions in Linux is very different than "partitions" we have defined in xmgmt. Regions seem to be a software data structure representing an area on the FPGA that can be reprogrammed. This area is protected by the concept of "bridge" which can be disabled before program and reenabled after it. And you go through region when you need to reprogram this area.

Your central management driver can create / destroy regions at will. It
can keep them in a list, array or tree.

Regions can but don't have to have bridges.

If you need to go through the central driver to reprogram a region,
you can use that to figure out which region to program.

Basically, xmgmt root driver is parent of several partitions who is, in turn, the parent of several subdev drivers. The parent manages the life cycle of its children here.

I don't see how this is conceptually different from what DFL does, and
they managed to use Regions and Bridges.

If things are missing in the framework, please add them instead of
rewriting an entire parallel framework.

You implement your regions callbacks, you can return -EINVAL / -ENOTTY
if you want to fail a reprogramming request to a static partion /
region.

> From what you have explained, it seems that even if I use region / bridge in xmgmt, we can still keep it private to xmgmt instead of exposing the interface to outside world, which we can't support anyway? This means that region will be used as an internal data structure for xmgmt. Since we can't simply replace partition with region, we might as well just use partition throughout the driver, instead of introducing two data structures and use them both in different places.

Think about your partition as an extension to a region that implements
what you need to do for your case of enumerating and reprogramming that
particular piece of your chip.

> However, if using region/bridge can bring in other benefits, please let us know and we could see if we can also add this to xmgmt.

As maintainer I can say it brings the benefit of looking like existing
infrastructure we have. We can add features to the framework as needed
but blanket replacing the entire thing is always a hard sell.

The Kernel userspace ABI is not going to change once it is merged, which
is why we need to get it right. You can change your userspace code long
time after it is merged into the kernel. The otherway round does not
work.

If you're going to do device-tree you'll need device-tree maintainers to
be ok with your bindings.

Btw: Can you fix your line-breaks :)
