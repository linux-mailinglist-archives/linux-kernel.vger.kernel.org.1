To clarify this part AFAIU it, even if we try to prefault the whole
remote area each time kcov_remote_start() is called, then (let alone
the performance impact) the kernel thread can be rescheduled between
kcov_remote_start() and kcov_remote_stop(), and then it might be
running with a different mm than the one that was used when
kcov_remote_start() happened.
