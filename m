Thanks Andrew, you're right. If size == ret, then size -= ret makes
 size = 0 and after that, the loop doesn't change the size.

Ah, I think we need a patch to fix a comment of the function. It says

 * Returns the total length of the key stored in @buf.

But this must be

  * Returns the total bytes of the key which would be written.

As similar to the snprintf(), so that the user can compare the result
with the given buffer size.

Thank you,
