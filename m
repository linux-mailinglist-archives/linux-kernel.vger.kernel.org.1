Hi Matthias,

Thanks for reviewing the patches.

With CTS having no-pull, we are not seeing any power leakages.

"output-high" was present in IDP dts since Bring-up, we've validated on 
the latest code-base and see that "output-high" is not required, will 
remove it.

We have tested by keeping pull-up for TX in sleep state(removed 
output-high) and wakeup is working fine with Bluetooth. Will remove the 
output-high from both default and sleep states.
