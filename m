You can try but you might be chasing ghosts. Please note that this nas-SP
observation was only on zen1 and only for C-class and OMP. The other
machines tested for the same class and OMP were fine (including zen2). Even
D-class on the same machine with OMP was fine as was MPI in both cases. The
bad result indicated that NUMA scanning and faulting was higher but that
is more likely to be a problem with NUMA balancing than your patch.

In the five iterations, two iterations showed a large spike in scan rate
towards the end of an iteration but not the other three. The scan rate
was also not consistently high so there is a degree of luck involved with
SP specifically and there is not a consistently penalty as a result of
your patch.

The only thing to be aware of is that this patch might show up in
bisections once it's merged for both performance gains and losses.
