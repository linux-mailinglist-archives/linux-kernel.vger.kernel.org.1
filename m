Also in the revert commit, please add a comment to tpm_tis.c
about the existing conflict, e.g.

/*
 * Legacy Infineon devices can emit illegit warnings as tpm_tis and
 * tpm_infineon have a conflicting device ID IFX0102.
 */

I'm cool reverting it as long as I get a patch with the required
premises to do so and proper documentation, because the issue is
still real.
