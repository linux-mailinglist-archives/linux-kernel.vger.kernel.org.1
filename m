Hi Catalin, sorry for the late reply, I was on vacation.

Agree. Didn't mean to imply it.

The way I understand it is: "we may have 30 bit DMA limited devices, the re=
st
can deal with 32 bit."

On top of that, I believe it makes little sense to use an offset in the
physical address space below the 32bit mark. You'd be limiting the amount o=
f
memory available to the system. So, if you're going support DMA limited dev=
ices
on your otherwise RAM hungry SoC, you'll have to have that physical address
space directly available, or at least part of it.

All in all, I believe that assuming no 30 bit DMA limited devices exist in =
the
system if the physical addresses don't exist is a fairly safe.

Also note the usage of 'zone_dma_bits' in the DMA code, which assumes that
ZONE_DMA's physical address space is always smaller than (1 << zone_dma_bit=
s) -
1.

=46rom what I've personally grep'd there is no new devices with odd ranges in
sight.

ACPI is being worked on by, among others, Jeremy Linton (one of your collea=
gues
I believe).

We could always use sane defaults for ACPI and be smarter with DT. Yet,
implementing this entails translating nested dma-ranges with the only help =
of
libfdt, which isn't trivial (see devices/of/address.c). IIRC RobH said that=
 it
wasn't worth the effort just for a board.

Nicolas
