Hi Atish,

This all looks reasonable to me, so I think we can merge this once you
can confirm that the runtime services actually work.

Could you explain how you are dealing with the memory map? Are memory
nodes in DT ignored entirely as they should be? What about memory
reservations?

In any case, I will take the first patch as a fix, so it should turn
up in mainline in 1~2 weeks.

Thanks,
Ard.
