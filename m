There are no technical challenges to set the sibling mask to SMT4.
This is for Linux running on PowerVM. When these Power9 boxes are sold /
marketed as X core boxes (where X stand for SMT8 cores).  Since on PowerVM
world, everything is in SMT8 mode, the device tree properties still mark
the system to be running on 8 thread core. There are a number of utilities
like ppc64_cpu that directly read from device-tree. They would get core
count and thread count which is SMT8 based.

If the sibling_mask is set to small core, then same user when looking at
output from lscpu and other utilities that look at sysfs will start seeing
2x number of cores to what he had provisioned and what the utilities from
the device-tree show. This can gets users confused.

So to keep the device-tree properties, utilities depending on device-tree,
sysfs and utilities depending on sysfs on the same page, userspace are only
exposed as SMT8.
