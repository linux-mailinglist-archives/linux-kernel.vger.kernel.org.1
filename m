Practically I don't think it matters in this case as long as we can
distinguish them in the next call (if the user wants to do).
What users want to do (I think) is whether the returned value
(in *hex) is ok to use or not.  By returning -1 on EOF, it might
be confusing for users..

Yes, but it's not conventional IMHO.

I'm ok with the function name and understand your concerns.
And I don't want to insist it strongly but just sharing my thoughts.

Thanks
