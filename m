Hello,

I apologize for the late reply. The proposed interface has been an
ongoing topic and area of experimentation within Facebook as well,
which makes it a bit difficult to respond with certainty here.

I agree with both your usecases. They apply to us as well. We
currently make two small changes to our kernel to solve them. They
work okay-ish in our production environment, but they aren't quite
there yet, and not ready for upstream.

Some thoughts and comments below.

I don't think a userspace implementation is suitable for this purpose.

Kswapd-style background reclaim is beneficial to probably 99% of all
workloads. Because doing reclaim inside the execution stream of the
workload itself is so unnecessary in a multi-CPU environment, whether
the workload is particularly latency sensitive or only cares about
overall throughput. In most cases, spare cores are available to do
this work concurrently, and the buffer memory required between the
workload and the async reclaimer tends to be negligible.

Requiring non-trivial userspace participation for such a basic
optimization does not seem like a good idea to me. We'd probably end
up with four or five hyperscalers having four or five different
implementations, and not much user coverage beyond that.

I floated this patch before:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20200219181219.54356-1-hannes@cmpxchg.org/

It's blocked on infrastructure work in the CPU controller that allows
accounting CPU cycles spent on behalf of other cgroups. But we need
this functionality in other places as well - network, async filesystem
encryption, various other stuff bounced to workers.

This is an important usecase for us as well. And we use it not just to
keep the LRUs warm, but to actively sample the workingset size - the
true amount of memory required, trimmed of all its unused cache and
cold pages that can be read back from disk on demand.

For this purpose, we're essentially using memory.high right now.

The only modification we make here is adding a memory.high.tmp variant
that takes a timeout argument in addition to the limit. This ensures
we don't leave an unsafe limit behind if the userspace daemon crashes.

We have experienced some of the problems you describe below with it.

Agreed on both counts.

This could use some elaboration, I think.

That's a valid argument for proactive reclaim, and I agree with
it. But not necessarily an argument for which part of the proactive
reclaim logic should be in-kernel and which should be in userspace.

That's something we have run into as well. Async memory.high reclaim
helps, but when proactive reclaim does bigger steps and lowers the
limit below the async reclaim buffer, the workload can still enter
direct reclaim. This is undesirable.

Fair enough.

I would generalize that and say that limiting the maximum container
size and driving proactive reclaim are separate jobs, with separate
goals, happening at different layers of the system. Sharing a single
control knob for that can be a coordination nightmare.

Agreed.

This gets the assigning and attribution of targeted reclaim work right
(although it doesn't solve kswapd cycle attribution yet).

However, it also ditches the limit semantics, which themselves aren't
actually a problem. And indeed I would argue have some upsides.

As per above, the kernel knows best when and how much to reclaim to
match the allocation rate, since it's in control of the allocation
path. To do proactive reclaim with the memory.reclaim interface, you
would need to monitor memory consumption closely. Workloads may not
allocate anything for hours, and then suddenly allocate gigabytes
within seconds. A sudden onset of streaming reads through the
filesystem could destroy the workingset measurements, whereas a limit
would catch it and do drop-behind (and thus workingset sampling) at
the exact rate of allocations.

Again I believe something that may be doable as a hyperscale operator,
but likely too fragile to get wider applications beyond that.

My take is that a proactive reclaim feature, whose goal is never to
thrash or punish but to keep the LRUs warm and the workingset trimmed,
would ideally have:

- a pressure or size target specified by userspace but with
  enforcement driven inside the kernel from the allocation path

- the enforcement work NOT be done synchronously by the workload
  (something I'd argue we want for *all* memory limits)

- the enforcement work ACCOUNTED to the cgroup, though, since it's the
  cgroup's memory allocations causing the work (again something I'd
  argue we want in general)

- a delegatable knob that is independent of setting the maximum size
  of a container, as that expresses a different type of policy

- if size target, self-limiting (ha) enforcement on a pressure
  threshold or stop enforcement when the userspace component dies

Thoughts?
