Yeah, I figured we would need something like:

action_result(pfn, MF_MSG_BUDDY_2ND, MF_FAILED) ?
Although checking other parts of the code, MF_IGNORED can suit here as well,
and it is probably better.

I __think__ we do not need the following anymore:

         if (!PageLRU(p) && is_free_buddy_page(p)) {
                 if (flags & MF_COUNT_INCREASED)
                         action_result(pfn, MF_MSG_BUDDY, MF_DELAYED);
                 else
                         action_result(pfn, MF_MSG_BUDDY_2ND, MF_DELAYED);
                 return 0;
         }

We have this block because shake_page() (among other things) sends pcp-pages
back to the buddy freelists, so we could have the chance to handle the page.
Since we will be doing that in get_hwpoison_page, and such scenario should
have been handled in the block from above, I think it is safe to skip that
block.

But I think that the skape_page() has to stay as it flushes pages from pagevecs
to their respective LRU lists, otherwise we could do the wrong thing in:

	if (!PageTransTail(p) && !PageLRU(p))
		goto identify_page_state;

So, I will send V2 with a 5th patch cleaning that up as I do not want to get
it convulated with the fix itself.

thanks Naoya
