Yes, cfs_a. 0xffffa085e48ce000 in Phil's trace.

Yes.

cfs_b, 0xffffa085e48ce000 is the one which is now added in the 2. loop.

Isn't the link between cfs_b and cfs_a the first if condition in
list_add_leaf_cfs_rq():

  if (cfs_rq->tg->parent &&
      cfs_rq->tg->parent->cfs_rq[cpu]->on_list)

to 'connect the branch' or not (default, returning false case)?

Yes.

Yes, but in the example, cfs_a->on_list=1, so we bail out of
list_add_leaf_cfs_rq() early.

I don't grasp how can cfs_a->on_list=1, when cfs_a is throttled and
cfs_b, cfs_c are in a throttled hierarchy?

Maybe this deserves a comment then.
