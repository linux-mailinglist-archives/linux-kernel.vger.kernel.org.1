Thank you for working on this. :) I wonder what SoC bin you tested this on.

I have a patch to print it here:

  https://megous.com/git/linux/commit/?h=ths-5.7&id=c5ddd2a45c7e04dcec31619b58de7c798ad6594c

Feel free to add these OPPs also to OrangePi 3 dts, I've been running mine with
this OPP table for at least a year already (I have the worst SoC bin).

Though I'll run a bit more comprehensive test for more frequencies, like you
did, just to be sure.

One thing I wonder about is if there should not be some small ramp delay on the
CPU regulator node, because voltage change probably takes some small time to
apply, compared to changing the PLL frequency. And I have no idea if the CPU
is not running for some very small time out of spec during transitions.

I didn't find timing information in the PMIC datasheet, but I suppose based
on the DCDCA frequency of 3MHz that it will adapt to the new voltage in the
range of 1s-10s of microseconds.

In datasheet of the similar PMIC (AXP813) there is this note:

  DVM (Dynamic Voltage scaling Management) ramp rate: 2.5mV/us at buck frequency 3MHz

I think it will be simiar with AXP805.

regards,
	o.
