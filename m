Just a note, unit-address implies there is a 'reg' property. Why
that's important below.

Presumably anything current already works. If you had the above
example already, requiring updating the DT to make it work seems fine.

Multiple instances of something implies you have some way to address
them and 'reg' is what defines the address of something. 0,1,2,etc.
looks suspiciously like just some kernel defined indexes, but if
that's how things are defined in the datasheet I'm okay with them.

The one wrinkle is there's only one address space at one level, so
gpio@0, gpio@1, pwm@0, pwm@1, etc. doesn't really work (well, it
works, but having overlapping addresses is not good practice). Either
we relax that in this case or we can add another level to group nodes.

Just to pick on ab8500, it should have had 'reg' property IMO. The
'bank' is clearly a h/w property and how you address each sub-device.

I don't think we should use order.

Yes, we should use 'reg' whenever possible. If we don't have 'reg',
then you shouldn't have a unit-address either and you can simply match
on the node name (standard DT driver matching is with compatible,
device_type, and node name (w/o unit-address)). We've generally been
doing 'classname-N' when there's no 'reg' to do 'classname@N'.
Matching on 'classname-N' would work with node name matching as only
unit-addresses are stripped.
