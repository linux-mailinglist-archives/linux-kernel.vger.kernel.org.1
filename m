SARA looks interesting. What is missing is a prctl() to enable all W^X 
protections irrevocably for the current process, then systemd could 
enable it for services with MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes.

I didn't also see specific measures against memfd_create() or file 
system W&X, but perhaps those can be added later. Maybe pkey_mprotect() 
is not handled either unless it uses the same LSM hook as mprotect().

Not in general, but I think it can work well in context of system 
services. Then you can ensure that for a specific service, 
memfd_create() is blocked by seccomp and the file systems are W^X 
because of mount namespaces etc., so there should not be any means to 
construct arbitrary executable pages.
