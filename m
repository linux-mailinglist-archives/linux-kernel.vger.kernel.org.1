Could you please give some more details. Is there any particular problem
which might be caused by this new READ_ONCE() here, that you you are
concerned about. READ_ONCE() is already getting used in multiple places
in core MM which can not be configured out (like mm/gup.c). It is getting
used in core HugeTLB (mm/hugetlb.c) as well. AFAICS, there is no standard
for using READ_ONCE() while walking page tables entries. We have examples
in core MM for both ways.

AFAICS, __HAVE_ARCH_HUGE_PTEP_GET should be used on a platform only when
a HugeTLB entry could not constructed by dereferencing a page table entry
as in the case with ARM (32 bit). Using READ_ONCE() while dereferencing is
really not a special case that will need __HAVE_ARCH_HUGE_PTEP_GET. Moving
READ_ONCE() into generic definition solves the problem while also taking
care of a known problem on arm64. IMHO, it seems like the right thing to
do unless there is another problem that pops up some where else because of
READ_ONCE().
