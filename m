Yes, I was thinking of only doing it if we didn't come through the
pe_entry. We could also avoid re-parsing the command line if we add a
global flag to indicate that.

Regarding the memory footprint, if there's no initrd that might be a
problem, since in that case ImageSize will only cover the actual data
from the bzImage, so it would be safer to move them to data (including
sys_table).

We could just pull the stub's bss section all into data with objcopy
similar to what ARM64 does [1]? i.e. rename .bss to .bss.efistub and
then pull that into .data in the linker script for the compressed
kernel?

There is also this scary looking comment in gnu-efi's linker script:
	/* the EFI loader doesn't seem to like a .bss section, so we stick
	   it all into .data: */
I don't know what the history of that is.

[1] As an aside, why doesn't ARM do this as well rather than using the
section(.data) annotation?
