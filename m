The point about doing the assignment with the declaration certainly makes
the "ugliness" worse, I agree. I'm still not generally convinced about
the redundancy level pros/cons, but I concede that having a common idiom
(rather than a succinct but subsystem-dependent idiom) is better for
people reading the code for the first time.

And this observation about workflow does strike a chord with me. I do end
up with those kind of searches too. In trying to examine my preferences
here, I think my instincts are to avoid open-coded types (leading me to
want to use typeof()) but I think those instincts were actually developed
from dealing with _sizeof_ and all the way it goes terribly wrong. So,
okay, I'm convinced. container_of() it is.

Doing these conversions becomes a little less mechanical if assignment
needs to be split from declaration, but hey, we've got a 100 character
line "limit" now, so maybe it'll be less needed. :)
