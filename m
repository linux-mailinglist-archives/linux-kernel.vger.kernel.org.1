So the mhi_intvec_threaded_handler() (BHI) MSI that fires to switch the 
EE
to RDDM may come much later than the SYS_ERROR state change event from 
the
control event ring. We currently, do not move to MHI_PM_SYS_ERR_DETECT
state if RDDM is supported i.e. mhi_cntrl->rddm_image is set. However, 
it
means that we will remain in an "active" MHI PM state for the duration 
of
time until RDDM EE (BHI) MSI comes in. We have seen it take 5 seconds in
some bad cases.

Yes, the point is to only remove the mhi_cntrl->rddm_image check but 
still
retain the "has EE moved to become RDDM" check. This allows us to avoid 
any
extra processing of moving states to MHI_PM_SYS_ERR_DETECT state if it 
may
be unnecessary (EE already changed to RDDM). The mhi_cntrl->rddm_image 
is
also present in mhi_pm_sys_err_handler(mhi_cntrl) function so it is not
needed here.

This is why I mention the word RDDM "capability". If controller supports 
RDDM
is not enough to skip the move to MHI_PM_SYS_ERR_DETECT state as it is 
safer
to move and stop client drivers from pushing data.

Thanks,
