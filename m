Completed, no, but I think it does enforce that they're visible to other
CPUs before this write is visible to other CPUs.

I'll quote relevant bits from the document ...

 (2) Data dependency barriers.

     A data dependency barrier is a weaker form of read barrier.  In the case
     where two loads are performed such that the second depends on the result
     of the first (eg: the first load retrieves the address to which the second
     load will be directed), a data dependency barrier would be required to
     make sure that the target of the second load is updated after the address
     obtained by the first load is accessed.

I don't think I explained myself well enough.

When we initialise devmem_inode, does devmem_inode->i_mapping->host point
to somewhere other than devmem_inode?

I appreciate in this function, inode->i_mapping->host will point to inode.
But we're now changing i_mapping to be devmem_inode's i_mapping.  Why
do we need to change devmem_inode's i_mapping->host pointer?
