I should have Cc-ed you on this V4 patch, sorry about that.

I have followed that (i.e patch on mmotm/next as fix) only when the
required change is smaller as compared to the series on mmotm/next.
But for others a new patch should be better which can be replaced
on mmotm and next. At least that is my understanding and would like
to be corrected otherwise.

That should not have happened, all new THP migration events are with
CONFIG_MIGRATION rather than CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE previously.
