Will do in the next version.

For the uswapd use-case, I am not concerned about the external memory
pressure source but the application hitting its own memory.high limit
and getting throttled.

The main aim for the proactive reclaim is to not cause an external
memory pressure. The low events can be another source of information
to tell the system level situation to the 'Memory Overcommit
Controller'. So, I see the low events as complementary, not the
replacement for the reclaim interface.

BTW by "low events from external memory pressure" am I correct in
understanding that you meant an unrelated job reclaiming and
triggering low events on a job of interest. Or do you mean to
partition a job into sub-jobs and then use the low events between
these sub-jobs somehow?
