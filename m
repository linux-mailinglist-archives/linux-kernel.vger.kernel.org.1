Is it correct to assume the stuff checked differs from test to test
and done in user-space.

Is it correct to assume the stuff checked differs from test to test
and done in user-space.

Is it correct to assume undoing evil differs from test to test
and done in user-space, provide it can be done from userspace.

The overall plan sounds good to me. I am all for adding support to
selftests so we can keep extending it.
