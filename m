Good question!

This is similar to the situation in panic() when other CPUs are
stopped. It is more safe when the CPUs are stopped using IRQ.
There is higher danger of a deadlock when NMI is used.

bust_spinlock() is used in panic() to increase the chance to go over
the deadlock and actually see the messages. It is not enough when
more locks are used by the console (VT/TTY is good example). And
it is not guaranteed that the console will still work after
the hack is disabled by bust_spinlocks(0).

There is definitely a risk of deadlock when console drivers are called
by KDB. There are plans to create some lockless console drivers to
handle panic(). It might be usable in KDB as well.

The question is what are the expectations of KDB users. How often does
it happen that KDB does not work or that the system does not longer
work when continue is called in KDB?

Makes sense.

Good point. I would say that this patch will not make the situation
worse. The code is called when KDB already uses consoles. It is just
a trick how to use existing code to print even more messages in
KDB context.

What about?

"KDB has to get messages on consoles even when the system is stopped.
It uses kdb_printf() internally and calls console drivers on its own.

It uses a hack to reuse an existing code. It sets "kdb_trap_printk"
global variable to redirect even the normal printk() into the
kdb_printf() variant.

The variable "kdb_trap_printk" is checked in printk_default() and
it is ignored when printk is redirected to printk_safe in NMI context.
Solve this by moving the check into printk_func().

It is obvious that it is not fully safe. But it does not make things
worse. The console drivers are already called in this context by
kdb_printf() direct calls."

This is fair :-)
