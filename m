Would you have any examples? Because I find this highly unlikely.
OVERCOMMIT_NEVER only works when virtual memory is not largerly
overcommited wrt to real memory demand. And that tends to be more of
an exception rather than a rule. "Modern" userspace (whatever that
means) tends to be really hungry with virtual memory which is only used
very sparsely.

I would argue that either somebody is running an "OVERCOMMIT_NEVER"
friendly SW and this is a permanent setting or this is not used at all.
At least this is my experience.

So I strongly suspect that LTP test failure is not something we should
really lose sleep over. It would be nice to find a way to flush existing
batches but I would rather see a real workload that would suffer from
this imprecision.

On the other hand perf. boost with larger batches with defualt overcommit
setting sounds like a nice improvement to have.
