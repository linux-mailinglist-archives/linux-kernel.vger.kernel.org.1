TBH, This is total confusion!!!

when to use "*-names" Device tree bindings is totally depended on Linux 
Subsystem interfaces!

And what is the starting point to draw this line?

In previous NON-DT life clk_get api name argument comes from the clk 
names that clk provider registered the clocks with.

If I remember this correctly, the name that is refereed here for 
clk_get() is old clkdev api based on clk_lookups and is not the same as 
clk-names that we have in Device tree. Atleast in this case!

clk-names has two objectives in DT:
1> To find the index of the clock in the clocks DT property.

2> If actual clk name is specified then if "1" fails then name could 
potentially fallback to use old clkdev based clk_lookups.

In this specific case we have "sec" as clock-names which is totally used 
for indexing into clocks property and it can not be used for (2) as 
there is no clk named "sec" registered by any of the clk providers.

So this does not justify the reasoning why "clock-names" should be used 
while "reg-names" should not be used!. Both of them are going to be 
finally used for indexing into there respective properties.

This also brings in greater confusion for both existing and while adding 
bindings with "*-names" for new interfaces.

Rob, can you please provide some clarity and direction on when to 
use/not-use *-names properties!
