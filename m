Are you thinking about scheduling both RT and non-RT tasks through
deadline servers? If yes, then I think that using something like
laxity-based scheduling for the SCHED_OTHER server can be a good idea
(but then we need to understand how to combine deadline-based
scheduling with laxity-based scheduling, etc...)

Or are you thinking about keeping the SCHED_OTHER server throttled
until its laxity is 0 (or until its laxity is lower than some small
value)? In this second case, the approach would work even if RT tasks
are not scheduled through a server (but I do not know which kind of
performance guarantee we could provide).

Yes, this could be a good optimization.
