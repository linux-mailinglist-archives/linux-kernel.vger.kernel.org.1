OK, this is an important detail. So the context which is doing the work
doesn't belong to the target memcg? If that is the case then I do
understand why you consider it a problem. In general I would recommend
running operations like this one in scope of the affected cgroup. But
maybe that is not really an option in your setup.

Anyway this is an important information to have in the changelog.

Well, I was basing my feedback on the available information in the
changelog. It is quite clear that somebody has to pay for the work.
Moving as much of the work to the writer makes sense as long as the
context is runing in the same cgroup so the work gets accounted
properly. If this assumption doesn't match the reality then we have to
re-evaluate our priorities here.

This should be something quite easy to double check right?

Reverting 536d3bf261a2 ("mm: memcontrol: avoid workload stalls when
lowering memory.high") would certainly help to throttle producers but it
still doesn't solve the underlying problem that a lot of work could be
done in a context which lives outside of the memcg, right? The effect
would be much smaller and it shouldn't be effectivelly unbounded but
still something we should think about.

That being said going with the revert sounds like a slightly better
approach to me.
