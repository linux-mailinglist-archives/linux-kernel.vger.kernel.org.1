There is no THP migration events to track unless it is enabled. Why to
show these statistics (as 0) when its not even possible. If the config
simplicity is the only intended rationale here, it might not be the
case either. These events and their tracking would still need to be
wrapped with CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE otherwise.

If your concern is more towards CONFIG_ARCH_ENABLE_THP_MIGRATION being
unsuitable or with complex dependencies, then that is something how THP
migration feature itself is implemented currently and adding VM events
does not address that. A possible patch in the future patch could solve
all these (together).

But sure, let's hear it for what others have to say on this.

Makes sense but IMHO we should keep _pmd_ to be more specific.
Will change the name here as thp_pmd_migration_success().

We will have to protect these with CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE as
the events are still conditionally available.

AFAIK, we have examples both ways but will change if this is preferred.
