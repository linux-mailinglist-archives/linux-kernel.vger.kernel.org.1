Yeah I think that works. I tried understanding gup.c code a bit more,
and it looks like FOLL_LONGTERM only works for the pup_fast variant
right now? All others seem to have this comment that it's somehow
incompatible with FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY and daxfs. But grepping
around for that didn't show up anything, at least not nearby dax code.
For my understanding of all this, what's the hiccup there?

For plans, I only started this for a bit of my own learning, but I
think I'll respin with the following changes:
- convert exynos and habanalabs to pin_user_pages_fast directly,
instead of going through this frame-vector detour
- move the locking and convert get_vaddr_frames to pup_fast as Jason suggested
- hack up some truly gross rfc to plug the follow_pfn hole

Cheers, Daniel
