Yes, the race is very rare and the window itself should be relatively
small. This doesn't really answer the question about blocking though.

And it is a very theoretical one, right? Can you even trigger it? What
would happen if the race is lost? Is it serious? This all would be part
of the changelog ideally. This is a tricky area that spans hugetlb,
memory hotplug and hwpoisoning. All of them tricky.
