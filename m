This is for kgdboc or one of the other IO modules?  I do know that, at
least for kgdboc, we have the "config_mutex".  I won't promise that
there are no bugs there but in the very least it should mostly prevent
a host of these types of issues.  ...so I guess you'd have to in
parallel be spamming a register of a non kgdboc IO module together
with an unregister of kgdboc?

Yeah, still wouldn't hurt to try to figure out how to make it cleaner.  :-)
