In that case, this patch mandates that the firmware region has to be
mark "reserved"
the device tree so that the Linux kernel doesn't try to allocate
memory from there.
OpenSBI is already doing it from v0.7. Thus, any user using latest
OpenSBI can leverage
this patch for a better TLB utilization.
However, legacy previous boot stages(BBL) do not reserve this area via
DT which may
result in an unexpected crash. I am not sure how many developers still
use BBL though.

Few general suggestions to tackle this problem:
1. This mandatory requirement should be added to the booting document
so that any other
SBI implementation is also aware of it.
2. You may have to move the patch1 to a separate config so that any
users of legacy boot stages
can disable this feature.
