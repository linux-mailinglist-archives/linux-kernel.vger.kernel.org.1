while I have predominantly tested on ppc, I did test on X86 with CONFIG_NUMA
enabled/disabled on both single node and multi node machines.
However, I dont have a cpuless/memoryless x86 system.

1. On a machine with just one node with node number not being 0,
the current setup will end up showing 2 online nodes. And when there are
more than one online nodes, numa_balancing gets enabled.

Without patch
$ grep numa /proc/vmstat
numa_hit 95179
numa_miss 0
numa_foreign 0
numa_interleave 3764
numa_local 95179
numa_other 0
numa_pte_updates 1206973                 <----------
numa_huge_pte_updates 4654                 <----------
numa_hint_faults 19560                 <----------
numa_hint_faults_local 19560                 <----------
numa_pages_migrated 0


With patch
$ grep numa /proc/vmstat 
numa_hit 322338756
numa_miss 0
numa_foreign 0
numa_interleave 3790
numa_local 322338756
numa_other 0
numa_pte_updates 0                 <----------
numa_huge_pte_updates 0                 <----------
numa_hint_faults 0                 <----------
numa_hint_faults_local 0                 <----------
numa_pages_migrated 0

So we have a redundant page hinting numa faults which we can avoid.

2. Few people have complained about existence of this dummy node when
parsing lscpu and numactl o/p. They somehow start to think that the tools
are reporting incorrectly or the kernel is not able to recognize resources
connected to the node.
