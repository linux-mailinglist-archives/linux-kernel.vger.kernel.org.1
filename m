kfree_rcu() as of today is just a conveniance wrapper around
call_rcu(obj, rcu) which can be called from any context and it still
takes TWO arguments.

Icepack?

So if you come up with a new kfree_rcu_magic(void *obj) single argument
variant which can only be called from sleepable contexts then this does
not require any of the raw lock vs. non raw hacks at all because you can
simply allocate without holding the raw lock in the rare case that you
run out of storage space. With four 4k pages preallocated per CPU that's
every 2048 invocations per CPU on 64bit.

So if you run into that situation then you drop the lock and then it's
racy because you might be preempted or migrated after dropping the lock
and you might have done a useless allocation, but that does not justify
having a special allocator just for that? You have an extra page, so
what?

To prevent subsequent callers to add to the allocation race you simply
can let them wait on the first allocating attempt to finish That avoids
more pointless allocations and as a side effect prevents all of them to
create more pressure by continuing their open/close loop naturally
without extra work.

No. It dropped the rcu internal lock and does a regular GFP_KENRNEL
allocation which waits for the page to become available. Which is a good
thing in the open/close scenario because it throttles the offender.

Don't even think about optimizing your new thing for #2. It's a
pointless exercise. If the task which runs into the 'can't allocate'
case then is sleeps and waits. End of story.

If this atomic context corner case is hit within a problematic context
then we talk about the RCU of today and not about the future single
argument thing. And that oldschool RCU has a fallback. We are talking
about pressure corner cases and you really want to squeeze out the last
cache miss?  What for? If there is pressure then these cache misses are
irrelevant.
