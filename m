How can you create a patch to prevent a bug that is not present?

But no, this is not true, look at all of the kernel hardening features
added to the kernel over the past 5+ years.  Those are specifically to
help handle the problem when there are bugs in the kernel, so that "bad
things" do not happen when they occur.

We are human, no development process can prevent this.

I think 2. is wrong, so it's not a risk.

And how is 1. a "risk"?

And of course, 3., humans, well, what can you do about them?  :)

How do you "raise awareness" among a developer community that is 4000
people each year (1000 are new each year), consisting of 450+ different
companies?

And yes, we have lots of tools, and run them all the time on all of our
public trees constantly.  And they fix things before they get merged and
sent out to the rest of the world.

So what specific things are you wanting to discuss here?

thanks,
