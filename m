That may be your desire, but that is impossible without knowing that
(a) it has the clocks
(b) what those clocks are connected to

I guess we could "make something up" but as DT is supposed to describe
hardware, I don't see how we can satisfy that and your requirement.

The only thing that is known from the documentation is that there is
one clock for the GPU on Dove.
