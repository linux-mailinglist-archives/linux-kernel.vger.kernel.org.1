Agreed.

The smaller systems should not be required to waste those memory in
a default case, unless there is a real and available larger system
with those increased nodes.

We will have to test that. Besides 256 (2 ^ 8) is the first threshold
to be crossed here.

Agreed. Do we really need to match X86 right now ? Do we really have
systems that has 64 nodes ? We should not increase the default node
value and then try to solve some new problems, when there might not
be any system which could even use that. I would suggest increase
NODES_SHIFT value upto as required by a real and available system.
