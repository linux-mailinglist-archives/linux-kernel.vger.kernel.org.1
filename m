DSI wasn't working on the first patch set that Maxime sent - I haven't
tested this one as yet but will do so.
DPI was working early on to both an Adafruit 800x480 DPI panel, and
via a VGA666 as VGA.
HDMI is obviously working.
VEC is being ignored now. The clock structure is more restricted than
earlier chips, so to get the required clocks for the VEC without using
fractional divides it compromises the clock that other parts of the
system can run at (IIRC including the ARM). That's why the VEC has to
be explicitly enabled for the firmware to enable it as the only
output. It's annoying, but that's just a restriction of the chip.
