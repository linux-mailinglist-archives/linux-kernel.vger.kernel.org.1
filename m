Subject: [RFC PATCH v2 00/13] perf pmu-events: Support event aliasing for system PMUs

Currently event aliasing for only CPU and uncore PMUs is supported. In
fact, only uncore PMUs aliasing is supported for when the uncore PMUs are
fixed for a CPU, which may not always be the case for certain
architectures.

This series adds support for PMU event aliasing for system and other
uncore PMUs which are not tied to a specific CPU. Or, more specifically,
CPUs which not tied to those PMUs.

For this, we introduce system event tables in generated pmu-events.c,
which contain a per-SoC table of events of all its system PMUs. Each
per-PMU event is matched by a "COMPAT" property.

When creating aliases for PMUs, we treat core/uncore* and system PMUs
differently:

- For CPU PMU, we always match for the event mapfile based on the CPUID.
   This has not changed.

- For an uncore or system PMU, we iterate through all the events in all
   the system PMU tables.

   Matches are based on the "COMPAT" property matching the PMU sysfs
   identifier contents, in /sys/bus/event_source/devices/<PMU>/identifier

* uncore PMUs may also be matched by system PMUs event support.

Initial reference support is also added for ARM SMMUv3 PMCG (Performance
Monitor Event Group) PMU for HiSilicon hip08 platform with only a single
event so far - see driver in drivers/perf/arm_smmuv3_pmu.c for that driver.

Here is a sample output with this series on Huawei D06CS board:

Support is also added for imx8mm DDR PMU.

Series is here:
https://github.com/hisilicon/kernel-dev/commits/private-topic-perf-5.6-sys-pmu-events-v2-upstream

Differences to v1:
- Stop using SoC id and use a per-PMU identifier instead
- Add metric group sys events support
   - This is a bit hacky
- Add imx8mm DDR Perf support
- Add fix for parse events sel
	- without it, I get this spewed for metric event:

	assertion failed at util/parse-events.c:1637

Patches still need to be sent to support per-PMU identifer sysfs file
in the kernel.

Thanks,
John
