That just bypasses an allocation for the array, to make it more simple
and move forward toward the path we would like to test. Also head is
set to NULL to simulated headless freeing.

Of course to have real tests would be good.

I see at it like, headless variant has to be called from the sleeping context, 
therefore it can sleep. What is better to call synchronize_rcu() or doing direct
reclaim depends on how many CPUs in a system we have. I suspect that doing
direct reclaim is better, at least it will free some memory for us. We
could also extend that patch and make it a bit different, for example do
NOWAIT then try ATOMIC and as a last step do GFP_KERNEL alloc.
