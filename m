Just as a clarification here, we should not be even talking about
signal routing here. We are talking about functions that an external
components perform from the connector's perspective. It depends on the
platform does that function require changing the routing of the lines
from the connector. For example, data role swapping does not require
muxing on platforms that have single dual-role USB controller, but
platforms that have separate IPs for the USB host and USB device
controllers will need a mux.

Note, that it is even possible that switching from USB to DisplayPort
mode does not require any pin reconfiguration from the mux, even if
the platform has one, because the PHY can be shared between USB3 and
DP. Then the PHY just needs to be told that it is now in DP mode when
DP alt mode is entered instead of the mux.

I just realized that you have in practice placed the mux-agent into
the graph below, right? That we can not do, because it is not
physically connected to the connector.
