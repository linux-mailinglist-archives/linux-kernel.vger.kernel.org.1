Esteem Complement,    Tuesday October 6th 2020

Hello, my name is Steve Odonkon, Audit Accounting Officer of Standard Chartered Bank, Basinghall Ave, London, United Kingdom. I got your information when I was searching for an oversea partner among other names, I ask for your pardon if my approach is offensive as I never meant to invade your privacy through this means, and also i believe this is the best and secured means I can pass my message across to you in clear terms. I have sent you this proposal before now; I do hope this will get to you in good health.


As the Audit Accounting Officer of the bank, I have access to lots of documents because I handle some of the bank's sensitive files. On the course of the last year 2019 business report, I discovered that my branch in which I am the Audit Accounting Officer made (£5,720,000.00). Million British pounds from some past government contractors in which my head office are not aware of and will never be aware of. I have placed this funds on what we call escrow call account with no beneficiary.


As an officer of this bank I cannot be directly connected to this money, so my aim of contacting you is to assist me receive this money in your bank account and get 40% of the total funds as commission. There are practically no risks involved, it will be a bank-to-bank transfer, and all I need from you is to stand claim as the Original depositor of these funds who made the deposit with my branch so that my head office can order the transfer to your designated bank account.

Send me your contact details below to enable me furnish you with more relevant details that will help you understand the transaction.
