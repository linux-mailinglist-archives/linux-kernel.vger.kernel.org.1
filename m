No need to apologize. That's my bad. 

Maybe some context is useful.
One of the reasons why we tend to sometimes not take changes such as
this even though they would be covered by our officially documented
coding style is to keep the churn minimal.
Whenever functional change happens in codepaths such as this the risk of
regressions is quite high. That's partially because we could use more
tests to catch them (And if you're interested in stuff like this then
writing selftests is always great. We can always use more of them.) but
also simply because the code is complex. Having a lot of non-functional
commits that don't really improve the legibility of the code
significantly can become an issue for maintainers. Personally, I tend to
be less worried about this but this is a collaborative endeavour. :)

Thanks!
Christian
