I'm guessing it still works fine today by doing a deferred probe and
you are just trying to avoid having to do a deferred probe? I haven't
kept track of RPi4's upstream support status.

Which PCI driver is that specifically (I'm sure I can dig around to
find RPi4's DT and figure it out, but it's easier to just ask :) ) ?
Also, can you point me to the DT and the nodes that we are talking
about here (the PCI and the firmware nodes)?

Ha, this was my initial idea for the whole fw_devlink feature. I
called it depends-on. Rob/Frank convinced me to instead just parse the
existing bindings -- which was definitely the right call. Otherwise DT
would have been a mess. Adding support for "depends-on" for one off
use cases might still be a touchy topic. I myself am on the wall. It's
useful for some rare cases, but it's also very easy to abuse.

I did think about this option too sometime back, but not too keen on
that -- at least at this point. Mostly because there are other issues
I want to resolve first and want to get their design right before
getting to hand off property parsing to other drivers/files.

I'll let you know if I do. I'm not sure I fully understand the issue
though. I don't think you are trying to avoid deferred probes because
you aren't trying to improve boot time. I'm guessing the PCI bus
driver in question has no way to know when to defer the probe, in this
case you are trying to fix?
