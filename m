Yes, that is what I would expect.

Most of this code is already there as part of the generic card
infrastructure, the only thing that stands out for me is the GPIO to
switch between the front and rear mics.

It shouldn't be hugely difficult to split the DT files up usually, and
ideally they'd be small enough that just having an entirely new sound
bit isn't the end of the world.  Again I'm just not clear what you're
seeing here.

Potentially, or there might be so little shared that it's just a
separate machine driver.

Yes.

To an extent this depends on how different the CODECs and general setup
are but a different CODEC is something that often justifies a separate
compatible.  Of course you also have an awful lot of systems that work
with the generic card drivers and all different kinds of CPU and CODEC,
usually because the driver doesn't need to know anything about the
implementation of either.
