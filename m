If I got this one right:

  39a06b67c2c1 ("irqchip/gic: Ensure we have an ISB between ack and ->handle_irq")

you're describing case 2, which is indeed gone on gic-v3. However IIUC we
also want an ISB between poking IAR and calling into the irqaction (case 1)
- we get just that with IPIs due to the early gic_eoi_irq(), but we don't
for the other flows.
