Thank you for kindly explaining your concenrs in detail.  However, I think it's
ok to do this check even without '--strict' for files if we explicitly says
it's suggestion only, as Michal said.  My patch does so.

Sorry, I don't understand your point here.  Why do you think it's not helpful?
If 'checkpatch' finds the deprecated terms, it will ask people to read this
file, which explains special rules for each of the deprecations if exists.  The
rule is, in the case of 'slave', 'applies to new uses only'.  Therefore, people
could stop sending the noisy unnecessary patches to the maintainers.


Thanks,
