Is this a test between two machines? What is the device driver of the
machine receiving and printing the packet? It would be helpful to know
whether this uses CHECKSUM_COMPLETE or CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY.

That's not exactly what I said. It looks to me that a device that sets
CHECKSUM_COMPLETE will return TP_STATUS_CSUM_VALID from
__netif_receive_skb_core even if the TCP checksum turns out to be bad.
If a driver would insert such packets into the stack, that is.

The latter. All these checksums are about transport layer checksums
(the ip header checksum is cheap to compute). Multiple checksums
refers to packets encapsulated in other protocols with checksum, such
as GRE or UDP based like Geneve.
