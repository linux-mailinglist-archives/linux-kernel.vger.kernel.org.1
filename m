Ahh, right. Will fix it.

AFICS the _SHIFT defines for a given register must be placed sequentially
with dummy place holders (4 bit wide) for any missing fields. In that case
we could just call BUILD_BUG_ON() for any possible breakage or overlap. But
wondering how and where to loop over these SHIFT values for these registers.

Another way (not build time though) will be to scan through ftr_id_xxx[],
fetch individual arm64_ftr_bits (assuming there are dummy entries for non
existing fields) and assert that arm6r_ftr_bits[shift, width] validates
against the previous arm6r_ftr_bits[shift, width] in an increasing manner.

Either of these methods will require some more thoughts.

Except for ftr_single32[], all other arm64_ftr_bits entries have the exact
same shift value (i.e 4). ARM64_FTR_WIDTH sounds good ?
