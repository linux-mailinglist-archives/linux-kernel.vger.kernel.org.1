By looking at local64 headers, it appears that 32-bit rely on atomic64,
which on x86 is implemented with LOCK; cmpxchg8b for 586+ (which is AFAIK
painfully slow) and with cli/sti for 386/486 (which is not nmi-safe).

For all other 32-bit architectures, the generic atomic64.h implements 64-bit
atomics using spinlocks with irqs off, which seems to also bring considerable
overhead, in addition to be non-reentrant with respect to NMI-like interrupts,
e.g. FIQ on ARM32.

That seems at odds with the performance constraints of ftrace's ring buffer.

Those performance and reentrancy concerns are why I always stick to local_t
(long), and never use a full 64-bit type for anything that has to
do with concurrent store/load between execution contexts in lttng.

This would be interesting to see, because if xadd and cmpxchg have
similar overhead, then going for a cmpxchg-loop for the space
reservation could vastly decrease the overall complexity of this
timestamp+space reservation algorithm.

If we decrease complexity of the fast-paths, we can then reduce the
amount of test+branches which need to be performed and instruction cache
being used, and this can lead to performance improvements. So it's not only
good in making things more easily verifiable, but it also improves
performance.

Good. Simple is good. :-)

OK,
