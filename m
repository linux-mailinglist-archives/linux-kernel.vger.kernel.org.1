So I guess in the one-clock case it's more optional and if you feel
strongly I'll get rid of clk-names here.  ...but if we ever need
another clock we probably will want to add it back and (I could be
corrected) I believe it's convention to specify clk-names even with
one clock.

I won't say it's impossible to get by without clock-names when you
have more than one clock, but (almost) nobody does it.  It's hard to
quickly come up with a good way to search for this, but skimming
through:

git grep -C5 'clocks.*,' -- arch/arm64/boot/dts

...you don't find too many examples of no clock-names and you find
_lots_ of examples where clock-names are specified.  One example that
_does_ have multiple clocks and doesn't specify clock-names is
"simple-framebuffer".  Looking at the Linux driver you can see they
have to use the special "of_clk_get()" variant to handle it.
