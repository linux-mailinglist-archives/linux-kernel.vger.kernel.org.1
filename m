Seems a clever idea and was something I wanted as well. Thanks. Some comments

I might not have fully understand the code but I get the basic idea it is
aiming for. Basically you want to align the cases where the address space is
free from both sides so that you can trigger the PMD-moving optimization.

Regarding the ADDR_AFTER_NEXT checks, shouldn't you check for:

	if (ADDR_AFTER_NEXT(ALIGN(*old_addr + *len, PMD_SIZE), old))
		return;

and for the len calculation, I did not follow what you did, but I think you
meant something like this? Does the following reduce to what you did? At
least this is a bit more readable I think:

	*len += (ALIGN(*new_addr + *len, PMD_SIZE) - (*new_addr + *len));

	which reduces to:

	*len = ALIGN(*new_addr + *len, PMD_SIZE) - *new_addr;

Also you did "len +=", it should be "*len +=" in this function.

In try_to_align_start(), everything looks correct to me.

Oh ok, we had some requirements in my old job about moving large address
spaces which were aligned so it triggered a lot in those. Also folks in the
ChromeOS team tell me it is helping them.

Yes, I had a simple mremap() test which was moving a 1GB map and measuring
performance. Once I get a chance I can try it out with this optimization and
trigger it with unaligned addresses as well.

thanks,
