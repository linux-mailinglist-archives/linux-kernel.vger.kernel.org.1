This turned out to be a clock/pm issue. To confirm, I just marked clk as 
critical
so that it won't be gated and I saw the replicator1(swao_replicator) 
registers
intact after probe. Also alternatively, I tried to comment out disabling 
pclk
to check if there is something wrong in amba pm and this keeps the 
registers
intact as well.

Thanks,
