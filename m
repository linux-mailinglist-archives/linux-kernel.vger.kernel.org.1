An individual driver should NOT be creating a class, that is not what it
is there for.

Class names are very "rare" and should not be dynamically created at
all.

No it is not appropriate at all to do that.

So, I'll ignore this patch as this is not something that you all should
do.  If an in-kernel user needs this, I will be glad to revisit this
issue, so I strongly suggest you work to get your code merged upstream
properly, so we can review it and suggest what you should be doing
instead.

thanks,
