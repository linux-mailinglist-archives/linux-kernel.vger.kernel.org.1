Please post a patch adding the address as 2nd parameter. Cc Peng Fan from
NXP who is the original author of the file. I was also wondering why have
I not added the address when I extended support for multiple channel/shmem
with smc/hvc. One key point here is that firmware *must not* return
INVALID PARAMETER and *must* ignore it.

May be we can add a note while adding that the firmware can ignore that
parameter if it supports only one channel && hardcoded in the firmware.
It needs to be PA as obtained from the DT. Since it is custom SIP id, it
needs to be well documented.
