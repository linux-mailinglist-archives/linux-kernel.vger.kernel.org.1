This change updates KASAN documentation to reflect the addition of boot
parameters and also reworks and clarifies some of the existing sections,
in particular: defines what a memory granule is, mentions quarantine,
makes Kunit section more readable.

+Boot parameters
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Hardware tag-based KASAN mode (see the section about different mode below) is
+intended for use in production as a security mitigation. Therefore it supports
+boot parameters that allow to disable KASAN competely or otherwise control
+particular KASAN features.
+
+The things that can be controlled are:
+
+1. Whether KASAN is enabled at all.
+2. Whether KASAN collects and saves alloc/free stacks.
+3. Whether KASAN panics on a detected bug or not.
+
+The ``kasam.mode`` boot parameter allows to choose one of three main modes:
+
+- ``kasan.mode=off`` - KASAN is disabled, no tag checks are performed
+- ``kasan.mode=prod`` - only essential production features are enabled
+- ``kasan.mode=full`` - all KASAN features are enabled
+
+The chosen mode provides default control values for the features mentioned
+above. However it's also possible to override the default values by providing:
+
+- ``kasan.stacktrace=off`` or ``=on`` - enable alloc/free stack collection
+                                        (default: ``on`` for ``mode=full``,
+                                         otherwise ``off``)
+- ``kasan.fault=report`` or ``=panic`` - only print KASAN report or also panic
+			                 (default: ``report``)
+
+If ``kasan.mode parameter`` is not provided, it defaults to ``full`` when
+``CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL`` is enabled, and to ``prod`` otherwise.
+
+For developers
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Software KASAN modes use compiler instrumentation to insert validity checks.
+Such instrumentation might be incompatible with some part of the kernel, and
+therefore needs to be disabled. To disable instrumentation for specific files
+or directories, add a line similar to the following to the respective kernel
+Makefile:
+

+
+    KASAN_SANITIZE_main.o := n
