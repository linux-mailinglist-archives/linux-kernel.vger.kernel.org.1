Yep, that's how I would describe how LLVM see's inline asm, too.

I recently implemented parsing support for `asm inline` in Clang; I
could have sworn I saw code in LLVM parsing newlines for a size
estimate years ago, but when implementing `asm inline`, I couldn't
find it.  And test cases I wrote that used the C preprocessor to
create thousand+ line inline asm strings would always be inlined,
regardless of the `inline` asm qualifier.

Not sure about implied volatility (...inner stock trader had a laugh
at that...) for output-less asm statements.

Oh, this reminds me of commit d0a8d9378d16 ("x86/paravirt: Make
native_save_fl() extern inline"), where the insertion of stack guards
was also causing some pain.

The cleanest solution would be to have function attributes that say
"yes, I know I said -fstack-protector*, but for this one lone function
I really need -fno-stack-protector.  I know what I'm doing and accept
whatever the consequences are."  But maybe the attribute would be
shorter than all that? :P

Compared to playing games with each other's inlining heuristics, that
would be the cleanest and future-proof solution.  (Then we can even
revert d0a8d9378d16, and use such a function attribute.  I somehow
prefer gnu_inline's semantics to ISO C99's extern inline semantics,
and simultaneously hate the problems for which it's used.)

Sorry, I don't quite follow.  The idea is that an empty asm statement
in foo() should prevent foo() from being inlined into bar()?
