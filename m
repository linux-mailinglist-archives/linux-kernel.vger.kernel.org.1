The ID register (S3_1_C15_c2_5) falls into implementation defined space.
See Arm ARM DDI 0487F.a, section "D12.3.2  Reserved encodings for 
IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED registers".

So, please stop calling this "etm4_cpu_actlr1_cfg". Since,
1) actlr1 is not an architected name for the said encoding
2) The id register could mean something else on another CPU.

Rather this should indicate platform/CPU specific. e.g,

etm4_cpu_hisilicon_config_core_commit()

Please could you move this check to the function above ?
Ideally, it would be good to have something like :

	etm4_config_impdef_features();

And :

	etm4_config_impdef_features(struct etm4_drvdata *drvdata)
	{
		etm4_cpu_hisilicon_config_core_commit(drvdata);
	}

I believe this is hisilicon specific. May be same across their CPUs, may
be a specific one. There is no architectural guarantee.
