Thanks Mark for cc-ing me and joining the dots. I completely forgot about
that fact that this platform was using SCMI using SMC as transport. Sorry
for that and it is my fault. I did review the SCMI/SMC support for this
platform sometime in June/July last year and forgot the fact it is same
platform when voltage/regulator support patches for SD/MMC was posted
sometime later last year. I concentrated on SMCCC conventions and other
details.

Indeed. Please switch to using the new voltage protocol added for this without
any extra code. You just need to wire up DT for this.

Just for curiosity, where is SCMI platform firmware implemented ? On Cortex-A,
secure side or external processor. Does this platform run TF-A ?
