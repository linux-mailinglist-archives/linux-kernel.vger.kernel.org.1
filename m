I am, yes, and it mostly works great. I've hit zero issues with it in
the filesystems I'm generating.

I've run into a few other issues with it in other tools, as well. mke2fs
with inline_data generates invalid files given xattrs:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ext4/20200926102512.GA11386@localhost/T/#u

And extlinux doesn't like inline_data at all:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=971002

I'll report any other issues I run into using inline_data. I agree that
it's deeply underappreciated.
