Agreed, I will post this change soon and will introduce some feature
check as well because we will need it for iommu prot flag as per 
discussion

Right, once I move the LLCC code to a6xx specific address space 
creation,
without LLCC slices for GPU specified in qcom llcc driver, we will not
be using it.
