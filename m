The fact that PTRACE_SYSEMU is only implemented for a few arches makes
we wonder whether it was a misguided addition that should not be ported
to new arches... i.e., why does hardly anyone need it?  But I haven't
attempted to understand the history.

Can't PTRACE_SYSEMU be emulated by using PTRACE_SYSCALL, cancelling the
syscall at the syscall enter stop, then modifying the regs at the
syscall exit stop?


If SYSEMU was obviously always broken, perhaps we can withdraw support
for it.  Assuming nobody is crazy enough to try to emulate execve() I
can't see anything other than sigreturn that would be affected by this
issue though.  So maybe SYSEMU isn't broken enough to justify
withdrawal.
