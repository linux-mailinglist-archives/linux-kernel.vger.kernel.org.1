Just to clarify, if GP has set NO_CB2 in (2), we want CB to set NO_CB3
in 3), right? OTOH if CB has set NO_CB2 in (2), we want GP to set NO_CB3
in (3), right?

The point being to make sure that both threads acknowledge the transition?

And softirq can stop processing callbacks from that point on.

SOFTIRQ2 should be part of what happens in SOFTIRQ1. The transitioning
CPU sets SOFTIRQ1, which is immediately visible by local softirqs,
and wakes up CB/GP. CB/GP sets SOFTIRQ2, CB/GP sets SOFTIRQ3 and
we go back to transitioning code that sets IN_SOFTIRQ.

Or did I miss something?

Agreed. And I really like that it details the whole process in a very
explicit way.

Thanks!
