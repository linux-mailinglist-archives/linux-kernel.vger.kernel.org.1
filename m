I'm not sure how ignoring me for additional 6 months helped the state of
liblockdep.

Right, and there are still benign build warnings around unused
variables which doesn't impede liblockdep's functionality.

Should they be cleaned up? sure, but let's get it working again.

Right, I can't really say how many users of this there are out there. I
get an occasional email with a question or comment but I'm not aware of
how many of those users are out there.

I do think that if we keep liblockdep alive we should do a better job at
not taking commits that break it to begin with. The model where someone
is chasing lockdep to fix breakage after breakage isn't sustainable.

It passes the testsuite, there are compiler warnings that show up on
some gcc versions I'll work on cleaning up.

I'll address these.

How does perf handle doing changes on top of those headers? As an
example, if you look at patch #12, it basically makes userspace ignore
the new "noinstr" annotation, otherwise compiling code that uses
"noinstr" in userspace breaks badly.

For liblockdep it's not enough to just sync headers, we need to do
changes to those headers as well.
