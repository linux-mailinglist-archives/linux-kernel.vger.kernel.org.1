Thanks!  Very helpful explanation.

Are you sure about that?  If I split a THP and each of those subpages
migrates, won't I then see PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS increase by 512?

So why don't we just expose PGMIGRATE_SPLIT?  That would be defined as
the number of times we succeeded in migrating a THP but had to split it
to succeed.
