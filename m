I further refined the concept to B9n X, part of the B9n Fair Pay Projects.

Website is now on https://b9n-web.net/

Further we see a problem with behaviour with Yehova, that calls people 
Nerd, Nigger etc. This is not a Goed ofcourse. Could be the root of 
behaviour problems here aswell. It was also called "Lamenes" earlier in 
the environment, but in Windows that is associated with disabled. It was 
not about disabled though, but Yehovans of said type.

Serenity.
