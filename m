Something that I find interesting, is that hippie times, turned in 
favour of The Dewa, and not really G-d, although it is economically 
compatible. Even Bill Gates negating G-d, is much The Dewa, politically.

And Steve Jobs is known for hindu connections, and the trance culture I 
was part of making myself, post-hippe style, was about The Dewa.

And now it is everything we would want in politics, system design, and 
culture.

I can only strongly suggest using the concept, when referring a certain 
transcendence, and a ban on amanita is fully compatible with science aswell.

Also for Norway to join EU.

Serene Greetings,
Ywe CÃ¦rlyn,
The Fair Pay Initiative.
