I just sent https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200512183839.2373-1-elver@google.com
-- note that, using __*_ONCE in arch_atomic_{read,set} will once again
double-instrument with this. Overall there are 2 options:
1. provide __READ_ONCE/__WRITE_ONCE wrapped purely in data_race(), or
2. make __READ_ONCE/__WRITE_ONCE perform an atomic check so we may
still catch races with plain accesses.
The patch I sent does (2). It is inevitable that these will be used in
places that we did not expect, purely to get around the type check,
which is why I thought it might be the more conservative approach.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
