I held off on the revert because I thought you might want the chance
to submit the revert with your authorship.  I made an assumption that
it meant the same to you as it does to me; that's my mistake, I should
have known better.

I'll do the revert myself for stable-5.8 (which should trickle down to
v5.7.z with the right metadata), don't bother with it.

Sigh.

I can't even reply to that paragraph above without going to GH and
looking up all those different ghak references, which is annoying, and
right now it seems like my time is better spent cleaning up this mess.
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "one patch", but right now we
are at -rc7 and we've/I've got broken kernels to fix; submit whatever
you want and we'll deal with it when it's posted.

Minimal is a one (two?) line NULL check in audit_log_name(), this
patch is not that.
