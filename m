In my last email, I was not saying OVERCOMMIT_NEVER is not a normal case,
but I don't think user will too frequently runtime change the overcommit
policy. And the fix patch of syncing 'vm_committed_as' is only called when
user calls 'sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=2'.

For the original patchset, it keeps vm_committed_as unchanged for
OVERCOMMIT_NEVER policy and enlarge it for the other 2 loose policies
OVERCOMMIT_ALWAYS and OVERCOMMIT_GUESS, and I don't expect the "OVERCOMMIT_NEVER
workloads" performance  will be impacted. If you have suggetions for this
kind of benchmarks, I can test them to better verify the patchset, thanks!
