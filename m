But there is a small problem here. memhp_range_allowed() is now defined
and available with CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG where as vmem_add_mapping() and
__segment_load() are generally available without any config dependency.
So if CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG is not enabled there will be a build failure
in vmem_add_mapping() for memhp_range_allowed() symbol.

We could just move VM_BUG_ON(!memhp_range_allowed(start, size, 1)) check
from vmem_add_mapping() to arch_add_memory() like on arm64 platform. But
then __segment_load() would need that additional new check to compensate
as proposed earlier.

Also leaving vmem_add_mapping() and __segment_load() unchanged will cause
the address range check to be called three times on the hotplug path i.e

1. register_memory_resource()
2. arch_add_memory()
3. vmem_add_mapping()

Moving memhp_range_allowed() check inside arch_add_memory() seems better
and consistent with arm64. Also in the future, any platform which choose
to override arch_get_mappable() will have this additional VM_BUG_ON() in
their arch_add_memory().
