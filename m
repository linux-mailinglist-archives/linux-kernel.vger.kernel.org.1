Actually I don't think adding the suggestion is a good thing if it's
only a "rule-of-thumb-replace-volatile-with-lock".

Actually possibly volatile might not even be needed because there could
be already a lock protecting this.

Put another way: I don't think putting any hint here would help, on the
contrary, somebody has to really look at what protection is needed,
without getting influenced by rules-of-thumb.
