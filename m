Thank you very much for the time and suggestions...

This in-review driver is written for a new nand flash controller IP 
which is used in LGM.

Not ported from xway_nand.c driver , we have developed from the scratch 
to make it work on
Intel LGM SoC , it's new x86 ATOM based SoC, IP itself completely 
different and most of the registers won't match.
if we port then it would be ugly and also what are the problem may occur 
we do not know.
