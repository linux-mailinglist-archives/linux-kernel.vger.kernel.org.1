To quote with an example: using (Power 9)

Power 9 is an SMT 8 core by design. However this 8 thread core can run as 2
independent core with threads 0,2,4 and 6 acting like a core, while threads
1,3,5,7 acting as another core.  

The firmware can decide to showcase them as 2 independent small cores or as
one big core. However the LLC (i.e last level of cache) is shared between
all the threads of the SMT 8 core. Future power chips, LLC might change, it
may be expanded to share with another SMT 8 core or it could be made
specific to SMT 4 core.

The smt 8 core is also known as fused core/ Big core.
The smaller smt 4 core is known as small core.

So on a Power9 Baremetal, the firmware would show up as SMT4 core.
and we have a CACHE level at SMT 8. CACHE level would be very very similar
to MC domain in X86.

Hope this is clear.
