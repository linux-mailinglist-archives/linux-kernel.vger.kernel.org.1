I had understood that you didn't want to see of_* functions used in the 
driver, that's why I was hesitant about the first one.

I would be more for keeping the binding (that, by the way, is not really 
used, the interrupts weren't implemented at all in the driver before me 
doing that) for just one reason, which I'm going to explain with "sort 
of" pseudocode (just to be shorter):

EXAMPLE 1:
labibb {
     interrupts = <0 0>, <1 0>, <2 0>, <3 0>;
     interrupt-names = "lab-sc", "lab-ocp", "ibb-sc", "ibb-ocp";
     lab { };
     ibb { };
};

for (i = 0; i < max_vregs; i++) {
     short_circuit = platform_get_irq(pdev, i * 2);
     overcurrent = platform_get_irq(pdev, ((i * 2) + 1));
}

EXAMPLE 2:

snprintf strings for {lab,ibb}_{shortcircuit,overcurrent}, use 
platform_get_irq_byname
(pdev, blah);

EXAMPLE 3:
labibb {

     lab {
       interrupts = <0 0>, <1 0>;


       interrupt-names = "sc", "ocp";

     };

     ibb {

       interrupts = <2 0>, <3 0>;


       interrupt-names = "sc", "ocp";


     };

};



for (i = 0; i < max_vregs; i++) {

     short_circuit = of_irq_get_byname(node, "sc");

     overcurrent = of_irq_get_byname(node, "ocp");

}


First of all, in the *EXAMPLE 1*, we may be declaring interrupts for 
both LAB and IBB, but actually disabling one of the two regulators: in 
this specific case (I have no idea why anyone would want to do that, but 
evaluating all the cases anyway) the human readability would be way 
lower, in my opinion, as that'd add a possible layer of confusion.
Also, I don't really like having to preallocate an array of chars and 
snprintf names here and there (EXAMPLE 2) on the fly: in my eyes, it 
looks a bit of a mess, but that's a highly personal opinion, many may 
disagree.

In *EXAMPLE 3* everything looks more human readable and, in some way, 
less error-prone, as we can just use two fixed strings and that's it, 
without multiplying this and adding that.


I would go for keeping the current binding for the aforementioned 
reasons. Before I go on sending a V2, I would like to know your opinion.
Do you agree?

Thanks,
