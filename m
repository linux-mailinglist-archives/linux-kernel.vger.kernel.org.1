Ok, I can do that instead.

Well, at least the first one should really be unnecessary: the previous
line sets it as 1 + x. When I see that it actually confuses me: I think
I must be missing some edge case where it could be zero.

The second one is also unnecessary, but I agree it might require a bit
of analysis to see that it is.

It's just reformatting now that we can have more than 80-column lines. I
think it's clearer this way, more obvious that you're dividing by
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN and adding one, rather than "did he forget the
parentheses here".
