Agreed, I think it's important to figure out what's going on here before we
try to bodge around it.

Adding Szabolcs, in case he has any ideas.

To save him reading the whole thread, here's a summary:

AArch64 kernel modules built with binutils 2.35 end up with a couple of
ELF sections marked as SHF_WRITE | SHF_ALLOC | SHF_EXECINSTR:

[ 5] .plt PROGBITS 0000000000000388 01d000 000008 00 WAX  0   0  1
[ 6] .init.plt NOBITS 0000000000000390 01d008 000008 00  WA  0   0  1
[ 7] .text.ftrace_trampoline PROGBITS 0000000000000398 01d008 000008 00 WAX  0   0  1

This results in the module being rejected by our loader, because we don't
permit writable, executable mappings.

Our linker script for these entries uses NOLOAD, so it's odd to see PROGBITS
appearing in the readelf output above (and older binutils emits NOBITS
sections). Anyway, here's the linker script:

SECTIONS {
	.plt (NOLOAD) : { BYTE(0) }
	.init.plt (NOLOAD) : { BYTE(0) }
	.text.ftrace_trampoline (NOLOAD) : { BYTE(0) }
}

It appears that the name of the section influences the behaviour, as
Jessica observed [1] that sections named .text.* end up with PROGBITS,
whereas random naming such as ".test" ends up with NOBITS, as before.

We've looked at the changelog between binutils 2.34 and 2.35, but nothing
stands out. Any clues? Is this intentional binutils behaviour?

Thanks,

Will
