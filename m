In the past I have seen issues with niceness and CFS. Those issues were
related to tick granularity, if the scheduler tick is too coarse, then
scheduler may allow a low priority task to run for a bit longer. But this
also means that higher priority tasks will take even longer to catch up to
the vruntime of the lower priority ones. IIRC, this can run into several
seconds.

Not fully sure if that's what you're seeing. If you drop the niceness by some
amount, does the issue go away or get better?

There is a CFS tracepoint called sched:sched_stat_runtime. That could be
enabled to see what happens to the vruntime values on the wakeup of the lower
prio task.

I'm also seeing the LOCK05 failure, I see that some writer threads are in
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state shown by hung task detector on LOCK05. So these
writers didn't wake up for over 2 minutes to begin with:

Could this just be a side effect of the issue you are seeing?  (A writer
acquired a lock but never got CPU to release it, which inturn caused lock
acquirers to block in D-state indefinitely).

thanks,
