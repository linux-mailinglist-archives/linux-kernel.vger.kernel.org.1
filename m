After thinking about it, it should be easy to make it configurable since
as stated it is up the the pre-launch code to decide where the buffer
is. To do this, the static buffer will be removed from the OS-MLE
structure. In its place there will be two fields:

u64 evt_log_base;
u64 evt_log_size;

If the entity setting up the buffer wants to place the log in the TXT
heap, it simply allocates memory after the OS-MLE fixed structure and
points evt_log_base there. If a buffer outside of the heap is wanted,
just point evt_log_base there. If the MLE wants to determine if the log
is in the TXT heap, it just has to compare evt_log_base to the TXT heap
extents.
