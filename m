Ah-ha! Thanks for the heads-up. :)

This is coming from:

Yup, good.

Okay, cool. It's not critical, I don't think.

I see the KTAP RFC doesn't discuss subtests at all, but kselftest actually
already handles subtests. I strongly feel that line-start formatting is
the correct way to deal with this, with each subtest having it's own
self-contained KTAP. This allows for several important features:

- the subtest, run on its own, needs no knowledge about its execution
  environment: it simply emits its standard KTAP output.

- subtest output can be externally parsed separably, without any
  knowledge or parsing of the enclosing test.

For example, with my recent series[1], "make -C seccomp run_tests"
produces:

TAP version 13
1..2
# selftests: seccomp: seccomp_bpf
# TAP version 13
# 1..77
# # Starting 77 tests from 6 test cases.
# #  RUN           global.mode_strict_support ...
# #            OK  global.mode_strict_support
# ok 1 global.mode_strict_support
...
# ok 77 TSYNC.two_siblings_not_under_filter
# # FAILED: 73 / 77 tests passed.
# # Totals: pass:72 fail:4 xfail:1 xpass:0 skip:0 error:0
not ok 1 selftests: seccomp: seccomp_bpf # exit=1
# selftests: seccomp: seccomp_benchmark
#
not ok 2 selftests: seccomp: seccomp_benchmark # TIMEOUT

For the KTAP parsing, actually think it's very important to include
kernel log lines in the test output (as diagnostic lines), since they
are "unexpected" (they fail to have the correct indentation) and may
provide additional context for test failures when reading log files.
(As in the "vmalloc: allocation failure" line in the quoted section
above, to be included as a diagnostic line for test #3.)

Cool. Yeah, it's not required, but I think there are two use cases:
humans running a single test (where is a summary is valuable, especially
for long tests that scroll off the screen), and automation (where it can
ignore the summary, as it will produce its own in a regularized fashion).

Cool. Yeah, I'd like to keep things as close as possible. In looking at
this again, I wonder if perhaps it would be better to change the
"indent" from "# " to "  ", which might make things more readable for
both dmesg and terminal output:

[   36.611358]   TAP version 14
[   36.611953]   1..1
[   36.611958]     TAP version 14
[   36.611954]     1..3
...
[   36.622914]     # overflow_calculation_test: s64: 21 arithmetic tests
[   36.624020]     ok 1 - overflow_calculation_test
...
[   36.731096]     # overflow_shift_test: ok: (s64)(0 << 63) == 0
[   36.731840]     ok 2 - overflow_shift_test
...
[   36.750294] kunit_try_catch: vmalloc: allocation failure: 18446744073709551615 bytes, mode:0xcc0(GFP_KERNEL), nodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0
...
[   36.805350]     # overflow_allocation_test: devm_kzalloc detected saturation
[   36.807763]     ok 3 - overflow_allocation_test
[   36.807763]     # overflow: PASS
[   36.807765]   ok 1 - overflow
[   36.807767]   # kunit: PASS

As it happens, subtests are a bit rare in kselftests right now, but
for kunit, the "common" output (IIUC) will fundamentally be a top-level
test running all the subtests, so we should get it right. :)
