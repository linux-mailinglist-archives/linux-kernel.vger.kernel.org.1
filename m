Yes, I've never seen a machine on which vm/stat_refresh reported -16000
or less, or anything approaching that (true, this laptop does not have
128 cpus, but...).  Maybe they get reinstalled or otherwise rebooted
before reaching numbers of that magnitude.  Maybe having the warnings
shown at much lower magnitudes has helped to root-cause and eliminate
some of them.

Waiting until the heat-death-of-the-universe theoretical worst case is
so unhelpful as to defeat the purpose of the warning.  I think you do
understand, but perhaps not all readers of this thread understand,
that vm/stat_refresh merges all per-cpu counts into the global atomic
immediately before deciding negative.  The only problem is that
"immediately" is not instantaneous across cpus, so the possibility
of work started on one cpu but completed on another during the course
of the refresh, causing false negatives, is real though not great.

It's true that while developing, we can all make mistakes so big that
"eventually" will show up quickly, and even that warning could help.
But since you'll only show them when they reach -16000 (sorry, I keep
going back to the 128 cpu case, just to make it more vivid), it won't
be of any use to catch races later in development, or in production.

Whereas my own patch would just fix the missing items, and continue
to annoy you with occasional ignorable warnings - so I cannot submit
that, and wouldn't want to submit it right now, without having tried
it out for a while, to check what kind of noise it will generate.

So I thought it best, either to leave mm/vmstat.c alone for the moment,
or else just delete the disputed and incomplete code; coming back to
it later when we have something we can agree upon.

But I think you're preferring to resubmit your 125*nr_cpus patch to akpm,
with the missing NR_VM_NODE_STAT_ITEMS added in (as either one or two
patches), with foreshortened testing but the reassurance that since
it's so hard to reach the point of showing the warnings, new negatives
will either be quiet, or easily fixed before v5.10 released: okay,
I can more easily Hack that to my preference than Ack it or Nak it.
