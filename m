Thank you for finding this bug.  In this case, the "d" field has to be
limited to md5 or sha1 as the field is not large enough for other
algorithms.  Just as the IMA Kconfig and the "ima_template=" boot
command line option prevent enabling a sha256 hash with the original
"ima" template, the "ima_template_fmt=" boot command line option
similarly needs to prevent a 'd' field being defined with a larger
digest.  Failing to set the new template format should revert to using
the builtin default definition.

thanks,

Mimi
