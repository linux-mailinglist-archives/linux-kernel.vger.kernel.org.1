I didn't mention this before, but that combination of events doesn't 
make sense.  The MMF bit is supposed to get set only for queue heads in 
the periodic list, that is, only for interrupt transactions.  But 
ehci_clear_tt_buffer() doesn't do anything for interrupt endpoints; it 
tests specifically for that right at the start.

Maybe your EHCI controller is setting the MMF bit when it shouldn't.  
The usbmon output will help clear this up.

Or maybe the hubs you are testing don't work right.  That's the only 
reason I can think of for the failures you see with the USB-3 
controller; the way it operates is very different from the way EHCI 
does.
