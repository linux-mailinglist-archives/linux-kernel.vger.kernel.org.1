Thanks for detailed changelog. I will use yours in v2, which will be posted
shortly. A nit is the correct commit ID would be 8eb7e28d4c642c31 instead
of 8eb7e28d4c642c31i :)

Sure, It will be included in v2.

Yep, I'll change the code accordingly in v2. Also, symbol @idmap_pg_end
will be added to vmlinux.lds.S as it's not existing.
