How about just getting rid of this loop entirely, along with the 
u132_static_list?  As far as I can see, that list doesn't do anything.

Not to mention that this driver has no business calling 
platform_device_unregister() here, since it didn't call 
platform_device_register() in the first place.  The call to 
platform_driver_unregister() below should do all the necessary work.
