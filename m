Hi Mark, Morimoto-san,

> Summary of changes:
>   * Support multiple instances of a component. For example there can be
>     multiple I2S devices which can use the same component driver.
>
>   * Support open platforms with empty Codec endpoint. Customers can plug
>     their own HW and can populate codec endpoint.
>
>   * In a component model there can be many components which can be
>     connected togethe. In such cases Identify no-pcm DPCM DAI links which
>     can be used in BE<->BE connections.
>
>   * Add Tegra audio graph driver which is based on generic audio graph
>     driver and specific customizations are done in Tegra driver.
>
>   * This pushes DT support for Tegra210 based platforms which uses
>     audio-graph card and above enhancements.
>
> The series is based on following references where DPCM usgae for Tegra
> Audio and simple-card driver proposal were discussed.
>
>   * https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/4/30/519 (DPCM for Tegra)
>   * https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/6/27/4 (simple-card driver)
>
> Changelog
> =========
>
> v3 -> v4
> --------
>   * Added new patches to convert graph.txt and audio-graph-card.txt
>     to corresponding json-schema files. Later these references
>     are used in Tegra audio graph schema.
>
>   * AHUB component binding docs are updated to reflect the usage
>     of ports/port/endpoint
>
>   * More common stuff is moved into graph_parse_of() and this is
>     used by both generic and Tegra audio graph.
>
>   * DT binding for Tegra audio graph is updated to included "ports { }"
>
>   * As per the suggestion 'void *data' member is dropped from
>     'asoc_simple_priv' and instead container method is used to
>     maintain required custom data internal to Tegra audio graph.
>
> v2 -> v3
> --------
>   * Dropped new compatible addition in generic graph driver
>     after reviewing it with Morimoto-san. Instead added Tegra
>     audio graph driver and new compatibles are added in the same.
>   * Added new patches to expose new members for customization
>     in audio graph driver.
>   * Added new patch for Tegra audio graph driver and related
>     documentation.
>   * Minor change in below commit where mutex version of helper is used
>     "ASoC: audio-graph: Identify 'no_pcm' DAI links for DPCM"
>   * DT binding is updated to use the newly exposed compatibles
>   * No changes in other patches
>
> v1 -> v2
> --------
>   * Re-organized ports/endpoints description for ADMAIF and XBAR.
>     Updated DT patches accordingly.
>   * After above change, multiple Codec endpoint support is not
>     required and hence dropped for now. This will be considered
>     separately if at all required in future.
>   * Re-ordered patches in the series.

>
> Sameer Pujar (15):
>    ASoC: soc-core: Fix component name_prefix parsing
>    ASoC: soc-pcm: Get all BEs along DAPM path
>    ASoC: audio-graph: Use of_node and DAI for DPCM DAI link names
>    ASoC: audio-graph: Identify 'no_pcm' DAI links for DPCM
>    ASoC: audio-graph: Support empty Codec endpoint
>    ASoC: audio-graph: Expose new members for asoc_simple_priv
>    ASoC: audio-graph: Expose helpers from audio graph

Would you suggest to keep above in a separate series and thus not 
blocked by below doc updates? If so do I need to resend above in a next 
revision or if these are good to be picked up?

>    Documentation: of: Convert graph bindings to json-schema
>    ASoC: dt-bindings: audio-graph: Convert bindings to json-schema
>    ASoC: dt-bindings: tegra: Add graph bindings
>    ASoC: dt-bindings: tegra: Add json-schema for Tegra audio graph card

Documentation patches in the series have some dependency over 
Morimoto-san's audio-graph series 
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/alsa-devel/list/?series=372759. I 
will update doc related patches once dependency is merged.

>    ASoC: tegra: Add audio graph based card driver
>    arm64: defconfig: Enable Tegra audio graph card driver
>    arm64: tegra: Audio graph header for Tegra210
>    arm64: tegra: Audio graph sound card for Jetson Nano and TX1
