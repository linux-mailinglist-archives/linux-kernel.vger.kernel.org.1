A few weeks ago, I asked if anyone had a better suggestion about how to 
cope with this comment for bitmap_cut(). As far as I can see, this is 
the first response.

I don't see this as a syntax violation. I see it as the failure of 
kernel-doc to cope with a perfectly reasonable construction. I suggest 
that kernel-doc should recognise that the first use of @src: is as a 
param definition, and that the second use isn't.

Actually the *main* bug here is that the second use messes up the sphinx 
link/search info for this function by overwriting the correct first use.

Making editorial changes to the text seems to me a bad way to get rid of 
warnings. If we are saying that the original developer "got it wrong" 
then we need to say how. I assert that this idiom is not wrong, and we 
should not need to add even minor verbosity to the wording.

Developers like compact idioms: someone will use this again before long. 
Are you going to keep telling developers that they are wrong? This is 
not a good way to encourage developers to compose annotation.

It's a similar problem to REST's love of multiple line breaks. Maybe one 
or two are not a big problem, but many little infelicities added 
together make the C comments less useful as annotation for developers.
