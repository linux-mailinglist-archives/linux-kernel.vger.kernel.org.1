I manually reordered the lines and that's indeed quite a mess :o)

Yep, eventually I hope we can put all these crucial pieces on the common entry
code.

Perfect! That's what I assumed as well.

I think it was there in case an exception would schedule after context tracking
exit kernel but before we actually exit kernel. But we removed that (Andy probably)
when we made sure the early entry was not interruptible. Now some other archs
still use it, I'm just not sure if they do it for a good reason...

Perfect!

Right. My fear was rather on special areas that temporarily
enable tracing (instrumentation_begin()...instrumentation_end())
but those should only happen with interrupts disabled on entry code
with preempt_schedule_notrace() having no effect.

Thanks a lot for confirming! I guess I can remove
exception_enter()/exit() on x86. Fortunately any issue
will be very easily spotted.

Thanks!
