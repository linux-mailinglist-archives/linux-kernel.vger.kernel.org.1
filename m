I have not looked into the data in depth but it's worth noting that
cpuidle changed the time a CPU spent polling before entering a C state
within the same window.  See 36fcb4292473 ("cpuidle: use first valid target
residency as poll time") as an example where poll time went from hundreds
of nanoseconds to single digits depending on the machine. We used to poll
for up to a tick before entering idle. I'm not saying whether it's good
or bad but it certainly can have a big impact on how often a CPU enters
"true idle in a C state" as opposed to switching to the idle task (swapper)
for some house keeping.

Where things get fun is that the scheduler can make this more or less
obvious depending on its decisions. If tasks are bouncing like crazy around
a socket, the load balancer is shifting tasks like crazy or the scheduler
is stacking tasks when it should not then it can potentially perform
better in a benchmark if it prevents tasks entering a deep idle state.
