Cool, I registered as well.

Cool, I see it has some Reviewed-by tags so that's a good sign. Will
look more into that.

Yes, I was aware of this. But if we use task groups, then the
transition from schedtune -> uclamp means now the tasks that use
uclamp would also be subjected to cpu.shares. That's why we were
looking into the per-task interface and glad there's some work on this
already done.

Thanks!
