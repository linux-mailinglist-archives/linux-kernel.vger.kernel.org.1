Ooh, that thing. I thought P9 was in actual fact an SMT4 hardware part,
but to be compatible with P8 it has this fused option where two cores
act like a single SMT8 part.

The interleaving enumeration is done due to P7 asymmetric cores,
resuting in schedulers having the preference to use the lower threads.

Combined that results in a P9-fused configuration using two independent
full cores when there's only 2 runnable threads.

Which is a subtly different story from yours.

But reading your explanation, it looks like the Linux topology setup
could actually unravel the fused-faux-SMT8 into two independent SMT4
parts, negating that firmware option.

Anyway, a few comments just around there might be helpfull.


Thanks!
