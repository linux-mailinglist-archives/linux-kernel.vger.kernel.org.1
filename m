But it's also reasonable for someone to have written an application
assuming that the current behaviour won't change.

As I understand it, if we change net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling, that will
take effect only for new connections, and not for existing ones.

I think the _real_ problem is that readahead never scales down, except
for EIO.

I don't have time to take on another project right now, but I think this
patch is too simplistic and has too many downsides.  Someone needs to
really think the readahead situation through properly.
