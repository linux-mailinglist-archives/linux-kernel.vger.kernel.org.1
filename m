Yep, we skip the page_counter for root, but keep in mind that cgroup1
*does* have a root-level memory.stat, so (for the most part) we've
been keeping consumer stats for the root level the whole time.

Yep, that's heritage from cgroup1.

You're right. It should only bypass the page_counter, but still set
page->mem_cgroup = root_mem_cgroup, just like user pages.

This counter also doesn't get exported on cgroup1, so it would indeed
be a new bug. It needs to be fixed before this patch here.

> - memcg_charge_slab (NR_SLAB*) skips over root memcg as well

Same thing with these two.
