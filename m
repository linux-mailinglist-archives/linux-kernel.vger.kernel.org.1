Got ya. :)

One last thing... I was thinking on adding such section (dynamic array
usage) to coding-style.rst, explaining how to use struct_size() and
transform the different open-coded versions we currently have in the
kernel, e.g. I have seen people use offsetof() --and sometimes open-coded
versions of sizeof_field()-- and its open-coded version to do arithmetic
in allocator arguments.
