Hi, Brian,

I think I can understand you on the weirdness when comparing to the
pipes.  And IIUC that's majorly what POLLHUP is used for - it tells us
that the channel has closed.  I believe it's the same to a pair of
send/recv sockets when one end closes the port so the other side can
get a POLLHUP.

However IMO userfaultfd is not such a channel like pipes, as you have
already mentioned.  It's not paired ports.  As you've given the other
example on "closing the read pipe when reading the read pipe" - I'm
curious what will happen for that.  I feel like it'll happen the same
way as being blocked, just like what userfaultfd and eventfd are
doing.  My understanding is that the Linux kernel should be thread
safe on all these operations so no matter how we use the syscalls and
in what order the kernel shouldn't break with this.  However IMHO it
does not mean that it'll guarantee things like "close() will kick all
existing fd operations".  I don't know whether there's any restriction
in POSIX or anything for this, but... I won't be too surprised if
someone tells me there's some OS that will directly crash the process
if one fd is close()ed during a read()...

Thanks,
