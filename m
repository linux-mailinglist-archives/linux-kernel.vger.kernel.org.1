Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: example: Extend based on practice
Date:   Thu, 10 Sep 2020 20:47:06 +0200
Message-Id: <20200910184706.9677-1-krzk@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Extend the example schema with common rules which seems to be not that
obvious:
1. Expecting arrays of phandles to be always ordered, regardless if
   "xxx-names" is provided (e.g. clocks),
2. Add example of altering a property based on presence of other
   property,
3. Document usage of unevaluatedProperties.
