Exactly, they will likely look different, but since we want conservative
numbers for the generic case it's ok/good to use numbers from a
configuration without heatsink.

And 1.9 GHz doesn't even seem horribly slow for a device with a heatsink.
When we have such a device we can evaluate whether there are significant
gains from tweaking the values for the big cores in the device specific DT.
