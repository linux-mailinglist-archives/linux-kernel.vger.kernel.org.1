I did not (mean to) suggest replacing existing sprintf() calls in sysfs
show methods. But when changes _are_ being made, such as when replacing
snprintf() calls for whatever reasons, can we please not make it harder
for people doing manual audits (those are "code checkers" as well, I
suppose, but they do tend to only make noise when finding something).

git grep doesn't immediately show that, not even with a suitable -C
argument, as you can't really know the potential callers unless you open
the file and see that the function is only assigned as a .show method.
And even that can be a pain because it's all hidden behind five levels
of magic macros that build identifiers with ##.

I'm perfectly well aware of that, TYVM (you may want to 'git log
--author Villemoes lib/vsprintf.c').

 but the number of bytes that *would have been written if

Huh? This all seems utterly irrelevant WRT a change that replaces
PAGE_SIZE by INT_MAX (because that's what sprintf() is going to pretend
you passed). You get the same return value.

But I'm not at all concerned about whether one passes the proper buffer
size or not in sysfs show methods; with my embedded hat on, I'm all for
saving a few bytes of .text here and there. The problem, as far as I'm
concerned, is merely that adding sprintf() callers makes it harder to
find the problematic sprintf() instances.

My bad, for a moment I forgot that code and patterns of that vintage
cannot have bugs.
