There are 3 dependencies that we tracked between SoundWire and ASoC 
subsystems:

a) addition of SDCA control macro (needed before SDCA codec drivers can 
be shared)
b) this series - we could indeed submit the codec changes to Mark's tree 
separately, but then the SoundWire tree would be broken: the codec 
drivers would still try to allocate dynamically what is now a fixed-size 
array.
c) configuration of the interrupt masks in codec drivers instead of 
hard-coded in bus driver + spurious parity error workaround (not posted 
yet but ready).

The changes in ASoC codecs are really only on the initialization part 
(either removing a dynamic allocation or setting masks), there's no 
functional change otherwise.

I think the simplest to avoid multiple back-and-forth is to have these 
small interface/initialization changes merged through the SoundWire 
subsystem, then merged by Mark from a single immutable tag. Would this 
work for everyone?

In addition, there's a WIP change to regmap to add support for SoundWire 
1.2 MBQ-based register access, but this only affects regmap and ASoC 
trees, all handled by Mark.

I don't think we have any other cross-tree changes planned for now, the 
SDCA infrastructure plumbing is still rather open.
