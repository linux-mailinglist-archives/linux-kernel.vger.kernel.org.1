I agree, I'm running short on it too.  I thought what you pointed out with
find_module() [1] was quite interesting.  I tried it on my side but used
request_module() rather than request_module_nowait() - because we do want to
wait for the namespace driver to be loaded before moving forward.  Unfortunatly
the system hung on me...  I still don't know why, I will have to investigate
further.

Regarding your patch on components, I am now up to speed with the concept.
That too is interesting but likely an overkill for the current
situation. Right now we have a single driver to deal with and I think we should
keep things as simple as possible.  

I'll talk to you guys on Monday,
Mathieu
