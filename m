Ah, so this is the kernel maintainer's syndrome: you see an API which
isn't quite right for your use case, so you update or change it.  Then
you see other use cases for it and suddenly to you it becomes the best
thing since sliced bread and with a one ring to rule them all mentality
you exhort everyone to use this new API everywhere.  See this comment
in the merge commit (495d714ad1400) which comes from the merge cover
letter:

Then you forget about it until someone else acts on your somewhat ill
considered instruction and actually tries the replacement.  Once
someone takes up your cause, the API shows up in dozens of emails and
the actual debate about whether or not this is such a good API really
begins, with the poor person who picked it up caught in the crossfire.

As maintainers we really should learn to put the cart before the horse.

James
