Good Day,

I know that this mail might be a surprise to you, but i plead that you
take a little time to read this it,  if it is something you can
handle, then you reply me.

I work with one of the leading banks in my country, and i have worked
with this bank for more than 11yrs, There is an abandoned sums of
money in an account belonging to one of our customers, i tried to
investigate to know why the account is dormant for years without any
finacial operation with the account, then i found out that the owner
of the said account was involved in a motor accident which claimed his
life and the life of his wife and two children leaving no one to claim
the fund as next of kin, this make the account open to any one that
can come with a vitel information to claim the fund.

I know much about the existence of this fund and the secrets
urrounding this money. But before I disclose the full details to you,I
will like to know your interest and willingness to assist me in
claiming this fund, if you are willing then revert back to me with
your:

for further confidential details about the said fund. Thanks and hope
to hear from you soon, note that this is risky free, trouble free and
problem free.
