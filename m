Hello Michał,

Definitely there are board parts that are reused by different devices.
This is not surprising since most of the boards are designed by the same
company.

I don't think it's really possible in a case of Nexus 7 because in
overall the used hardware components differ a bit too much. It shouldn't
worth the effort, IMO.

Yes, perhaps this could be done. The memory timings on Grouper and
Tilapia are pretty much the same as well. As you noticed, there are some
tuning differences of TF300T in comparison to the Nexus 7, the same
applies to the Grouper and Tilapia variants.

The MC timings are exactly the same on Grouper and Tilapia, but EMC
timings have a very minor differences, and thus, the common.dtsi misses
these differentiating EMC timings, they are defined in grouper.dtsi and
tilapia.dts.

I guess we indeed could try to select the lowest common denominator
timing and re-use it. I'll consider this change for v9, thank you very
much for the suggestion.
