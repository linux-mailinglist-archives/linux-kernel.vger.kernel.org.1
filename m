After thinking about this, I am thinking that we should apply similiar logic
as done with the 'cpu-pm' related features.
This way the user can choose between passing through the IA32_SPEC_CTRL,
(and in this case, we can since the user choose it, pass it right away, and thus
avoid using kvm_spec_ctrl_valid_bits completely), and between correctness,
in which case we can always emulate this msr, and therefore check all the bits,
both regard to guest and host supported values.
Does this makes sense, or do you think that this is overkill?

One thing for sure, we currently have a bug about wrong #GP in case STIBP is supported,
but IBRS isn't. I don't mind fixing it in any way that all of you agree upon.

Best regards,
