minor nit: Instead of spilling the cleanup of the files allover the
tests, could we use trap ... exit to cleanup ?

i.e,

cleanup_files()
{
	# Cleanups here
	# rm -f ....
}

trap cleanup_files exit

Couldn't this be :
		device_name=$(basename $path) ?

This may not be fatal to the testing. Could be a warning and continue on
to the next device ?

---- Cut end ---

minor nit: Could this be moved into a function ? say, is_device_sink() ?

Rest looks fine to me.
