OK, several hours of dumb build+config mistakes later, I was actually=20
able to reproduce the failure and walk through things.  There is a=20
trivial fix for the issues in the X modesetting driver, working off=20
Daniel Stone's claim that gbm_bo_get_modifier() should only be called=20
when the allocation was made with gbm_bo_create_with_modifiers().=20
modeset doesn't respect that requirement now in the case that the atomic=20
modesetting path is disabled, which is always the case currently because=20
that path is broken.  Respecting that requirement is a half-liner and=20
allows X to start properly.

If I force modeset to use the atomic path, X still fails to start with=20
the above fix, validating the second theory I'd had:

-Current Mesa nouveau code basically ignores the modifier list passed in=20
unless it is a single modifier requesting linear layout, and goes about=20
allocating whatever layout it sees fit, and succeeds the allocation=20
despite being passed a list of modifiers it knows nothing about.  Not=20
great, fixed in my pending patches, obviously doesn't help existing=20
deployed userspace.

-Current Mesa nouveau code, when asked what modifier it used for the=20
above allocation, returns one of the "legacy" modifiers nouveau DRM-KMS=20
knows nothing about.

-When the modeset driver tries to create an FB for that BO with the=20
returned modifier, the nouveau kernel driver of course refuses.

I think it's probably worth fixing the modesetting driver for the=20
reasons Daniel Vetter mentioned.  Then if I get my Mesa patches in=20
before a new modesetting driver with working Atomic support is released,=20
there'll be no need for long-term workarounds in the kernel.

Down to the real question of what to do in the kernel to support current=20
userspace code: I still think the best fix is to accept the old=20
modifiers but not advertise them.  However, Daniel Stone and others, if=20
you think this will actually break userspace in other ways (Could you=20
describe in a bit more detail or point me to test cases if so?), I=20
suppose the only option would be to advertise & accept the old modifiers=20
for now, and I suppose at a config option at some point to phase the old=20
ones out, eventually drop them entirely.  This would be unfortunate,=20
because as I mentioned, it could sometimes result in situations where=20
apps think they can share a buffer between two devices but will get=20
garbled data in practice.

I've included an initial version of the kernel patch inline below.=20
Needs more testing, but I wanted to share it in case anyone has feedback=20
on the idea, wants to see the general workflow, or wants to help test.

Accept the DRM_FORMAT_MOD_NVIDIA_16BX2_BLOCK()
family of modifiers to handle broken userspace
Xorg modesetting and Mesa drivers.
