This provides a generic code to handle any intra-function call. Currently we have
the RSB stuffing ones which are forgotten with the UNWIND_HINT_TYPE_RADDR_DELETE
directive. And for retpoline, they will not return if we have an indirect jump
(JMP_NOSPEC) but they will return if we have an indirect call (CALL_NOSPEC). The
code can handle both cases. For example, if we were to have a CALL_NOSPEC invocation
which is not in an alternative then objtool can now correctly handle it.
