Yes, I had similar thoughts, so I posted following patch.

I've checked your patch but sorry I'm also not very sure if it's the expected 
behavior.

I just think it's easy to understand, that is the metric calculated by the 
counts per interval.

Adding var in 'struct stats' looks not enough (or more complicated), because 
perf-stat also needs to report some counts according to different aggregation 
modes (not only the metric). I just think copying total counts to current counts 
is a easy way because we can reuse most of existing non-interval processing code.
