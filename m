Just to clarify, what I was talking about there is largely orthogonal to 
the issue here. That was about systems with limited translation 
resources letting translation be specifically opt-in by IOMMU-aware 
drivers. It probably *would* happen to obviate the issue of disrupting 
live DMA at boot time on these particular Tegra platforms, but we still 
need something like Thierry's solution in general, since IOMMU drivers 
may have no other way to determine whether devices are active at boot 
and they have to take care to avoid breaking anything - e.g. SMMUv3 will 
at a bare minimum need to set up *some* form of valid stream table entry 
for the relevant device(s) right at the beginning where we first probe 
and reset the SMMU itself, regardless of what happens with domains and 
addresses later down the line.

FWIW I've already cooked up identity domain support for tegra-gart; I 
was planning on tackling it for tegra-smmu as well for the next version 
of my arm default domains series (which will be after the next -rc1 now 
since I'm just about to take some long-overdue holiday).

I doubt I suggested that in general, because I've always firmly believed 
it to be a terrible idea. I've debugged too many cases where firmware or 
kexec has inadvertently left DMA running and corrupted kernel memory, so 
in general we definitely *don't* want to blindly trust random hardware 
state. Anything I may have said in relation to Qualcomm's fundamentally 
broken hypervisor/bootloader setup should not be considered outside that 
specific context ;)
