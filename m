Any update on the status here?  If I'm reading the conversation above,
Robin said: "we'll *always* see the warning because there's no way to
tear down the default DMA domains, and even if all devices *have* been
nicely quiesced there's no way to tell".  Did I understand that
properly?  If so, it seems like it's fully expected to see this
message on every reboot and it doesn't necessarily signify anything
bad.
