Hi Boris,

Yes, it is the case in the documentation. The time unit is nanoseconds:
       st,fmc2_ebi_cs_address_setup:
         description: This property defines the duration of the address
                      setup phase in ns used for asynchronous read/write 
transactions.
         $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32

Thanks to have review this proposal.

Regards,
Christophe Kerello.
