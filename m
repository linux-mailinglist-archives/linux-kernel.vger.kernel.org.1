This would be a regression. People put huge effort into having early boot
timestamps, see

Adding some active people from this patchset into CC.

I wonder if we could have these early timestamps also in the mono clock.

At least "crash" tool would need an update anyway. AFAIK, it checks
the size of struct printk_log and refuses to read it when it changes.

It means that the hack with VMCOREINFO_FIELD_OFFSET probably is not
needed because we would need to update the crashdump-related tools anyway.

Well, the timing is good. We are about to switch the printk ring
buffer into a lockless one. It requires updating the crashdump tools
as well. We could do this at the same time. The lockless ring buffer
already is in linux-next. It is aimed for 5.10 or 5.11. We are still
discussion handling of continuous lines that might need another change
in the internal structures, see
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200717234818.8622-1-john.ogness@linutronix.de

It would be great to synchronize all these changes changes of the
printk log buffer structures.

Best Regards,
Petr
