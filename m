Could you include that in the commit message. Thanks.

So is like a token (actually a ring of tokens) to make sure the response matches
with the question.

if (response.token != in_msg->hdr.token)
    ignore the response

This id dancing (expected_id, current_id, id) confused me a bit. IMO the code
will be more readable simply with token or id for both, the response and the
question, and have a next_token/id. But I don't have a strong preference, so I
will let you the final decision.

Ok.

Still, I am wondering if is a good idea to have this message rate limited
(dev_err_ratelimited) If for some reason the ISH code is bad or losts sync the
kernel can be flooded by this message and being annoying.

Please resend the patch modifying the commit message and using
