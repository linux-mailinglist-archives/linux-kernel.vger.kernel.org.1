I was not aware of this email thread. I will have a look. Thanks!

OK, I've managed to miss the early break on hugetlb_cma[node] == NULL
there as well. I do not think this makes much sense. Just consider a
setup with one node much smaller than others (not unseen on LPAR
configurations) and then you are potentially using CMA areas on some
nodes without a good reason.

I do not follow. Isn't the s@break@continue@ in this and
alloc_gigantic_page path enough to make it work?
