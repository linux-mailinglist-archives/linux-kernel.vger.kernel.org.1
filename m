Not mentioned the time lost by compiling and properly manage my own toolchain in an automated environment, using such new version of compilers means that I have to inevitably deal with compiler bugs occasionally. Anyway, it is just some other more bugs I have to deal with, and I donâ€™t have a better solution to offer right now.

Please let me know if there are any issues!

Do note that in order to get support for Marco's series, you will need
to have a version of LLVM that includes [1], which the current
--use-good-revision does not. You can checkout that revision exactly
through the '-b' ('--branch') parameter:

$ ./build-llvm.py -b 5a2c31116f412c3b6888be361137efd705e05814

I also see another patch in LLVM that concerns KCSAN [2] but that does
not appear used in Marco's series. Still might be worth having available
in your version of clang.

I'll try to bump the hash that '--use-good-revision' uses soon. I might
wait until 5.7 final so that I can do both at the same time like I
usually do but we'll see how much time I have.
