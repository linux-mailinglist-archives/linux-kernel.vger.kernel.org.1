Thanks for the CC! Ironically I had noticed this series yesterday at the
end of my day and thought to myself, "that's great; I need to go Ack
that tomorrow" and added it to my TODO list. :P

This is a reasonable concern; to me the rationale is clear, but you have
a point that it's not very well spelled out. From my perspective I see
the following benefits:

- The code is simplified because now there is a single lifetime counter
  and it goes in the right place: ns_common ... because it's common to
  all of the namespaces. (Yes there are other counters, but the lifetime
  count is common to all of them.) And the stats on the refactoring
  seems to support it with "51 insertions(+), 72 deletions(-)" which,
  while not "proof" that it's correct, is a positive signal that it's
  going in the right direction, implying a reduced maintenance cost.

- refcount_t is safer than atomic_t, and just as fast[1].

- This reduces the atomic_t -> refcount_t delta[2] that is still pending
  from Elena's efforts started in 2017.

So, while the commit logs could perhaps be clarified (and maybe include
a "in preparation for showing namespaces in ..." prefix describing the
work that triggered this clean-up), I think this is a good idea. Please
consider the whole series:
