Aye aye, this is a daft constvar placement from my end, apologies.

For the SD_DEGENERATE_GROUPS_MASK, that one could directly be shoved into
kernel/sched/topology.c (or done via an enum, I don't care too much).

I suppose the other one causing you grief is sd_flag_debug[]; that one too
really shouldn't be in a header. I need to access that in two separate
files, so I guess I'll have to cook up some wrappers.

Let me take a jab at it, it's my own mess after all...
