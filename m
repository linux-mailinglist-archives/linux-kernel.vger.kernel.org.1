Just looked a bit more at this struct dc_state, and that looks a lot
like an atomic side-wagon. I don't think that works as a private
state, this should probably be embedded into a subclass of
drm_atomic_state.

And probably a lot of these pointers moved to other places I think, or
I'm not entirely clear on what exactly this stuff is needed for ...

dc_state is also refcounted, which is definitely rather funny for a
state structure.

Feels like this entire thing (how the overall dc state machinery is
glued into atomic) isn't quite thought thru just yet :-/
