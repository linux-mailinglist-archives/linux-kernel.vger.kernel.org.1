Yeah. My reasoning for is that it will take a while --at least one 
development cycle more-- to completely get rid of all the 0/1-arrays.
Also, this was motivated by the following comments from Christian
König:

"May I suggest that we add a section how to correctly do this to
Documentation/process/coding-style.rst or similar document?

I've seen a bunch of different approaches and some even doesn't work
with some gcc versions and result in a broken binary."[1]

I agree with this. I can add the comments in quotes you suggest to this
patch.

But I think we can add this note while I continue working on the flexible-array
conversions. Once that work is complete, I can go back and update the
documentation. :)

What do you think?

Thanks
