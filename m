Well the kernel seems to be the place a fix would be most effective.
Not like it's unusual for the kernel to work around hardware issues in
general. :P

So I'm having trouble coming up with a reliable way to fix this in userspace,
I've already got quite a few moving parts there as is and most of what I
come up with seems like it would not work reliably, at least for automatically
repairing the eeprom.

Yeah, it does seem a bit sketchy at first, I went with this approach mostly
since I couldn't think of a practical scenario where fixing it automatically
would be a real issue, assuming we can reliably detect the preimage
attack.

So maybe identify the preimage attack and log a message instead? From
my understanding false positives should be nearly impossible with the
signature identification technique I'm using.

Maybe we could expose an interface that triggers the eeprom repair,
one which doesn't require userspace to implement low level USB handling?
