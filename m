Hmmm, only interrupt would be terminate, so yes we should not do running
conditionally here..

yeah userspace is blocked on this call, till signalling for partial
drain is done. So it should work. But next_track 'should' be signalled
before this, but yes we need to recheck this logic here and ensure no
gaps are left in gapless :-)
