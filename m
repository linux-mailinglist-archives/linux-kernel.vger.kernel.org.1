It's fine. The binding has to be consistent on its own, but
doesn't dictate the way the driver does thing.

Rob will tell you that the kernel isn't a validation tool for broken
DTs. Shout if you want, but you are allowed to simply ignore the
output trigger for example

The output of a SIRQ should be compatible with the GIC input it is
attached to. You can have:

         device (LEVEL_LOW) -> SIRQ (LEVEL_HIGH) -> GIC

but you can't have:

         device (LEVEL_LOW) -> SIRQ (EDGE_RISING) -> GIC

because that's not an acceptable transformation for the SIRQ,
nor can you have:

         device (EDGE_FALLING) -> SIRQ (EDGE_FALLING) -> GIC

because EDGE_FALLING isn't a valid input for the GIC.

In both of the invalid cases, you would be free to apply
which ever transformation actually makes sense, and shout
at the user if you want to help them debugging their turf.
The later part is definitely optional.

Hope this helps,

         M.
