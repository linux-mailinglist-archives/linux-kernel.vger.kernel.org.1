Eric, with all due respect, Christian is not a sleeper agent of some
shadow Ubuntu kernel team that is tirelessly trying to slip things by
you. I have no idea where you could have possibly gotten this
impression, given his track record of the past few years.

I also don't understand why you feel the need to talk about things which
he had nothing to do with -- what relationship does the /etc/shadow
thing have to do with his work and track record? Were Debian kernel
contributors considered untrustworthy because of the OpenSSL weak keys
issue? Would it be fair to question your competence because some RHEL
kernel backports were borked? Of course not -- that would be ridiculous!

What gives you that impression? This whole thing seems incredibly
strange -- we've all met IRL several times, and have had many long
discussions about the best way to solve problems without placing undue
burden on kernel maintenance.

Furthermore, I don't think this is an acceptable way to talk about a
peer within the kernel community -- attributing malicious intent without
any justification other than "I feel this is the case" is little more
than a character assassination, and I don't see why you would feel that
such a statement is justified.
