Interesting. My thinking around --follow was that it's like
--full-history in the sense that it won't prune history, but it would
also keep listing history beyond file renames.

The --follow functionality is quite useful when looking at older
branches and trying to understand where changes should go into on those
older branches.

We also do have some notion of "file identity" in the kernel; it's
prevalent with "quirk files". Look at these for example:

  - drivers/mmc/core/quirks.h
  - sound/pci/hda/patch_*.c
  - drivers/hid/hid-quirks.c

We know that patches to those files are likely to contain quirks (which
we usually want to take into the Stable branches) so I might have a
script that monitors a list of these "special" files in which case I
need to see a complete list of commits that went into those files.
