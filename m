release_task() should only be called once per thread otherwise we'd have
big problems. And every time we call release_task() we're already
EXIT_DEAD iirc. So there should be no way someone else can find us (in a
relevant way and especially not from userspace).
exit_notify() -> if we're autoreaping we're EXIT_DEAD anyway, if we're
not autoreaping we'll wait_task_zombie() eventually -> we're EXIT_DEAD
(parent has reaped us)

find_child_reaper() -> we couldn't find a child reaper for us, i.e. we
were (namespace) init -> unlink all tasks we were ptracing
(exit_ptrace()) and if they're EXIT_DEAD move them to the dead list ->
release_task()'s that are EXIT_DEAD that we ptraced.

and de_thread() relies on EXIT_DEAD too:
/*
 * We are going to release_task()->ptrace_unlink() silently,
 * the tracer can sleep in do_wait(). EXIT_DEAD guarantees
 * the tracer wont't block again waiting for this thread.
*/

(This is a very _rough_ sketch.)
So I think that's safe.
