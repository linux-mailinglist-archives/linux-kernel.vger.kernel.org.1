 ATN:PLEASE/ I AM Mr Mohammad Z. Raqab
Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is
not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. This letter must ,
come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that
people meet and become great friends and business partners.

Please I want you to read this letter very carefully and I must
apologize for barging this message into your mail box without any
formal introduction due to the urgency and confidentiality of this
business and I know that this message will come to you as a surprise.
Please, this is not a joke and I will not like you to joke with it OK,
With due respect to your person and much sincerity of purpose, I make
this contact with you as I believe that you can be of great
assistance,  to me. My name is Mr Mohammad Z. Raqab, from Burkina
Faso, West Africa. I
work in Bank  as telex manager, please see this as a confidential
message and do  not reveal it to another person, and let me know
whether you can be of assistance regarding my proposal  below because
it is top secret.

I am about to retire from active Banking service to start a new life ,
but I am skeptical to reveal this particular secret to a stranger.
You must assure me that everything will be handled confidentially
because we are not going to suffer again in life. It has been 10 years
now that most of the greedy African Politicians used our bank to
launder,  money overseas through the help of their Political

advisers.  Most of the funds which they transferred out of the shores
of Africa were gold
and oil money that was supposed to have been used to develop the
continent. Their Political advisers always inflated the amounts before
transferring to foreign accounts,  so I also used the opportunity to
divert part of the funds hence I am aware that there is no official
trace of

how much was transferred as all the accounts used for such  transfers
were being closed after transfer.  I acted as the Bank Officer to most
of the politicians and when I discovered that they
were using me to succeed in their greedy act;  I also cleaned some of
their banking records from the Bank files and no one cared to ask me
because the money was too much for them to control,  They laundered
over $5billion Dollars during the process. Before I send this message
to you,  I have already diverted ($10.5million Dollars) to an escrow
account belonging to no one in the bank. The bank is anxious now to
know who the beneficiary to the funds is because

they have made a lot of profits with the funds. It is more than Eight
years now and most of the politicians are no longer using our bank to
transfer funds overseas. The ($10.5million Dollars) has been laying
waste in our bank and I don't want to retire from the bank without
transferring the funds to a foreign account to enable me share the
proceeds with the receiver (a foreigner).
The money will be shared 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no one
coming to ask you about the funds because I secured everything. I only
want you to assist me by providing a reliable bank account where the
funds can be transferred. You are not to face any difficulties or
legal implications as I am going to handle the transfer personally. If
you are capable of receiving the funds,  do let me know immediately to
enable me give you a detailed

information on what to do.  For me,  I have not stolen the money from
anyone because the other people that took the whole money did not face
any problems.  This is my chance to grab my own life opportunity but
you must keep the details of the funds secret to avoid any leakages as
no one in the bank knows about my plans.  Please get back to me if you
are interested and capable to handle this project,  I shall intimate
you on what to do when I hear from your confirmation and acceptance.
If you are capable of being my trusted associate,do declare your
consent to me, I am looking forward to hear from you immediately for
further information,
