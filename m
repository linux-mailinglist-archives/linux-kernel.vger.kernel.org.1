I assume the MR you were talking about is
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/3724 ? I am
also aware of the tegra driver being broken on my jetson nano and I am
now curious if this MR could fix this bug as well... and sorry for the
harsh reply, I was just a annoyed by the fact that "everything
modifier related is just breaking things", first tegra and that nobody
is looking into fixing it and then apparently the userspace code being
quite broken as well :/

Anyway, yeah I trust you guys on figuring out the keeping "broken"
userspace happy from a kernel side and maybe I can help out with
reviewing the mesa bits. I am just wondering if it could help with the
tegra situation giving me more reasons to look into it as this would
solve other issues I should be working on :)
