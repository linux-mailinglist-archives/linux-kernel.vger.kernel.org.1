The memory consumption is predominantely in slab (unreclaimable). Only
~8% of the memory is on LRUs (anonymous + file). Slab (both reclaimable
and unreclaimable) is ~40%. So there is still a lot of memory
unaccounted (direct users of the page allocator). This would partially
explain why the oom killer is not able to make progress and eventually
panics because it is the kernel which is blowing the memory consumption.

There is still ~1G free memory but the problem is that this is a
GFP_KERNEL request which is not allowed to consume Movable memory.
Zone normal is depleted and therefore it cannot satisfy this request
even when there are some order-1 pages available.

I do not see the state of swap in the oom splat so I assume you have
swap disabled. If that is the case then the memory reclaim cannot really
do much for this request. There is almost no page cache to reclaim.

That being said I do not see how a increased min_free_kbytes could help
for this particular OOM situation. If there is really any relation it is
more of a unintended side effect.

Define incorrect. What are the actual values? Have you tried to increase
the value manually after the hotplug?
