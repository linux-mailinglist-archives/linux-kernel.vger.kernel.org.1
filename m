That is definitely one of the motivations for these events here.

Agreed, the events are low level and follows the implementation very
closely. Hence posted as a RFC instead, as I was not very sure about

Will also add another THP_PMD_MIGRATION_FAILURE even in migrate_pages()
when a huge page could not be allocated and THP gets split.
