Hmm, I think that conflates two things though because only the partitions
managed by KVM will have DT nodes.

Yes, but that all happens as part of KVM initialisation: the host parses
the DT nodes and memory reservations, and then passes this information
up to EL2.

It has to do this, regardless of how they are probed. Once KVM has
initialised, the host will have a stage-2 which limits it to the memory that
it is allowed to access.

I think you're trying too hard to separate the host from the EL2 code during
early boot. Don't forget -- this is all part of the same binary payload that
is loaded and initially run at EL2. Having the host take care of early boot
/significantly/ reduces the amount of code at EL2, which has a very
clear security benefit.
