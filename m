That wasn't the conclusion when we discussed this last time on IRC.
+Nicolas Dufresne

Currently the 1-slice per buffer model is quite impractical:
1) the maximum number of buffers is 32, which for some streams can be
less than needed to queue a single frame,
2) even more system call overhead due to the need to repeat various
operations (e.g. qbuf/dqbuf) per-slice rather than per-frame,
3) no way to do hardware batching for hardware which supports queuing
multiple slices at a time,
4) waste of memory - one needs to allocate all the OUTPUT buffers
pessimistically to accommodate the biggest possible slice, while with
all-slices-per-frame 1 buffer could be just heuristically allocated to
be enough for the whole frame.

These need to be carefully evaluated, with some proper testing done to
confirm whether they are really a problem or not.

These fields need to be specified for each slice in the buffer to make
it possible to handle multiple slices per buffer.
