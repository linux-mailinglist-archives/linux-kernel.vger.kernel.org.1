reg_vdd_cpu_gpu has 

    regulator-min-microvolt = <1135000>;
    regulator-max-microvolt = <1135000>;

top OPP is:

    opp@1800000000 {
            clock-latency-ns = <244144>; /* 8 32k periods */
            opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <1800000000>;

            opp-microvolt-speed0 = <1160000>;
            opp-microvolt-speed1 = <1100000>;
            opp-microvolt-speed2 = <1100000>;
    };

So I guess ignoring the voltage and not disabling this OPP may or may not work
based on SoC bin.

On Orange Pi One, there's a regulator that supports two voltages (that can't
support all the listed OPPs for H3), and cpufreq-dt can deal with that
automagically, if you specify OPP voltages via a tripplet of [prefered min max].
Kernell will log this in dmesg on boot:

[    0.672440] core: _opp_supported_by_regulators: OPP minuV: 1320000 maxuV: 1320000, not supported by regulator
[    0.672454] cpu cpu0: _opp_add: OPP not supported by regulators (1104000000)
[    0.672523] core: _opp_supported_by_regulators: OPP minuV: 1320000 maxuV: 1320000, not supported by regulator
[    0.672530] cpu cpu0: _opp_add: OPP not supported by regulators (1200000000)
[    0.672621] core: _opp_supported_by_regulators: OPP minuV: 1340000 maxuV: 1340000, not supported by regulator
[    0.672628] cpu cpu0: _opp_add: OPP not supported by regulators (1296000000)
[    0.672712] core: _opp_supported_by_regulators: OPP minuV: 1400000 maxuV: 1400000, not supported by regulator
[    0.672719] cpu cpu0: _opp_add: OPP not supported by regulators (1368000000)

And the list of available OPPs will be reduced at runtime to a supportable
set by the CPU regulator.

If you look at:

  https://megous.com/git/linux/commit/?h=ths-5.7&id=d231770195913cf543c0cf9539deee2ecec06680

you'll see a bunch of OPPs for H3 that are specified as a range. So
for example if you want 480MHz, and your regulator can't produce
1.04V exactly, cpufreq will set the voltage to something supportable
in the range.

I think the proper fix is to fix the OPP table for H6, so that it uses
voltage ranges for each OPP and not a single fixed voltage, to support
boards that don't have the standard PMIC that goes with H6.

	o.
