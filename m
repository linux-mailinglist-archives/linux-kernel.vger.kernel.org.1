I experimented a bit more, and the below patch seems to solve the
warnings. However, that was based on your pointer about kvm_wait(), and
I can't quite tell if it is the right solution.

My hypothesis here is simply that kvm_wait() may be called in a place
where we get the same case I mentioned to Peter,

	raw_local_irq_save(); /* or other IRQs off without tracing */
	...
	kvm_wait() /* IRQ state tracing gets confused */
	...
	raw_local_irq_restore();

and therefore, using raw variants in kvm_wait() works. It's also safe
because it doesn't call any other libraries that would result in corrupt
IRQ state AFAIK.

Thanks,
