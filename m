As noted by Dietmar, I forgot to mention loosing RR in the changelog,
bad me.

In this case I'm not actually 100% sure, but there was no comment with
it that justified it being RR, and RR-SMP is not optimal (in fact it's
rather buggered).

In general RR is even more 'interesting' to get right thatn FIFO and
therefore I figured it probably didn't want to be RR, but given there
can be multiple of such threads, it might have been an attempt at
providing some sort of fairness between the multiple threads.

At the same time, if you're running the threads so hard that RR makes a
difference, it's unlikely there is any actual NORMAL time left and
things will be unhappy anyway.

Therefore, and me being lazy, make it FIFO.
