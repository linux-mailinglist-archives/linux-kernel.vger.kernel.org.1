For Clang we have an option ("-mllvm
-tsan-instrument-func-entry-exit=0"), for GCC, I don't think we have
the option.

I had hoped we could keep these compiler changes optional for now, to
not require a very recent compiler. I'll send a patch to enable the
option, but keep it optional for now. Or do you think we require the
compiler to support this? Because then we'll only support Clang.

That point is fair enough. But how do we fix arch_atomic_{read,set} then?

Thanks,
