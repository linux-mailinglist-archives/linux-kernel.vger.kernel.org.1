Thanks John. I was planning on digging up the context for GKI and then
replying. Looks like you are better at finding that than me :)

And I was also going to suggest the same "permanent" module option and
also setting up the driver attributes (bind something?) so that the
driver can't be unbound from the device either.

Marc, does that answer your questions? Sorry for not giving enough
context in my original email.
