Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] Add support for MaxLinear/Exar USB to serial converters
Date:   Thu, 30 Apr 2020 10:06:34 +0530

From: Manivannan Sadhasivam <mani@kernel.org>

Hello,

This series adds support for MaxLinear/Exar USB to serial converters.
This driver only supports XR21V141X series but provision has been made
to support other series in future.

This driver is inspired from the initial one submitted by Patong Yang:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10543261/

While the initial driver was a custom tty USB driver exposing whole
new serial interface ttyXRUSBn, this version is completely based on USB
serial core thus exposing the interfaces as ttyUSBn. This will avoid
the overhead of exposing a new USB serial interface which the userspace
tools are unaware of.

This series has been tested with Hikey970 board hosting XR21V141X chip.

Thanks,
Mani

Changes in v2:

* Dropped the code related to handling variable register size. It's all u8 now.
* Dropped the header file and moved the contents to driver itself.
* Added Linus's reviewed-by tag for gpiochip patch.
* Added PID to gpiochip label
* Dropped gpiochip for interface 0
