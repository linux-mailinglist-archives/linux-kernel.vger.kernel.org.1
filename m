No, that's not what I'm talking about. I meant:

1. Device A is assigned a default init address X in the DT.
2. Device B has no init address
3. The framework reserves address X for and assigns it to device A
   when it appears on the bus (DAA, SETDASA or HJ+DDA)
4. Device B is assigned address Y
5. User decides to explicitly assign a different address to device A by
   issuing "echo Z > /sys/bus/i3c/..../<i3c-dev>/dyn_addr" (not yet
   supported, but I think we should allow that at some point), such
   that device A gets a lower/higher priority
6. User manually assigns address X to device B (that should be allowed
   since device A no longer uses X)
7. Device A is reset for some reason and loses its dynamic address,
   thus requiring a new DAA (or HJ+DAA). During this new discovery,
   device A is re-assigned its last known address (Z), but in the
   meantime you've marked address X as free (when attaching boardinfo
   to the newdev object).

If we go for a temporary solution, I'd opt for relaxing the test done
in i3c_master_get_i3c_addrs() to not reserve the init address (since it
should have been reserved at probe time) and keep those init addressed
reserved.
