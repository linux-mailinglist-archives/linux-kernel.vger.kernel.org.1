Just to clarify here, are you talking about acquire on atomic RMW operations
being different to non-RMW operations, or are you talking about
atomic_read_acquire() being different to smp_load_acquire() (which I don't
think is the case, but wanted to check)?

We need to write this stuff down.

I'm not sure I really see the benefit of the rename, to be honest with you,
especially if smp_mb__after_spinlock() doesn't disappear at the same time.
The only reason you'd use this barrier is because the atomic is hidden away
behind a locking API, otherwise you'd just have used the full-barrier variant
of the atomic op to start with, wouldn't you?
