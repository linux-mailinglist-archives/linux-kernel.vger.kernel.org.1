It does not make sense to mention 37f4a24c2469, which is reverted in
4e2f62e566b5. Later the patch in 37f4a24c2469 is fixed and re-commited
as 568f27006577.

However, I can _not_ reproduce the issue by running the same test on
kernel built from 568f27006577 directly.

Also you have confirmed that the issue can't be fixed after reverting
568f27006577 against v5.9-rc4.

Looks the real issue(slab list corruption) should be introduced between
568f27006577 and v5.9-rc4.


thanks,
