Yes, the specific features are the APIs:
- bind guest PASID
- cache invalidation
- page requests & response

I guess capability chain is more suitable since the IOCTL uses
container FD instead of device FD in VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE?

We can give that a try by treating IOMMU UAPIs as capabilities. That
would address problem #1. We really need to check compatibility upfront
in that there is no way to fail some of the UAPIs. e.g. unbind guest
PASID, cache invalidation.

Currently we already have individual version & flags per UAPI data. The
reason why I introduced a global/unifier is to simplify the
compatibility checking. Global version is optional.
With individual version & flags, user may have to keep track of
combinations of per structure versions.

Yes, this is why I was hoping to stick with the rule: open for
extension, closed to modification.
It also makes the code backward compatible easy since there old code
would have no change when adding new features.

I agree. I feel we can use the capability chain at container level as
you mentioned, right?

I like the latter as well.

So, __user * will be passed to IOMMU driver if VFIO checks minsz
include flags and they are valid.
IOMMU driver can copy the rest based on the mandatory version/minsz and
flags in the IOMMU uAPI structs.
Does it sound right? This is really choice #2.

Per structure version & flags is what we have in the mainline. It
applies to both choice 1 & 2. The global/unified version is just a
re-interpretation of the versions such that we have a monolithic
incrementing version. Again, global version is optional.

I will leave that to Christoph :)
