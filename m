True, but we also didn't have any calls to call_rcu() prior to the call
to rcu_init() until suddenly we did.  (Yeah, I could have put my foot
down and prohibited that practice, but the workarounds were quite a bit
more complicated than just making call_rcu() work during very early boot.)

And last I checked, there really were calls to call_rcu() under raw
spinlocks, so the potential or calls to double-argument kfree_rcu()
clearly exists and is very real.

OK, that is reassuring.  Here is hoping!

							Thanx, Paul
