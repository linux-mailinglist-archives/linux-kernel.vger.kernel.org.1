That's what I had in mind. Maybe you'll have to use
dev->of_node->parent though, I think they are not equivalent.

This means the regmap has already been initialized, can you make sure
it is actually the case? What if the probe of the EBI block happens
next, or is deferred? (maybe you'll get a -EPROBE_DEFER, which is fine
then). Please try booting with the EBI node but without the EBI driver
and see if this is handled gracefully.
