Good thing about command line parameters are that they are optional, 
they do
not specify any default behaviour (I mean they are not mandatory to be 
set
for the system to be functional), so I would like to view it as an 
optional
config. And this command line parameter (nonstrict_device) is strictly 
optional
with default being strict already set in the driver.

They can be passed from the bootloader via chosen node for DT platforms 
or choose
a new *bootconfig* as a way to pass the cmdline but finally it does boil 
down to
just another config.

I agree with general boolean or single value command line parameters 
being just
more messy which could just be Kconfigs instead but for multiple value 
parameters
like these do not fit in Kconfig.

As you might already know, command line also gives an advantage to the 
end user
to configure system without building kernel, for this specific command 
line its
very useful because the performance bump is quite noticeable when the 
iommu.strict
is off. Now for end user who would not be interested in building entire 
kernel(majority)
and just cares about good speeds or throughput can find this very 
beneficial.
I am not talking about one specific OS usecase here but more in general 
term.

Is the universal solution here referring to fix all the command line 
parameters
in the kernel or this specific command line? Are we going to remove any 
more
addition to the cmdline ;)

So possible other solution is the *bootconfig* which is again just 
another place
to look for a config. So thing is that this universal solution would 
result in
just more new fancy ways of passing configs or adding such configs to 
the drivers
or subsystems in kernel which is pretty much similar to implementing 
policy in
kernel which I think is frowned upon and mentioned in the other thread.

How is tagging in driver or device tree better than the simple command 
line
approach to pass the same list of devices which otherwise you would 
hardcode
in the corresponding drivers and device tree all over the kernel other 
than
the scalability part for command line? IMHO it is too much churn.

Device tree could be used but then we have a problem with it being for 
only
describing hardware and it doesn't work for ACPI based systems.

Command line approach works for all systems (both DT and ACPI) without 
having
to add too much churn to drivers. Lastly, I think we can have both 
options, it
doesn't hurt to add command line parameter since it is optional.

Thanks,
Sai
