Ah, that makes more sense. The way it was worded didn't quite put 2 and
2 together like that.

OK, I'm still missing something, but having a hard time explaining
exactly what that is. ;-)

I guess that is, why did moving the initialization early require an
allocation where initializing it later did not? What allocation are we
avoiding?

I'm not seeing why this trick is needed when we moved the init early as
compared to doing the same thing later on.

Is it this?

We want to avoid calling kzalloc() early?

If so, this should have a comment here stating so and why.
