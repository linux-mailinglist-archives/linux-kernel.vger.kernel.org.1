FLATMEM is useful for UMA systems with a single memory bank, so probably
it's worth keeping it for low end machines.

Non-vmemmap sparsemem is essentially disable in arch/arm64/Kconfig, so
for NUMA configurations SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP is the only choice.

Moreover if we reduce SECTION_SIZE_BITS, we can drop
free_unused_memmap() and since the arm64 memory map for sparse will not
differ from other arches we can drop custom pfn_valid() as well.
