The original intent was that watermark checks were expensive as some of the
calculations are only necessary when a zone is relatively low on memory
and the check does not always have to be 100% accurate. This is probably
still true given that __zone_watermark_ok() makes a number of calculations
depending on alloc flags even if a zone is almost completely free.
