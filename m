Subject: ext4 regression in v5.9-rc2 from e7bfb5c9bb3d on ro fs with

Ran into an ext4 regression when testing upgrades to 5.9-rc kernels:

Commit e7bfb5c9bb3d ("ext4: handle add_system_zone() failure in
ext4_setup_system_zone()") breaks mounting of read-only ext4 filesystems
with intentionally overlapping bitmap blocks.

On an always-read-only filesystem explicitly marked with
EXT4_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_SHARED_BLOCKS, prior to that commit, it's safe to
point all the block and inode bitmaps to a single block of all 1s,
because a read-only filesystem will never allocate or free any blocks or
inodes.

However, after that commit, the block validity check rejects such
filesystems with -EUCLEAN and "failed to initialize system zone (-117)".
This causes systems that previously worked correctly to fail when
upgrading to v5.9-rc2 or later.

This was obviously a bugfix, and I'm not suggesting that it should be
reverted; it looks like this effectively worked by accident before,
because the block_validity check wasn't fully functional. However, this
does break real systems, and I'd like to get some kind of regression fix
in before 5.9 final if possible. I think it would suffice to make
block_validity default to false if and only if
EXT4_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_SHARED_BLOCKS is set.

Does that seem like a reasonable fix?

Here's a quick sketch of a patch, which I've tested and confirmed to
work:

Subject: [PATCH] Fix ext4 regression in v5.9-rc2 on ro fs with overlapped bitmaps

Commit e7bfb5c9bb3d ("ext4: handle add_system_zone() failure in
ext4_setup_system_zone()") breaks mounting of read-only ext4 filesystems
with intentionally overlapping bitmap blocks.

On an always-read-only filesystem explicitly marked with
EXT4_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_SHARED_BLOCKS, prior to that commit, it's safe to
point all the block and inode bitmaps to a single block of all 1s,
because a read-only filesystem will never allocate or free any blocks or

However, after that commit, the block validity check rejects such
filesystems with -EUCLEAN and "failed to initialize system zone (-117)".
This causes systems that previously worked correctly to fail when
upgrading to v5.9-rc2 or later.

Fix this by defaulting block_validity to off when
EXT4_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_SHARED_BLOCKS is set.
