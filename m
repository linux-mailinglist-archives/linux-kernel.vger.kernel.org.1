Good to hear!  ;-)

Here both functions would say "true" for a pointer from kmalloc()?
Or do I need to add a third function that is happy with a pointer from
either source?

I do understand that people who don't want to distinguish could just do
"kmem_cache_valid_ptr(p) || kmalloc_valid_ptr(p)".  However, the two
use cases in the series have no idea whether the pointer they have came
from kmalloc(), kmem_cache_alloc(), or somewhere else entirely, even an
on-stack variable.

Are you asking me to choose between the _obj() and _ptr() suffixes?
If not, please help me understand the distinction.

Do we want "debug" in these names as well?

I am quite happy to add the "debug", but my use cases have no idea
how the pointer was allocated.  In fact, the next version of the
patch will also handle allocator return addresses from vmalloc().

And for kernels without sufficient debug enabled, I need to provide
the name of the slab cache, and this also is to be in the next version.

Agreed, in fact, I was planning to have a function that printed out
a suitable error-message continuation to the console for ease-of-use
reasons.  For example, why is the caller deciding how deep the stack
frame is?  ;-)

So something like this?

	void kmalloc_debug_print_provenance(void *ptr);

With the understanding that it will print something helpful regardless
of where ptr came from, within the constraints of the kernel build and
boot options?

							Thanx, Paul
