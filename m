I experimented a bit with your diff, but it turned out that moving the
page-table allocation functions/macros to asm-generic/pgalloc.h does not
work on all architectures.

The reason is that some archs don't use that header at all (e.g. ARC)
and have their own version of the functions defined there. That could
all be made working, but I decided to no open this can of worms for now.

So I sent out a patch which moves the p?d_alloc_track() functions/macros
to a separate header and include it only in mm/vmalloc.c and
lib/ioremap.c. That compiles on all architectures where current Linus'
master also builds (it does not for Alpha, CSky, Mips and Mips64), and
as usual Hexagon and Unicore32 are not tested because I have no working
compiler for those.

Regards,

	Joerg
