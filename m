Pending debug exceptions should just go in the pending debug
exceptions field. End of story and end of complications. I don't
understand why kvm is so averse to using this field the way it was
intended.

As for the MTF, section 34.14.1 of the SDM, volume 3, clearly states:

The pseudocode above makes reference to the saving of VMX-critical
state. This state consists of the following:
(1) SS.DPL (the current privilege level); (2) RFLAGS.VM; (3) the state
of blocking by STI and by MOV SS (see
Table 24-3 in Section 24.4.2); (4) the state of virtual-NMI blocking
(only if the processor is in VMX non-root oper-
ation and the =E2=80=9Cvirtual NMIs=E2=80=9D VM-execution control is 1); an=
d (5) an
indication of whether an MTF VM exit is pending
(see Section 25.5.2). These data may be saved internal to the
processor or in the VMCS region of the current
VMCS. Processors that do not support SMI recognition while there is
blocking by STI or by MOV SS need not save
the state of such blocking.

I haven't really looked at kvm's implementation of SMM (because Google
doesn't support it), but it seems that the "MTF VM exit is pending"
bit should be trivial to deal with. I assume we save the other
VMX-critical state somewhere!
