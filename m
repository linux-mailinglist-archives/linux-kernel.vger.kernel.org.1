Jacky / Abel,

Any movement on this? As I see it the lack of imx8mm power-domain
support in the kernel is holding up USB, PCIe, VPU, and perhaps
GPU/CSI as well. I would tend to agree that hiding this functionality
in the TF-A is probably not the best approach especially as that
requires a NXP version of the TF-A. I really don't see the issue with
the gpc driver getting a little more complicated if it needs to. There
is bound to be some complication as there is such a large variation of
IMX8 products out there! (talk about confusing!).

Best Regards,

Tim
