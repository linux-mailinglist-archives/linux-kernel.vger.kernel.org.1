No, you are thinking about this all wrong.

ALL contributors make mistakes, you should not be treating anyone
different from anyone else.  I think I probably have contributed more
bugs than many contributors, does that make me a "malicious"
contributor?  Or just someone who contributes a lot?

So checking on patches needs to be done for everyone, right?

We have an idea of "trust" in kernel development, it's how we work so
well.  I don't trust people not that they will always get things
"correct", but rather that they will be around to fix it when they get
it "wrong", as everyone makes mistakes, we are all human.

So we trust people who we accept pull requests from, we don't review
their contributions because we trust that they did, and again, they will
fix it when it goes wrong.

We do both today quite well, why do you think this is not the case?

We use lots, everything we do is in the open, I suggest doing some
research first please.

Since when does code coverage actually matter as a viable metric?

Look at the tools we use, again, it's all in the open, and tell us what
we could be doing differently by offering to help us implement those
tools into our workflows.  That would be the best way to contribute
here, don't you agree?

thanks,
