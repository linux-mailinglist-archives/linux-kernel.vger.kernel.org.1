One more counter-argument I thought of after sending my response. If the 
samples for the previous track and the next track are not generated by 
the *same* filterbank, then you would lose the implicit averaging 
between tracks performed by the filterbank (usually an inverse MDCT), 
which will likely result in sample discontinuities and pop noise on 
transitions. If we have different filterbanks we should really look into 
explicit cross-fading which is a much larger change than what this patch 
suggests.
