I'm struck that all references here are to code that does not run in
kernel space. Frankly on LKML I don't know if we should even *care* what
format UUIDs are stored in other address spaces.

We care about is the endianness of the UUID on the interface boundaries
into and out of the kernel[1] and we care that we use the correct kernel
type to describe it.

I understood from Jerome's post that the UUID that the kernel
manipulates are, in fact, big endian and that they should be called
uuid_t.

Is there more going on here or is that it?


Daniel.


[1] I guess we'd also like those interface boundaries to be reasonably
    sane but if they already exist and are the interface is consistent
    about endianness then I find it hard to see no reason for a
    gratuitous endianness change.
