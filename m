I don't think this will work. E.g. the patch would prevent tick
preemption between 'A' and 'n0' on '/' as well

You also have to make sure that a SCHED_IDLE task can tick preempt
another SCHED_IDLE task.

Because of this very small weight (weight=3), compared to a SCHED_NORMAL
nice 0 task (weight=1024), a SCHED_IDLE task is penalized by a huge
se->vruntime value (1024/3 higher than for a SCHED_NORMAL nice 0 task).
This should make sure it doesn't tick preempt a SCHED_NORMAL nice 0 task.

It's different when the SCHED_NORMAL task has nice 19 (weight=15) but
that's part of the CFS design.

Yeah, leave this for the rq->idle task (swapper/X).

Understood. But this (tick) preemption should happen extremely rarely,
especially if you have SCHED_NORMAL nice 0 tasks, right?
