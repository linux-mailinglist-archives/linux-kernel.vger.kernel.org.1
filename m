Agree. As I replied to Keith, I am just interested in enabling the ZNS
models that come with append disabled.

I understand that you want vendor alignment in the NVMe driver and I
agree. We are not pushing for a non-append model - you can see that we
are investing effort in implementing the append path in thee block layer
and io_uring and we will continue doing so as patches get merged.

This said, we do have some OEM models that do not implement append and I
would like them to be supported in Linux. As you know, new TPs are being
standardized now and the append emulation is the based for adding
support for this. I do not believe it is unreasonable to find a way to
add support for this SSDs.

If you completely close the door this approach, the alternative is
carrying off-tree patches to the several OEMs that use these devices.
This is not good for the zoned ecosystem nor for the future of Zone
Append.

Are you open to us doing some characterization and if the impact
to the fast path is not significant, moving ahead to a Zone Append
emulation like in SCSI? I will promise that we will remove this path if
requests for these devices terminate.
