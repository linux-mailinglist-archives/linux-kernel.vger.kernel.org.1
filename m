Do we see this to be a practical problem? I am really confused because
the initial argument was revolving around an optimization now you are
suggesting that this is actually system stability measure. And I fail to
see how allowing an easy way to deplete pcp caches completely solves
any of that. Please do realize that if allow that then every user who
relies on pcp caches will have to take a slow(er) path and that will
have performance consequences. The pool is a global and a scarce
resource. That's why I've suggested a dedicated preallocated pool and
use it instead of draining global pcp caches.

OK, I have certainly noticed that one but didn't react but my response
would be similar to the dedicated gfp flag. This is less of a hack than
__GFP_NOLOCK  but it still exposes very internal parts of the allocator
and I find that a quite problematic from the future maintenance of the
allocator. The risk of an easy depletion of the pcp pool is also there
of course.
