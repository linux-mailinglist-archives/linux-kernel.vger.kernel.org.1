Sure, I will try to follow your suggestion. But I think it's better to
first generalize the base IPI allocation scheme.

I think what you are looking for here is something that could be
sufficed via enabling "CONFIG_GENERIC_IRQ_IPI" framework for arm64/arm
architectures. It's currently used for mips architecture. Looking at
its implementation, I think it should be possible to hook up SGIs
under new IPI irq_domain for GICv2/v3.

So with this framework we should be able to dynamically allocate IPIs
and use common APIs such as request_irq()/request_nmi() to tell IPI
specific handlers.

If this approach looks sane to you then I can start working on a PoC
implementation for arm64.

Yeah that was mine understanding as well. But I was just clarifying if
you have any further use-cases in mind for IPIs.
