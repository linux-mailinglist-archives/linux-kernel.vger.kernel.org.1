Subject: [PATCH v3 00/12] Initial MStar/Sigmastar Armv7 SoC support

This patch set adds initial support for MStar/Sigmastar's
Armv7 based SoCs. There is just enough here to get to a shell
with an initramfs but support for a lot of the hardware is
in progress and will follow.

MStar also shipped chips with MIPS cores and ARM9 etc which
are incompatible so I've tried to make the distinction in the
code that this is strictly for the Armv7 based chips.

Differences from v2:

1. With Marc Zyngier's help the GIC node has been filled out properly.

2. A comment was added to the arch timer node to explain why the
clock-frequency is specified. Basically the vendor u-boot is old and
broken.

3. Based on Arnd Bergmann's feedback the heavy memory barrier is now
implemented using a DT node to specify where the registers are instead
of hardcoding their location. A binding description has been added for
the new node.

4. Expanded comments around the heavy memory barrier code so it's more
obvious why it looks like it does.

5. The heavy memory barrier init code was folded into the machine init
function.

6. Updated the device tree bindings and prefixes based on Andreas Färber's
feedback. They have also been split out into a number of commits

7. Based on Andreas Färber's feedback I've added the "riu" (register interface
unit) internal bus that contains all of the peripheral registers and the proper
ranges for the soc node. This bus has clocks, interrupts and some configuration
register so it might get it's own driver in the future.

8. I've dropped the pmu node for now as it's not needed to boot and I'm not
sure of the relationship between the single core in most of the chips and
the 4 documented interrupts.

9. Numerous cosmetic changes based on Andreas Färber's feedback.

Differences from v1:

1. v1 only really supported two specific chips that were known
at the time of submitting that patch series. Since then it's
become apparent that there are a few families of SoCs based
on the same ARMv7 core, clk blocks, interrupt controllers etc
and this v2 attempts to make support more generic so in the future
more SoCs from this lineage can be added. Support for some other
chips is already in progress and will follow.

2. v1 only added support for the BreadBee boards that I have been
working on. v2 also adds support for a readily available car dash
camera.

3. Support for the BreadBee board has been split into two top level
dts to cleanly support if either the msc313 or msc313e is mounted on
the board. The chips are pin compatible but some of the internal
hardware is different. The u-boot port for these SoCs can detect
which chip it is running on and select the right dts so the user
doesn't have to care which chip is mounted on their board.
