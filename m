After some consideration, I decided that it will be better to start easy
by supporting the minimum needed for the rotation property to work on
Tegra, i.e. having userspace to take care of the rotation. It will be
possible to change it later on if will be necessary.

@dbasehore, I'll prepare Tegra DRM patchset around Monday and will
include yours two patches that add DT reading helper and set the display
info, since these patches haven't been applied yet.
