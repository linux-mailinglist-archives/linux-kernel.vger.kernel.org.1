Actually what I was more concerned with was the pointer chase that
required the RCU lock. With this function we are able to compare a
pair of pointers from the page and the lruvec and avoid the need for
the RCU lock. The way the old code was working we had to crawl through
the memcg to get to the lruvec before we could compare it to the one
we currently hold. The general idea is to use the data we have instead
of having to pull in some additional cache lines to perform the test.

My concern is that we have scenarios where isolate_migratepages_block
could possibly prevent another page from being able to isolate a page.
I'm mostly concerned with us potentially creating something like an
isolation leak if multiple threads are doing something like clearing
and then resetting the LRU flag. In my mind if we clear the LRU flag
we should be certain we are going to remove the page as otherwise
another thread would have done it if it would have been allowed
access.

I'm not looking for assurances, just sanity checks to make sure I am
not missing something obvious.

My concern ends up being that if we are clearing the bit and restoring
it while holding the LRU lock we can effectively cause pages to become
pseudo-pinned on the LRU. In my mind I would want us to avoid clearing
the LRU flag until we know we are going to be pulling the page from
the list once we take the lruvec lock. I interpret clearing of the
flag to indicate the page has already been pulled, it just hasn't left
the list yet. With us resetting the bit we are violating that which I
worry will lead to issues.
