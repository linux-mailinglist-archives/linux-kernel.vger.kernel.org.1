Note that an 'allyesconfig' selects KASAN and not KCSAN by default.
But I think that's not relevant, since KCSAN-specific code was removed
from ONCEs. In general though, it is entirely expected that we have a
bit longer compile times when we have the instrumentation passes
enabled.

But as you pointed out, that's irrelevant, and the significant
overhead is from parsing and pre-processing. FWIW, we can probably
optimize Clang itself a bit:
