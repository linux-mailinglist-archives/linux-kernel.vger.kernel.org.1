+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Hardware tag-based KASAN is similar to the software mode in concept, but uses
+hardware memory tagging support instead of compiler instrumentation and
+shadow memory.
+
+Hardware tag-based KASAN is currently only implemented for arm64 architecture
+and based on both arm64 Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) introduced in ARMv8.5
+Instruction Set Architecture, and Top Byte Ignore (TBI).

+Special arm64 instructions are used to assign memory tags for each allocation.
