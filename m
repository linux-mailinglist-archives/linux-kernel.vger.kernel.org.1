But the lock is not held during the migration, right?

Do I remember correctly that this can cause an allocation failure due to
overcommit check? In other words it would be user space visible thing?

I have managed to forgot all the juicy details since I have made that
change. All that remains is that the surplus pages accounting was quite
tricky and back then I didn't figure out a simpler method that would
achieve the consistent look at those counters. As mentioned above I
suspect this could lead to pre-mature allocation failures while the
migration is ongoing. Sure quite unlikely to happen and the race window
is likely very small. Maybe this is even acceptable but I would strongly
recommend to have all this thinking documented in the changelog.
