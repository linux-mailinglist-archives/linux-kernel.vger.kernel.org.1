For the klte, without this delay rpm init patch, the device reboots soon
after being booted. I tested with pure v5.8 and next-20200701 (both have
basic klte support, including usb ethernet for ssh). With the patch
applied, it works like a charm.

Note that there is no GPU enabled in this setup (unless I'm missing some
piece from the SOC dtsi).

If the IOMMU is only used for graphics, then the problem remains for klte.

I'll be happy to help with that.
