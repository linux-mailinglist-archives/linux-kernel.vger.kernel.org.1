Is this timeout for suspend or resume? Somehow I was under the
assumption that it is former? Or is the result seen on resume?

Rereading the race describe above in steps, I think this should be
handled in step c above. Btw is that suspend or runtime suspend which
causes this? Former would be bigger issue as we should not have work
running when we return from suspend call. Latter should be dealt with
anyway as device might be off after suspend.
