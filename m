Do you mean I need to separately submit this patch for dtschema repo?

Would definitions be needed if some schemas want to refer the base graph=20
schema? Or is it like they can just directly include the base schema and=20
definitions are not really required?

But what if they want to extend few properties. For example:

graph.yaml
----------
endpoint {
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 remote-endpoint =3D <>;
};

*audio-graph-card.yaml
----------------------
endpoint {
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 remote-endpoint =3D <>;

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 property-x;
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 node-x {
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 ...
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 };
};

I think currently audio-graph allows few properties at port/ports. I am=20
not sure if Morimoto-san has plans to get rid of this.
