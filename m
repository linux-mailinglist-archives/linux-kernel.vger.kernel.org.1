For drm-misc howto get started:

https://drm.pages.freedesktop.org/maintainer-tools/getting-started.html

And howto get commit rights:

https://drm.pages.freedesktop.org/maintainer-tools/commit-access.html

Once you have the fd.o bug report to request commit rights pls paste
it here so we can get the ack from drm-misc maintainers.
