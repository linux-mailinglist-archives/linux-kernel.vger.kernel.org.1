The goal here is to have a selftest that runs kernel code as part of its ope=
ration. That is, the selftest is, logically, starting in userspace:

setup_evil_state();
ret =3D call_kernel_helper();
check_some_other_stuff();
undo_evil_state();

And the call_kernel_helper() could be moderately specific to the test.
