Note just thinking out loud here.

I'm thinking we just need a mechanism to show a "user notification". This would
be just a plain text string passed from the kernel to userspace. I guess we
may also want some mechanism to build (on the kernel side) a small file
with all possible messages for translation from US English to other languages.

So the idea would be that e.g. gnome-shell can listen for these in some way
and then show a notification in its notification mechanism with the message,
like how it does for when software updates are available for example.

I think we can make this as simple as using the normal printk buffer for this
and prefixing the messages with "USER NOTIFY", we already have some messages
in the kernel which would qualify for this, e.g. in the USB core we have:

                 dev_info(&udev->dev, "not running at top speed; "
                         "connect to a high speed hub\n");

This one is about USB1 vs USB2 ports, but we have a similar one somewhere
for USB2 vs USB3 ports (I think) which would also be an interesting message
to actually show to the user inside the desktop environment.

So sticking with the above example, we could change that to

#define USER_NOTIFY "USER NOTIFY: "

dev_info(&udev->dev, USER_NOTIFY "not running at top speed; connect to a high speed hub\n");

And then userspace would trigger on the "USER NOTIFY: " part, keep the
bit before it (which describes the device) as is, try to translate
the text after it and then combine the text before it + the possibly
translated text after it and show that as a notification.

The reason for (ab)using the printk ring-buffer for this is that
we will still want to have these messages in dmesg too anyways,
so why add a new mechanism and send the same message twice if
we can just tag the messages inside the printk ring-buffer ?

Note the dev_info above would likely be replaced with some new
helper which also does some magic to help with gathering a
list of strings to translate.

Again just thinking out loud here. If anyone has any initial
reaction to this please let me know...

Regards,

Hans
