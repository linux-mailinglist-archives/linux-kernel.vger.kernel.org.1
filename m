Sorry Christian, I don't understand...

Again, it must be always "false", it can be incorrectly "true" and this
too is fixed by Eric's patch.

not sure I understand, but probably the answer is "yes"...

task and task->parent either live in the same namespace or the child's
namespace is the descendant of task->parent's namespace. In both cases
task_pid_nr_ns(tsk, tsk->parent) should return the valid pid_nr and
"force" must be false.

The corner case is release_task() when the last exiting sub-thread sends
a signal on behalf of its ->group_leader, and at this point all the tsk's
pid pointers are NULL, that is why "force" can be falsely "true".

Oleg.
