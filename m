No, it isn't getting any mce error :) It's a Xeon Phi platform. 

We've tried the "mce=off" cmdline option, and the 14% keeps. So we
thought the mce itself isn't the cause.

Yes, I also checked the percpu data part of kernel System map, seems
it only affects alignments of several variables, from 'mce_pooll_banks'
to 'tsc_adjust', and the alignment restores for 'lapic_events', but I
can't see any of them could be related to this malloc microbenchmark

Ok, will do that and report back. 0day has recently upgraded the gcc,
default config, rootfs, so it may take some time to reproduce this with
old gcc/environment (and yes, gcc, kernel config, rootfs could all
affect micro benchmark's result :))
