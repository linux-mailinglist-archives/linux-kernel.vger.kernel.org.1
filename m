Let me try to understand the actual problem. The high memory reclaim has
a target which is proportional to the amount of charged memory. For most
requests that would be SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX though (resp. N times that where
N is the number of memcgs in excess up the hierarchy). I can see to be
insufficient if the memcg is already in a large excess but if the
reclaim can make a forward progress this should just work fine because
each charging context should reclaim at least the contributed amount.

Do you have any insight on why this doesn't work in your situation?
Especially with such a large inactive file list I would be really
surprised if the reclaim was not able to make a forward progress.

Now to your patch. I do not like it much to be honest.
MEM_CGROUP_RECLAIM_RETRIES is quite arbitrary and I neither like it in
memory_high_write because the that is an interruptible context so there
shouldn't be a good reason to give up after $FOO number of failed
attempts. try_charge and memory_max_write are slightly different because
we are invoking OOM killer based on the number of failed attempts.

Also if the current high reclaim scaling is insufficient then we should
be handling that via memcg_nr_pages_over_high rather than effectivelly
unbound number of reclaim retries.

That being said, the changelog should be more specific about the
underlying problem and if the real problem is in the reclaim target then
it should be handled by an increased but still fixed size. If the
throttling is just too aggressive and puts task into sleep even when a
reclaim has been performed then the throttling should be fixed.
