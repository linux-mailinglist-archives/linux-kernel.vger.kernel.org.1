Our hands are not completely tied by the specifications, as a
community we have a non-zero level of influence over standards bodies,
even direct participation in some. So we could do something stronger
than passively wait for standards to catch up. For example, deprecate
our consideration of future specifications that include this language
and set a cut off date.

I understand the confusion that arises from using terminology
differently from the specification, but at the same time when
specification language actively hurts kernel code maintainability we
change it. For example, when I did the first iteration of what
eventually became libnvdimm Ingo rightly reacted to the naming being
too ACPI specification centric and wanting more kernel-centric naming.

If the common kernel name for what was formerly called a "slave"
device is a "subordinate" device then the confusion is lessened, only
one common kernel translation to consider.

"slave" has a direct connection to human suffering deployed at global scale.

One way I think about this is consider we have our first ever Linux
Plumbers on the African continent, and you had a choice about giving a
talk about how the git master branch operates, or a talk about slave
devices which one would you feel more immediately comfortable leading?
Any hesitation you would feel freely using the word slave with a
predominantly black audience is a similar speed bump a contributor
might feel needing to consume that term to get their job done.

Explaining "no, not that connotation of slave" does not scale as much
as transitioning to another term.

This is the start of a process that the kernel community can take an
active role to lead, we have it within our control to not wait for the
lowest common denominator to catch up.

I appreciate the engagement.
