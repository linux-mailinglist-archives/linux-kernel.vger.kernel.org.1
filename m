Having PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS count everything including VM_FAULT_ERROR
is OK. Just major/minor accounting should be only about successes, IIRC from
v1 discussion.

The "new rules" also say

+	 *  - faults that never even got here (because the address
+	 *    wasn't valid). That includes arch_vma_access_permitted()
+	 *    failing above.

VM_FAULT_ERROR, and also the arch-specific VM_FAULT_BADxxx, qualify
as "address wasn't valid" I think, so they should not be counted as
major/minor.

IIRC from v1, and we want to only count success as major/minor, maybe
the rule could also be made more clear about that, e.g. like

+	 *  - unsuccessful faults (because the address wasn't valid)
+	 *    do not count. That includes arch_vma_access_permitted()
+	 *    failing above.

Sounds good to me, and VM_FAULT_BADxxx should never show up here.

Hmm, arm64 already does not count the VM_FAULT_BADxxx, but also does not
call handle_mm_fault() for those, so no change with this patch. arm (and
also unicore32) do count those, but also not call handle_mm_fault(), so
there would be the change that they lose accounting, IIUC.

I agree that this probably can be ignored. The code in arm64 also looks
more recent, so it's probably just a left-over in arm/unicore32 code.
