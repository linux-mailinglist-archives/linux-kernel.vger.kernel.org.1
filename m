An SDCA device will have two regmaps, one for 'regular' registers and 
one for MBQ-based ones. There is no known case where a codec can use 
ONLY an MBQ-based regmap.

It's different from I2C/SMB since the bus is really identical, the 
interface is the same, the difference is really the sequence by which 
you access registers allocated to SDCA and how the address is constructed.

Each SDCA control will be described with a firmware property, and based 
on their range and purpose you would know how if the control is a 
regular one or an MBQ-based one. Alternatively, the driver might 
hard-code things and define addresses for each.

Does this answer to your question?
