In the example, data was copied _from_ the device, not to it.

Unplugging a R/W USB drive without unmounting it first is a great way to 
corrupt the data.

invalidate_partition() is part of the block layer, not part of USB.  It 
gets called whenever a drive is removed from the system, no matter what 
type of drive it is.  You should ask the people involved in that 
subsystem why it takes so long.

Unmounting a drive flushes all the dirty buffers from memory back to the 
drive.  Obviously that can't be done if the drive is unplugged first.

As far as the USB subsystem is concerned, exactly the same amount of 
work is done during disconnect regardless of whether or not the drive is 
mounted.  (In fact, the USB subsystem doesn't even know whether a drive 
is mounted; that concept is part of the block and filesystem layers.)

That seems very unlikely.  When a USB device gets unplugged the system 
realizes it.  Any I/O meant for that device is immediately cancelled; 
there are no timeouts.

(Okay, not strictly true; there is a fraction-of-a-second timeout during 
which the system waits to see whether the disconnect was permanent or 
just a temporary glitch.  But you're talking about 6-second long 
delays.)
