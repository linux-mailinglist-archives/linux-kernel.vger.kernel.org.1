Yes, that's what I meant.  Appreciate your help, Jann.

Right, v2 is broken on that.  That's why I pasted another chunk in my previous
reply to still inherit the UFFD_WP bit even for COW [1].  Previously it was not
needed because UFFD_WP must have been turned off for the pte/pmd/.. before COW
happens.  However with enforced COW that's not guaranteed any more.

I'll post v3 soon.
