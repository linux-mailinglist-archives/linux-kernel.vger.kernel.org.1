Looking at the AMBA driver there is a comment there that AMBA does not
lose state when clocks are removed. This is consistent with the AMBA
protocol spec which states that AMBA slaves can only be accessed /
read / write on various strobe signals,  or state reset on PRESET
signal, all timed by the rising edge of the bus clock. state changes
are not permitted on clock events alone. Given this static nature of
AMBA slaves then removing the clock should not have any effect.

The AMBA driver only /drivers/amba/bus.c  gives permission to
remove/restore the clocks from the devices (pm_suspend pm_resume
callbacks) - this reduces the power consumption of these devices if
the clock is not running, but state must be retained.

Please look at the CoreSight components specification 3.0 (ARM IHI
0029E) Section B2.1.2 which describes the Unique Component Identifier
(UCI).
As mentioned above this consists of a combination of bits from
multiple registers, including PIDR4.
