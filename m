Could we please make these local_lock.h and local_lock_internal.h?  Making
the filenames different from everything else is just irritating!

It's quite peculiar that these operations appear to be pass-by-value. 
All other locking operations are pass-by-reference - spin_lock(&lock),
not spin_lock(lock).  This is what the eye expects to see and it's
simply more logical - calling code shouldn't have to "know" that the
locking operations are implemented as cpp macros.  And we'd be in a
mess if someone tried to convert these to real C functions.

Which prompts the question: why were all these operations implemented
in the processor anyway?  afaict they could have been written in C.
