I'm not sure anything's "improved" - as far as the internet can tell 
it's a special low-cost variant of RK3328 for low-end TV box vendors 
that Rockchip don't want to talk about. The DTB for my H96 Max 3318 
shows no appreciable difference from the BSP DT for RK3328, although I 
wouldn't be surprised if some of the unused stuff like the external GMAC 
was actually missing or broken. The board itself is the exact same one 
used in a lot of other cheap RK3328 boxes (and I mean literally, it's 
silkscreened "RK3328_8D4_V1.2").

Thanks to one unexpectedly honest Aliexpress listing I stumbled across, 
the "penta-core GPU" apparently translates from TV-box-marketing-speak 
to mean Mali-450 MP2 (1GP + 2PP) plus the RGA plus the VOP ;)
