I should maybe add that the reason I'm trying to upstream this is because
I have been repeatedly bitten by this issue for years over many totally
unrelated projects, as have many people I know. If this was a one-off
issue I would not have spent the time writing a kernel patch to fix
it. The supply
chains must be heavily contaminated with counterfeits with how often I've
personally run into this problem.

The damage done by FTDI with their malicious drivers really is hard to quantify,
both in terms of wasted man hours working around this issue and in the
inevitable mountains of e-waste they create by bricking end user hardware.
Most of these customers have likely never even heard of FTDI, they even
intentionally designed their malicious drivers to make it non-obvious that
the failures are due to counterfeits, completely unethical behavior IMO.

FTDI may very well be one of the least environmentally friendly companies
in terms of environmental damage per dollar of revenue.
