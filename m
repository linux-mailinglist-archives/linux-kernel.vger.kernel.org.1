Something like MADV_HUGEPAGE_SYNC? It would be useful, since users have
better and clearer control of getting huge pages from the kernel and
know when they will pay the cost of getting the huge pages.

I would think the suggestion is more about the huge page control options
currently provided by the kernel do not have predictable performance
outcome, since MADV_HUGEPAGE is a best-effort option and does not tell
users whether the marked virtual address range is backed by huge pages
or not when the madvise returns. MADV_HUGEPAGE_SYNC would provide a
deterministic result to users on whether the huge page(s) are formed
or not.
