Sorry, no. my developer machine crashed, so I lost case my container and modified
case. I am struggling to get my container back from a account problematic repository. 

But some testing scripts is here, generally, the original readtwice case will
run each of threads on each of cpus. The new case will run one container on each cpus,
and just run one readtwice thead in each of containers.

Here is readtwice case changes(Just a reference)

we are using thousands memcgs in a machine, but as a simulation, I guess above case
could be helpful to show the problem.

Thanks a lot!

In my testing, case-lru-file-mmap-read has a bit slower, 10+% on 96 thread machine,
when memcg is enabled but unused, that may due to longer pointer jumpping on 
lruvec than pgdat->lru_lock, since cgroup_disable=memory could fully remove the
regression with the new lock path.

I tried reusing page->prviate to store lruvec pointer, that could remove some 
regression on this, since private is generally unused on a lru page. But the patch
is too buggy now. 

BTW, 
Guess memcg would cause more memory disturb on a large machine, if it's enabled but
unused, isn't it?
