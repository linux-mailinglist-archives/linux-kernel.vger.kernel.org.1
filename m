Indeed the addition of stricter checks will expose cases where the links 
are not well configured, probably for years. The patch "ASoC: soc-pcm: 
dpcm: fix playback/capture checks" did not add those checks, only fixed 
them for the multi-dai case.

I think that those configuration errors are the problem and should be 
fixed as a prerequisite to the removal of the duplication between 
dpcm_playback/dpcm_capture/playback_only/capture_only. it may be painful 
and generate noise for a while, but if we only throw a warning what are 
the odds all those configuration errors will eventually be fixed?

If we need more time for validation on all platforms, then maybe we can 
first relax the check for 5.8-rc1 as suggested by John, but re-add the 
-EINVAL on -next to give a target of 5.9 with all configurations fixed?
