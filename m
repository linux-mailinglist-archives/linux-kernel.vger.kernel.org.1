Well, it is more of a 'reference implementation' as there are persons who reached out to me because their builds succeeded, they were able to format in reiser4 SFRN x.y.z, but they were not able to mount their partition(s).
Turns out, they were inadvertently mixing SFRN 4.0.2 with 5.1.3, either in the reiser4 kernel patch -- released with the same in both instances -- or in the reiser4progs.

Acknowledged. Thanks.

That is coming up. I still have to create/customize an image of Metztli Reiser4 SFRN5 for a Google Compute Engine (GCE) minimal ~200GB instance for evaluation.
Fact is 'not all clouds are created equal' -- even if KVM -based. For instance, reiser4 SFRN 4.0.2 on a trial Linode small ~80GB SSD slice(s) with 2 virtual cpus frequently hung under short sustained disk/network I/O usage.
I have not experienced that with reiser4 SFRN 4.0.2 on GCE -- where sometimes I allocate eight to sixteen virtual cpus with 16, 32, or even 64, GBs of RAM, on a region hosting AMD Epyc, for fast kernel building ops.

But testing a relatively small bootable image first will usually provide insight if adding one, two... eight, TB slices will make sense later on.
