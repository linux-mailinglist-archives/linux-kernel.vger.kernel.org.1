One other idea occurred to me that's maybe simpler.  You could in
theory just poll the serial port periodically to accomplish.  It would
actually probably even work to call the normal serial port interrupt
routine from any random CPU.  On many serial drivers the entire
interrupt handler is wrapped with:

spin_lock_irqsave(&uap->port.lock, flags);
...
spin_unlock_irqrestore(&uap->port.lock, flags);

And a few (the ones I was involved in fixing) have the similar pattern
of using uart_unlock_and_check_sysrq().

Any serial drivers following this pattern could have their interrupt
routine called periodically just to poll for characters and it'd be
fine, right?  ...and having it take a second before a sysrq comes in
this case is probably not the end of the world?


One nice benefit of this is that it would actually work _better_ on
SMP systems for any sysrqs that aren't NMI safe.  Specifically with
your patch series those would be queued with irq_work_queue() which
means they'd be blocked if the CPU processing the NMI is stuck with
IRQs disabled.  With the polling mechanism they'd nicely just run on a
different CPU.
