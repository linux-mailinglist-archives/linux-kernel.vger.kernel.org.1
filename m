You know what: I totally agree with you! They are actively harmful and 
shall not be there. End of story.

But *why* you don't let me work step-by-step and *focus on one task* at 
a time?

I.e. focus (for now) on HTTP links which shall stay in the kernel tree 
rather than on the ones which shall not.

IMAO both domains have literally nothing to do with e.g. the HTTPSified 
www.ti.com and ww1.microchip.com.

My trainers (employer) taught me to split commits (patches) per one 
thing I've done. (What you asked for is a legit thing, but it's another 
thing.)

Also *after* finishing my current todo list I'll think about automating 
the detection of such. (This would have a much larger coverage.)
