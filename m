That's fine, the kernel does not tell userspace "EOF", that is up to the
libc to determine.  If you read the data from the hardware once, and
keep it in your buffer, simple_read_from_buffer() will handle all of
that logic for you, please let it do that.

All hardware things, please use sysfs, that is what it is designed for.

A patch series is great to create and send showing all of that.

Make it explicitly hardware specific in your userspace location.
Otherwise you just defined this for all hardware types, with what you
used above, and I do not think you wanted to do that.

It provides information on what is going on with the firmware, it's up
to userspace to know/determine/care if that means anything with regards
to "security" or not :)
