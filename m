I'm not entirely happy about the random differences between modesets
and other commits. Ideally we wouldn't need any.

Anyways, even if we ignore modesets we still have the issue with
atomicity guarantees across multiple crtcs. So I think we still
don't want per-crtc threads, rather it should be thread for each 
commit.

Well, if the crtcs aren't running in lockstep then maybe we could
shove them off to separate threads, but that'll just complicate things
needlessly I think since we'd need yet another way to iterate
the crtcs in each thread. With the thread-per-commit apporach we
can just use the normal atomic iterators.

This is a bit dejavu of the vblank worker discussion, where I actually
did want a per-crtc RT kthread but people weren't convinced they
actually help. The difference is that for vblank workers we actually
tried to get some numbers, here I've not seen any.
