Cool, so our MC has been approved:
https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/event/7/page/80-accepted-microconferences#llvm-cr

But we're super tight on time and probably won't be able to do a
session on s390 at the MC.  That said, I have just submitted a BoF
proposal since we have more topics internal to our group we'd like to
have more time to discuss.  I've added s390 testing to the list of
potential topics, too.  I'll re-ping this thread once I hear back
about whether it gets approved or not.

That said, we do meet once every other week virtually online, see
links: https://clangbuiltlinux.github.io/.

That's awesome; I'd love to get the chance to meet your s390 LLVM
team; in general it can take a while to get bugs routed to folks most
empowered to fix them until you know who they are.

Would you, any fellow s390 kernel and LLVM folks be interested in
attending one of our virtual meetings, even if it's just to say "hi"
quickly? Next one is next Wednesday.

Usually we go over whatever firedrills we've been running the past two
weeks, but sometimes have presentations of folks projects and
research.  I think it would be cool to get more background on s390 and
work out the issues we're running into with testing.
