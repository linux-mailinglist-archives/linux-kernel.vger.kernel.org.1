Yes, I just don't like random constants, even temporary. I was just 
thinking of something like that:

#define KASLR_RANDOM_OFFSET 0x10000000

But it's up to you of course.

I may be mistaken here, but flush_icache_range uses sfence.i instruction 
that guarantees that following instruction fetches will see previously 
written data. But this works for the local hart: what if other harts 
already have a match in their instruction cache ? The ISA spec states:

"FENCE.I does not ensure that other RISC-V harts’ instruction fetches 
will observe the local hart’s stores in a multiprocessor system. To make 
a store to instruction memory visible to all RISC-V harts, the writing 
hart has to execute a data FENCE before requesting that all remote 
RISC-V harts execute a FENCE.I"

Oh right, setup_vm creates a mapping that only covers the kernel and not 
a zone that spans an entire PGD: then you have to create mapping for the 
destination.

The first time we enter setup_vm, relocations are done based on current 
kernel_virt_addr so the GOT is already filled with virtual addresses 
when MMU is disabled and it works since init.c is compiled with -fno-pie 
option. So I'm not sure it would work differently from what you already do.
