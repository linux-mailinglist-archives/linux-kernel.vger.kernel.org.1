I agree. That was a bit of laziness in part, to limit the changes to the
existing drivers, where almost everyone, except the ETM would need to
simply use the MMIO approach. So, in order to keep those changes to
minimum, i.e, simply initialize the base, I used the inverted logic.
I will fix it.

Mistake ;-). I will address all of the comments above in my next version.

If someone is reading the values, they might do something with the
value, i.e, make a decision when they shouldn't. This is just to prevent
such cases.

Sure. I am looking for thoughts on the proposed API (not ABI) changes,
as they are quite significant and invasive changes in the code, without
much functionality changes.


Thank you for the review !
