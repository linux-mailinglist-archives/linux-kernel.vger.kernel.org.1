Hi Srini,
Thanks for taking a look.
Let me try to clarify your comments in case there is any misunderstanding.

I understand your request on having different board variations using
different sound card names through model property, and I totally agree
with that.
As for compatible strings, do you insist on having all the board
variations using exactly the same compatible string ?

Thanks!
