Thanks for the detailed analysis. It looks like you are missing the
following fix patch in your tree which basically fixed broken
tee_shm_alloc() in case dynamic shared memory is enabled (IIRC
virtualization only supports dynamic shared memory).

commit a249dd200d03791cab23e47571f3e13d9c72af6c

    tee: optee: Fix dynamic shm pool allocations

    In case of dynamic shared memory pool, kernel memory allocated using
    dmabuf_mgr pool needs to be registered with OP-TEE prior to its usage
    during optee_open_session() or optee_invoke_func().

    So fix dmabuf_mgr pool allocations via an additional call to
    optee_shm_register().

    Also, allow kernel pages to be registered as shared memory with OP-TEE.

    Fixes: 9733b072a12a ("optee: allow to work without static shared memory")

After this fix, your issue should be resolved as it uses
OPTEE_MSG_ATTR_NONCONTIG attribute for kernel memory allocated via
tee_shm_alloc().

As you can see above, tee_shm_alloc() being broken in your case was
detected via this simple pseudo TA invocation. So IMO, it would be
better to keep the existing behaviour as it provides a kind of basic
OP-TEE driver runtime self test too. Also, I think it would be a
better user experience to have every OP-TEE interface working rather
than a partially broken interface.
