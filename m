I don't think this is possible.  Once you untangle all the wrappers,
the call sites are effectively:

__this_cpu_write(xen_in_preemptible_hcall, true);
CALL_NOSPEC to the hypercall page
__this_cpu_write(xen_in_preemptible_hcall, false);

I think IF=1 when this happens, but I won't swear to it.  RCU had
better be watching.

As I understand it, the one and only situation Xen wants to handle is
that an interrupt gets delivered during the hypercall.  The hypervisor
is too clever for its own good and deals with this by rewinding RIP to
the beginning of whatever instruction did the hypercall and delivers
the interrupt, and we end up in this handler.  So, if this happens,
the idea is to not only handle the interrupt but to schedule if
scheduling would be useful.

So I don't think we need all this RCU magic.  This really ought to be
able to be simplified to:

idtentry_exit();

if (appropriate condition)
  schedule();

Obviously we don't want to schedule if this is a nested entry, but we
should be able to rule that out by checking that regs->flags &
X86_EFLAGS_IF and by handling the percpu variable a little more
intelligently.  So maybe the right approach is:

bool in_preemptible_hcall = __this_cpu_read(xen_in_preemptible_hcall);
__this_cpu_write(xen_in_preemptible_hcall, false);
idtentry_enter(...);

do the acutal work;

idtentry_exit(...);

if (in_preemptible_hcall) {
  assert regs->flags & X86_EFLAGS_IF;
  assert that RCU is watching;
  assert that we're on the thread stack;
  assert whatever else we feel like asserting;
  if (need_resched())
    schedule();
}

__this_cpu_write(xen_in_preemptible_hcall, in_preemptible_hcall);

And now we don't have a special idtentry_exit() case just for Xen, and
all the mess is entirely contained in the Xen PV code.  And we need to
mark all the preemptible hypercalls noinstr.  Does this seem
reasonable?

That being said, right now, with or without your patch, I think we're
toast if the preemptible hypercall code gets traced.  So maybe the
right thing is to just drop all the magic preemption stuff from your
patch and let the Xen maintainers submit something new (maybe like
what I suggest above) if they want magic preemption back.
