Instead of adding the support for individual drivers, you could handle this
in the generic perf layer. e.g, Fail perf_event create with an attribute
which allows kernel tracing ?

if (!attr.exclude_kernel)
	return -EINVAL;

Or even exclude the kernel silently always.

This could also be limited to PMUs with PERF_PMU_CAP_ITRACE, if you
want to limit this to PMUs that instruction level tracing.
