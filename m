printk wants to store various timestamps (MONOTONIC, REALTIME, BOOTTIME) to
make correlation of dmesg from several systems easier.

Provide an interface to retrieve all three timestamps in one go.

There are some caveats:

1) Boot time and late sleep time injection

  Boot time is a racy access on 32bit systems if the sleep time injection
  happens late during resume and not in timekeeping_resume(). That could be
  avoided by expanding struct tk_read_base with boot offset for 32bit and
  adding more overhead to the update. As this is a hard to observe once per
  resume event which can be filtered with reasonable effort using the
  accurate mono/real timestamps, it's probably not worth the trouble.

  Aside of that it might be possible on 32 and 64 bit to observe the
  following when the sleep time injection happens late:

  CPU 0				         CPU 1
  timekeeping_resume()
  ktime_get_fast_timestamps()
    mono, real = __ktime_get_real_fast()
  					 inject_sleep_time()
  					   update boot offset
  	boot = mono + bootoffset;
  
  That means that boot time already has the sleep time adjustment, but
  real time does not. On the next readout both are in sync again.
  
  Preventing this for 64bit is not really feasible without destroying the
  careful cache layout of the timekeeper because the sequence count and
  struct tk_read_base would then need two cache lines instead of one.

2) Suspend/resume timestamps

   Access to the time keeper clock source is disabled accross the innermost
   steps of suspend/resume. The accessors still work, but the timestamps
   are frozen until time keeping is resumed which happens very early.

   For regular suspend/resume there is no observable difference vs. sched
   clock, but it might affect some of the nasty low level debug printks.

   OTOH, access to sched clock is not guaranteed accross suspend/resume on
   all systems either so it depends on the hardware in use.

   If that turns out to be a real problem then this could be mitigated by
   using sched clock in a similar way as during early boot. But it's not as
   trivial as on early boot because it needs some careful protection
   against the clock monotonic timestamp jumping backwards on resume.
