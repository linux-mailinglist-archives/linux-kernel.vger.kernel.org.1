Currently, the only way to remove MFD children is with a call to
mfd_remove_devices, which will remove all the children. Under
some circumstances it is useful to remove only a subset of the
child devices. For example if some additional clean up is required
between removal of certain child devices.

To accomplish this a tag field is added to mfd_cell, and a
corresponding mfd_remove_devices_by_tag function is added to
remove children with a specific tag. This allows a good amount of
flexibility in which child devices a driver wishes to remove, as a
driver could target specific drivers or a large group. Allowing other
use-cases such as removing drivers for functionality that is no longer
required.

Some investigation was done of using the mfd_cell name and id fields,
but it is hard to achieve a good level of flexibility there, at least
without significant complexity. Since the id gets modified by the core
and can even by automatically generated. Using the name alone would
work for my usecase but it is not hard to imagine a situation where it
wouldn't.

Happy to discuss other approaches as well, but this one was quite                                                                                                                                                                              │··················
appealing as it was very simple but affords quite a lot of flexibility.                                                                                                                                                                        │··················


Changes since v1:
 - Use a pointer to pass the tag to mfd_remove_devices_fn

Thanks,
