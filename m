We have a layering problem now. Maybe we should just have an MTD
internal variable like min_written_pages_before_erase that the Micron
driver could set to a !0 value.

Then, the handling could be done by the user (UBI/UBIFS, JFFS2, MTD
user if exported).

When you take my patches in your series, especially when not touching
them at all, you should keep my Authorship and SoB first, then add your
SoB.
