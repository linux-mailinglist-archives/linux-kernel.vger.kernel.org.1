Hmm, I had a look at the implementation and I'm not at all convinced that
it's correct. First of all, the comment above it states:

 * NOTE: using list_empty_careful() without synchronization
 * can only be safe if the only activity that can happen
 * to the list entry is list_del_init(). Eg. it cannot be used
 * if another CPU could re-list_add() it.

but it seems that people disregard this note and instead use it as a
general-purpose lockless test, taking a lock and rechecking if it returns
non-empty. It would also mean we'd have to keep the WRITE_ONCE() in
INIT_LIST_HEAD, which is something that I've been trying to remove.

In the face of something like a concurrent list_add(); list_add_tail()
sequence, then the tearing writes to the head->{prev,next} pointers could
cause list_empty_careful() to indicate that the list is momentarily empty.

I've started looking at whether we can use a NULL next pointer to indicate
an empty list, which might allow us to kill the __list_del_clearprev() hack
at the same time, but I've not found enough time to really get my teeth into
it yet.
