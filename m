I'm fine with this specific change ... so

Acked-by: Tony Luck <tony.luck@intel.com>

for anyone picking up all of these treewide: patches
(if they don't, then I can apply this to the ia64 tree)


But a question ... is sizeof still ok on a structure that
contains a flexible-array-member?

E.g. I'd expect:

struct foo {
        int stuff;
        struct boo array[];
};

	printk("size of foo = %d\n", sizeof(struct foo));

To not give any complilation warnings and to tell me that
the size of the structure is 4 bytes.

Is that still true and OK?
