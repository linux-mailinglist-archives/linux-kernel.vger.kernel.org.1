Here's v3 of SBI PMU extension which tries to cover CYCLE CSR, INSTRET CSR,
HPMCOUNTER CSRs and software counters of the SBI implementation.

To define SBI PMU extension, we first define counter_idx which is a unique
number assigned to a counter and event_idx which is an encoded number
representing event to be monitored.

The SBI PMU event_idx is 15bit number encoded as follows:
event_idx[14:12] = type
event_idx[11:0] = code

If event_idx.type == 0 then it is HARDWARE event and event_idx.code can
be one of the following:
enum sbi_pmu_hw_id {
    /*
     * Common hardware events, generalized by the kernel:
     */
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES        = 0,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_INSTRUCTIONS        = 1,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_REFERENCES        = 2,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_MISSES        = 3,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS    = 4,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_BRANCH_MISSES        = 5,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_BUS_CYCLES        = 6,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_STALLED_CYCLES_FRONTEND    = 7,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_STALLED_CYCLES_BACKEND    = 8,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_REF_CPU_CYCLES        = 9,

    PERF_COUNT_HW_MAX,            /* non-ABI */
};
(NOTE: Same as described in <linux_source>/include/uapi/linux/perf_event.h)

If event_idx.type == 1 then it is CACHE event and event_idx.code is encoded
as follows:
event_idx.code[11:4] = cache_id
event_idx.code[3:1] = op_id
event_idx.code[0:0] = result_id
enum sbi_pmu_hw_cache_id {
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_L1D            = 0,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_L1I            = 1,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_LL            = 2,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_DTLB        = 3,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_ITLB        = 4,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_BPU            = 5,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_NODE        = 6,

    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_MAX,        /* non-ABI */
};
enum sbi_pmu_hw_cache_op_id {
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_OP_READ        = 0,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_OP_WRITE        = 1,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_OP_PREFETCH        = 2,

    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_OP_MAX,        /* non-ABI */
};
enum sbi_pmu_hw_cache_op_result_id {
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_RESULT_ACCESS    = 0,
    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_RESULT_MISS        = 1,

    PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_RESULT_MAX,        /* non-ABI */
};
(NOTE: Same as described in <linux_source>/include/uapi/linux/perf_event.h)

If event_idx.type == 2 then it is RAW event and event_idx.code is just
a RAW event number.

In future, more event_idx can be defined without breaking ABI compatibility
of SBI calls.

Based on above definition of counter_idx definition, we can potentially have
the following SBI calls:

1. SBI_PMU_NUM_COUNTERS
   This call will return the number of COUNTERs
2. SBI_PMU_COUNTER_DESCRIBE
   This call takes two parameters: 1) counter_idx 2) physical address of 4k page
   It will write the description of SBI PMU counter at specified physical
   address. The details of the SBI PMU counter written at specified physical
   address are as follows:
   1. Name (64 bytes)
   2. CSR_Offset (4 bytes)
      (E.g. CSR_Offset == 0x2 imply CSR 0xC02)
      (E.g. CSR_Offset == 0xffffffff means it is SBI implementation counter)
   3. CSR_Width (4 bytes)
      (Number of CSR bits implemented in HW)
   4. Event bitmap (2048 bytes) (i.e. 1-bit for each possible event_idx)
      (If bit corresponding to a event_idx is 1 then event_idx is supported
       by the counter)
   5. Any thing else ??
3. SBI_PMU_COUNTER_SET_PHYS_ADDR
   This call takes two parameters: 1) counter_idx 2) physical address
   It will set the physical address where SBI implementation will write
   the software counter. This SBI call is only for counters not mapped
   to any CSR (i.e. only for counters with CSR_Offset == 0xffffffff).
4. SBI_PMU_COUNTER_START
   This call takes two parameters: 1) counter_idx 2) event_idx
   It will inform SBI implementation to configure and start/enable specified
   counter on the calling HART to monitor specified event. This SBI call will
   fail for counters which are not present.
5. SBI_PMU_COUNTER_STOP
   This call takes one parameter: 1) counter_idx
   It will inform SBI implementation to stop/disable specified counters on the
   calling HART. This SBI call will fail for counters which are not present.

From above, the RISC-V PMU driver will use most of the SBI calls at boot time.
Only SBI_PMU_COUNTER_START to used once before using the counter. The reading
of counter is by reading CSR (for CSR_Offset != 0xffffffff) OR by reading
memory location (for CSR_Offset == 0xffffffff). The counter overflow handling
will have to be done in software by Linux kernel.

The information returned by SBI_PMU_NUM_COUNTERS and SBI_PMU_COUNTER_DESCRIBE
can be passed via DT/ACPI but it will be difficult to maintain because we
have hardware counters and SBI implementation counters both provided by SBI
PMU extension. The SBI implementation counters are specific to underlying
SBI implementation so we will have to keep counters/events described in
DT/ACPI in-sync with underlying SBI implementation.
