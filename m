Thanks for looking into the proposal. Let me answer both of your
questions together. I have added the two use-cases but let me explain
the proactive reclaim a bit more as we actually use that in our
production.

We have defined tolerable refault rates for the applications based on
their type (latency sensitive or not). Proactive reclaim is triggered
in the application based on their current refault rates and usage. If
the current refault rate exceeds the tolerable refault rate then
stop/slowdown the proactive reclaim.

For the second question, yes, each individual refault can induce the
stall as well but we have more control on that stall as compared to
stalls due to reclaim. For us almost all the reclaimable memory is
anon and we use compression based swap, so, the cost of each refault
is fixed and a couple of microseconds.

I think the next question is what about the refaults from disk or
source with highly variable cost. Usually the latency sensitive
applications remove such uncertainty by mlocking the pages backed by
such backends (e.g. mlocking the executable) or at least that is the
case for us.

Thanks,
Shakeel
