Well, then at the next time, please mention it explicitly in the cover
letter.  Usually this kind of API conversion isn't done during rc.  Or
it's done systematically via script or such.  So unless mentioned,
it's not expected to be carried to 5.9.

In anyway, if the final purpose is to drop the old tasklet API and
that's the plan for 5.9, all tree-wide changes have to be done in
5.9 beforehand.  Was that the decision?

Adapting the changes are trivial, don't worry.  It was just a question
of how to organize changes.


thanks,
