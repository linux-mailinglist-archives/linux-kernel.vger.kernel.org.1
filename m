I am not going to apply any new patches before end of merge window, so
if you can still push it to Greg for v5.10, then please take it. However
I think Greg also does not take patches during merge window, so most
likely this will wait for the next cycle. In such case let's do it via
stable tag for DFL parts.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
