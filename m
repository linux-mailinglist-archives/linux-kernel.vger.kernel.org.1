H/W is actually fine :)   Its just that the driver is written to
_also_ support a platform (my original) that doesn't have shmem and
need to pass data via 32bit registers.
Frankly, I am not against the doorbell mode, I am against implementing
two modes in a driver. If it really helped (note the past tense) the
SCMI, we could implement the driver only in doorbell mode but
unfortunately SCMI would still be _broken_ for non-doorbell
controllers.
