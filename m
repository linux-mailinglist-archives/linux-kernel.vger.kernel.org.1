After talking to Prashant it seems that any device with coreboot built before a certain point (a particular fix for device hierarchy in ACPI tables of Chrome devices which happened in mid-April) will not be able to correctly initialize the driver and will get a kernel panic trying to do so.

kind of "defensive-programming" it's not something that should matter to upstream.
