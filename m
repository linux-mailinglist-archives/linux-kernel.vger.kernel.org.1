Why change the user name here?  No need for that, right?  Unless you
really want to, and think that no one will notice.  If so, fine, change
them :)

No one knows what "DFL" is, and odds are, if a different subsystem wants
to use it, they will have their own variant, right?

And why didn't you all use device tree?  How did this sneak in past
everyone?
