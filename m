IIRC the gain came from an odd side effect - which can probably
be got (for some compiler versions) by other means.

I was looking at that.
You'd need to do the first 16 rounds then rounds 17-63 in a second
loop to avoid the conditional.
The problem is that it needs too many registers.
You'd need registers for 16 W values, the 8 a-h and a few spare.

...

Looking closely each round is like:
        t1 = h + e1(e) + Ch(e, f, g) + 0x428a2f98 + W[0];
        t2 = e0(a) + Maj(a, b, c);
        h = t1 + t2;   // Not used for a few rounds
        d += t1;       // Needed next round
So only needs 4 of the state variables (e, f, g, h).
The next round uses d, e, f and g.
So with extreme care d and h can use the same register.
Although I'm not sure how you'd get the compiler to do it.
Possibly making state[] volatile (or using READ/WRITE_ONCE).
So the last two lines become:
        state[7] = t1 + t2;
        d = state[3] + t1;
That might stop the x86 (32bit) spilling registers.
