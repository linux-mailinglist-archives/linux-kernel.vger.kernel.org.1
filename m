It would be interesting if you can demonstrate some significant
performance improvements compared to the same workload with BBM.

I'm not completely convinced this would change much, given that
it is only when moving from a table to a block mapping that you
can elide BBM when the support level is 1 or 2. As far as I can
tell, this only happens in the "stop logging" case.

Is that something that happens often enough to justify the added
complexity? Having to handle TLB Conflict Abort is annoying, for
example.

That would be awesome, and I'd be very grateful if you did. It is the
second time we break this exact case, and having a reliable way to
verify it would definitely help.

Thanks,

         M.
