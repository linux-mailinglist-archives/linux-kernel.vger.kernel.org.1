I tried this and it fixed 5.8 for me with your config above. I'm appending
a patch that does just this. I didn't test other configs as I don't know
which ones to test though. If it fixes the problem for you, maybe it can
be picked by the PPC maintainers.

Subject: powerpc: fix circular dependency in percpu.h

After random.h started to include percpu.h (commit f227e3e), several
archs broke in circular dependencies around percpu.h.

In https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200802204842.36bca162@canb.auug.org.au/
Stephen Rothwell reported breakage for powerpc with CONFIG_PPC_FSL_BOOK3E.

It turns out that asm/percpu.h includes asm/paca.h, which itself
includes mmu.h, which includes percpu.h when CONFIG_PPC_FSL_BOOK3E=y.

Percpu seems to include asm/paca.h only for local_paca which is used in
the __my_cpu_offset macro. Removing this include solves the issue for
this config.
