My recollection of this is quite different -- sybot was sending multiple
zeroday exploits per week to the public xfs list, and nobody at Google
was helping us to /fix/ those bugs.  Each report took hours of developer
time to extract the malicious image (because Dmitry couldn't figure out
how to add that ability to syzbot) and syscall sequence from the
reproducer program, plus whatever time it took to craft a patch, test
it, and push it through review.

Dave and I complained to Dmitry about how the community had zero input
into the rate at which syzbot was allowed to look for xfs bugs.  Nobody
at Google would commit to helping fix any of the XFS bugs, and Dmitry
would not give us better choices than (a) Google AI continuing to create
zerodays and leaving the community to clean up the mess, or (b) shutting
off syzbot entirely.  At the time I said I would accept letting syzbot
run against xfs until it finds something, and turning it off until we
resolve the issue.  That wasn't acceptable, because (I guess) nobody at
Google wants to put /any/ staff time into XFS at all.

TLDR: XFS /does/ accept bug reports about fuzzed and broken images.
What we don't want is make-work Google AIs spraying zeroday code in
public places and the community developers having to clean up the mess.

None of them are, that's why you can't mount local filesystems as an
unprivileged user by default.  At a bare minimum you'd have to audit the
fs driver code to make sure it's robust against unexpected metadata; and
since filesystems store complex relational data across multiple indices,
you end up needing to hoist a full fsck into the mount process.

Or retain the current behavior, which is to delegate the trust decision
to the sysadmin.  It's not just an XFS thing.
