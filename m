Thanks Rachit,

Would be good if you can send a formal patch for the adaptive queuing so
people can have a look.

One thing that was left on the table is weather this should be a full
blown scheduler or a core block infrastructure that would either be
set on-demand or by default.

I think that Jens and Ming expressed that this should be something that
we should place this in the block core, but I'd like to hear maybe
Ming can elaborate on his ideas how to do this.
