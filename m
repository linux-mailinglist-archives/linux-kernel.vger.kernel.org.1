Yes, it's pretty old, but if you follow the thread and look at the
patch I'm fairly certain it's still relevant.  Specifically, following
one thread of dma_map_single() on arm64:

dma_map_single()
-> dma_map_single_attrs()
--> dma_map_page_attrs()
---> dma_direct_map_page()
----> arch_sync_dma_for_device()
-----> __dma_map_area()
------> __dma_inv_area() which has a "dsb"

I'm sure there are lots of other possible paths, but one thing pointed
out by following that path is 'DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC'.  The
documentation of that option talks about the normal flow.  It says
that in the normal flow that dma_map_{single,page,sg} will
synchronize.  We are in the normal flow here.

As far as I understand, the whole point of dma_map_single() is to take
a given buffer and get it all ready so that if a device does DMA on it
right after the function exits that it's all set.

I'm not an expert either, but it really looks like dma_map_single()
does all that we need it to.

I'm all for avoiding using the relaxed variants too except if it's
been shown to be a performance problem.  The one hesitation I have,
though, is that I've spent time poking a bunch at the geni SPI driver.
We do _a lot_ of very small SPI transfers on our system.  For each of
these it's gotta setup a lot of commands.  When I was poking I
definitely noticed the difference between writel() and
writel_relaxed().  If we can save a few microseconds on each one of
these transfers it's probably worth it since it's effectively in the
inner loop of some transfers.

One option I thought of was to track the mode (DMA vs. FIFO) and only
do writel() for DMA mode.  If you're not convinced by my arguments
about dma_map_single(), would you be good with just doing the
non-relaxed version if we're in DMA mode?
