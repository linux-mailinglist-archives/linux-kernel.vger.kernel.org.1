Ah, yes I am using gentoo. I didn't realize that was a distro
modification.

This is incorrect (or maybe I'm not understanding you correctly). X is a
symbol whose final location relative to startup_32 is in most cases not
known to the assembler (there are a couple of cases where X is a label
within .head.text which do get completely resolved by the assembler).

For example, taking the instruction loading the gdt address, this is
what we get from the assembler:
	lea	la(gdt)(%ebp), %eax
becomes in the object file:
  11:   8d 85 00 00 00 00       lea    0x0(%ebp),%eax
			13: R_X86_64_PC32       .data+0x23
or a cleaner example using a global symbol:
	subl	la(image_offset)(%ebp), %ebx
becomes
  41:   2b 9d 00 00 00 00       sub    0x0(%ebp),%ebx
			43: R_X86_64_PC32       image_offset+0x43

So in general you get PC32 relocations, with the addend being set by the
assembler to .-startup_32, modulo the adjustment for where within the
instruction the displacement needs to be. These relocations are resolved
by the static linker to produce constants in the final executable.

Yeah, the more standard term is virtual address/VMA, but that sounds
confusing to me with PIE code since the _actual_ virtual address at
which this code is going to run isn't 0, that's just the address assumed
for linking. I can reword it to avoid referencing "link address" but
then it's not obvious why the macro is named "la" :) I'm open to
suggestions on a better name, I could use offset but that's a bit
long-winded. I could just use vma() if nobody else finds it confusing.

Thanks.
