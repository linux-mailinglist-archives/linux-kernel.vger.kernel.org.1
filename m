Here it is: [1]


Be aware that it truly is humongous and should be split (I couldn't resist adding missing pins/dma while cleaning things up) and it.. was not really intended to be sent as-is. It's also supposed to work on the previous release of Linux, so some Samsung DTs in particular changed since and will need some manual rebasing. But I'll happily leave it as a reference if somebody has the time to pick it up. The konrad/8974 branch in this repo contains more (beware, GPU ones are untested!) 8974 fixes and I have some more on my drive that are.. not really ready for their prime time just yet either..
