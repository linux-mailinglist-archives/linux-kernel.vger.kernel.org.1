While I think a number of the people did overlap, it was not everyone as
the processes are _VERY_ different for obvious reasons.

So please keep it separate for now.  There is a list of people who care
about this document, in the document itself, if anyone ever wants to
send changes to it.  No need to enumerate them all in the MAINTAINERS
file.
