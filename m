Seems you mentioned the static region update. I have the pcie based FPGA
card, and the pcie endpoint is implemented in FPGA static region. So after
I have written image into Flash (over USB or other ways), and trying to
load it to FPGA, the pcie endpoint is also disfunctional, the pcie device
is actually lost. We need to rescan the pcie bus after loading is finished.

The concern is that when the pcie device lost, the 'discoverable' region
created by the pcie driver is also destroyed. When you rescaned the pcie
device back, it is like everything is start over again (pci probe, fpga
region creation, subdev enumeration ...) rather than just a re-enumeration
callback for discoverable region.

How do you think about it?

I have the FPGA board whose image binary for static region is stored in Flash.
I was able to enumerate the Flash as MTD device and update it directly, (now
switch to another interface for security support). 
Do you mean I should avoid doing that cause FPGA region device is unaware of
the update? Some interface in FPGA region would be better choice?

Thanks!
