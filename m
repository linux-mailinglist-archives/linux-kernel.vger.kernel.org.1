I've been pouring through the rpmh-rsc code and trying to understand
it.  Document everything to the best of my ability.  All documentation
here is strictly from code analysis--no actual knowledge of the
hardware was used.  If something is wrong in here I either
misunderstood the code, had a typo, or the code has a bug in it
leading to my incorrect understanding.

In a few places here I have documented things that don't make tons of
sense.  A future patch will try to address this.  While this means I'm
adding comments / todos and then later fixing them in the series, it
seemed more urgent to get things documented first so that people could
understand the later patches.

Any comments I adjusted I also tried to make match kernel-doc better.
Specifically:
- kernel-doc says do not leave a blank line between the function
  description and the arguments
- kernel-doc examples always have things starting w/ a capital and
  ending with a period.

This should be a no-op.  It's just comment changes.

Changes in v4: None
Changes in v3:
- Adjusted comments for rpmh_rsc_write_ctrl_data().
- Comments for new enable_tcs_irq() function.
- Comments for new rpmh_rsc_cpu_pm_callback() function.
- Mention in message that I also fixed up kernel-doc stuff.
- Moved comments patch after ("Kill cmd_cache and find_match...").
- One space after a period now (Maulik).
- Plural of TCS fixed to TCSes following Maulik's example.
- Re-added comment in tcs_write() about checking for same address.
- Rebased atop v16 ('Invoke rpmh_flush...') series.
- __tcs_set_trigger() comments adjusted now that it can set or unset.
- get_tcs_for_msg() documents why it's safe to borrow the wake TCS.
- get_tcs_for_msg() no longer returns -EAGAIN.

Changes in v2:
- Document bug of tcs_write() not handling -EAGAIN.
- Document get_tcs_for_msg() => -EAGAIN only for ACTIVE_ONLY.
- Document locks for updating "tcs_in_use" more.
- Document tcs_is_free() without drv->lock OK for tcs_invalidate().
- Document that rpmh_rsc_send_data() can be an implicit invalidate.
- Document two get_tcs_for_msg() issues if zero-active TCS.
- Fixed documentation of "tcs" param in find_slots().
- More clear that active-only xfers can happen on wake TCS sometimes.
- Reword tcs_write() doc a bit.
