Ah, true enough if the various NAPI-like devices give up the CPU from
time to time.  Which they might well do for all I know.

;-) ;-) ;-)

If there are workloads that would like to be able to keep one or more
CPUs completely busy handling interrupts, it should be possible to
create something that is used sort of like cond_resched() to keep RCU,
the scheduler, and the various watchdogs and lockup detectors at bay.

For example, RCU could supply a function that checked to make sure that
it was in an interrupt from idle, and if so report a quiescent state
for that CPU.  So if the CPU was idle and there wasn't anything pending
for it, that CPU could safely stay in a hardirq handler indefinitely.
I suppose that the function should return an indication in cases such
as interrupt from non-idle.

Sort of like NO_HZ_FULL, but for hardirq handlers, and also allowing
those handlers to use RCU read-side critical sections.

Or we could do what all the cool kids do these days, namely just apply
machine learning, thus automatically self-tuning in real time.

/me runs...
