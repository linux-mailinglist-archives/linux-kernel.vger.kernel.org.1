Hmm, took another look at the option CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN
config PHYSICAL_ALIGN
        hex "Alignment value to which kernel should be aligned"
        default "0x200000"
        range 0x2000 0x1000000 if X86_32
        range 0x200000 0x1000000 if X86_64

According to above, I think the 16M should come from the largest value
But the default value is 2M,  with smaller value reservation can have
more chance to succeed.

It seems we still need arch specific CRASH_ALIGN, but the initial
version you added the #ifdef for different arches, can you move the
macro to arch specific headers?

Thanks
Dave
