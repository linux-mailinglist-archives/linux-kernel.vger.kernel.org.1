I knew there was an issue but I couldn't remember the reasoning, and
figured you could easily answer it without having to look back at the
code.

What's wrong with priority boosting the idle task? It's not obvious,
and I can't find comments in the code saying it would be bad.

I looked around the code to see if I could find "why this is bad" but
couldn't find it. There's lots of places that say "Do not use
mutex_trylock in interrupt context, the implementation is not safe to
do so" but I can't find where it says "why" it is not safe to do so.

The idle task is not mentioned at all in rtmutex.c and not mentioned in
kernel/locking except for some comments about RCU in lockdep.

I see that in the idle code the prio_change method does a BUG(), but
there's no comment to say why it does so.

The commit that added that BUG, doesn't explain why it can't happen:

a8941d7ec8167 ("sched: Simplify the idle scheduling class")

I may have once known the rationale behind all this, but it's been a
long time since I worked on the PI code, and it's out of my cache.
