The connector is supposed to have 'ports' for USB2, USB3, and Aux
unless the parent is the USB controller.

This all goes away if you have ports in the connector node. More below.

This is wrong in that 'phys' are not part of the graph. It's the DP
and USB controllers that should be part of the graph. Any phys are
referenced with the phys binding and are not part of the graph.

This should have an output port and then that is connected to the USB
connector. Given that DP is muxed with the USB SS signals, port@1
(defined as USB SS) should then have 2 endpoints.

Then the only new thing here is how to represent the GPIO line
controlling the mux. Normally, I'd expect this to be in the parent of
the connector (the type-C controller), but since you have multiple
connectors, that doesn't work so well. So you can put 'mux-gpios' in
the port@1 node. (Or maybe it should be 'mux-controls' with a gpio mux
defined elsewhere).
