No - the new mode prevents race conditions where the thread shutting
down the SMMU does the ETR shutdown, but then another thread happens
to be trying to start trace and restarts the ETR.
It also prevents the condition Mathieu discussed where a thread might
be attempting to shutdown trace - this could try to disable the
hardware again re-releasing resources/ re-flushing and waiting for
stop.

Mike
