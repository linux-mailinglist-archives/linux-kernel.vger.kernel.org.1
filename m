As I have told couple of times there is no issue for me to rebase on any
subsytem tree. Do you want EFI one as a base?

Thank you for that, but as far as I'm concerned those calls are not significant
in the second kernel for my test purposes. Basically the issue is to supply DMI
information, which is static, to the second kernel.

And I do not need. At least I haven't (yet?) found an issue with that.

We are using kexec to run kernel over network. That's how our (local) lab
infrastructure looks like. Basically what we need is to be able to test
drivers on SUT as a primary concern here.

...

Yes, that's usual (historical) way for quirks on x86.

Huh?! No way, we have a (1st) kernel platform agnostic. This will make it board
dependent. Moreover, second kernel needs to be *heavily* patched for this.
It's way to nowhere.

I didn't get a sarcasm in above few paragraphs, but we are living in ideal
world, you know...

So, I will rebase and submit a new version of the series with extended commit
message. Problem is there and should be addressed.

Thanks!
