Right, it's true that they are only affected when tracing.


That said, AFAICT the accounting nests correctly. Consider:

  irq_enter() @t0
    irq_enter() @t1
    ...
    irq_exit() @t2
  irq_exit() @t3

Entering irqtime_account_irq() at time t, we get something like:

  delta = t - irq_start_time;
  irq_start_time = t;

  if (hardirq_count())
          total += delta;

Since we go through the accounting on both irq_enter() and irq_exit(), we'd
have something like:

  irq_enter() @t0
    irq_start_time = t0

  irq_enter() @t1
    delta = t1 - t0
    irq_start_time = t1
    total += t1 - t0

  irq_exit() @t2
    delta = t2 - t1
    irq_start_time = t2
    total += t2 - t1

  irq_exit() @t3
    delta = t3 - t2
    irq_start_time = t3
    total += t3 - t2


So at the end we have incremented the total by

  t1-t0 + t2-t1 + t3-t2 = t3 - t0

IOW the duration of the outermost pair (... Unless I goofed up).
