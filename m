The problem you're seeing was mentioned in the cover letter,
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-m68k/cover.1593318192.git.fthain@telegraphics.com.au/

Since this series was merged, Linus' tree is no longer compatible with 
long-standing QEMU bugs.

The best way to fix this is to upgrade QEMU (latest is 5.1.0-rc3). Or use 
the serial console instead of the framebuffer console.

I regret the inconvenience but the alternative was worse: adding code to 
Linux to get compatibility with QEMU bugs (which were added to QEMU due to 
Linux bugs).

My main concern is correct operation on actual hardware, as always. But 
some QEMU developers are working on support for operating systems besides 
Linux.

Therefore, I believe that both QEMU and Linux should aim for compatibility 
with actual hardware and not bug compatibility with each other.
