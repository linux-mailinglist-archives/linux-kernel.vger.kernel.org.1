How?  The tty lock is held in install, and should not conflict with
open(), otherwise we would be seeing this happen in all tty drivers,
right?

What data is being set that hvc_open is checking?

And you are not grabbing a lock in your install callback, you are only
serializing your open call here, I don't see how this is fixing anything
other than perhaps slowing down your codepaths.

As an arument why this isn't correct, can you answer why this same type
of change wouldn't be required for all tty drivers in the tree?
