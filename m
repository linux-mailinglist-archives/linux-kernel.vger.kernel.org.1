regression from what?

I'm confused. What happen actually? Now looks like you are saying the
issue is extending size beyond limit. But previously it said the corruption.

Are you saying "beyond that limit" is the fs corruption?

I.e. did you met real directory corruption? or you are trying to limit
because slowness on big directory?

So what was the root cause of slowness on big directory?

Thanks.
