The IOC bit. You can check the programming guide for more detail on how=20
to setup the TRBs, but what we have in dwc3 is fine.

Do you need SG? What size does video class driver setup its isoc URB? If=20
it's superspeed, max is 48K, and depending on the type of platform=20
you're running UVC on, you can setup a single 48K buffer per request if=20
you want to do that. However, it's probably not a good idea since many=20
host controllers can't even handle even close to 48K/uframe.

What I was saying is if UVC knows when to wait for the next video data,=20
it can tell dwc3 to stop the isoc endpoint before queuing the next video=20
data in a set of requests. If UVC doesn't know that, then it needs to=20
tell dwc3 to change its handling of isoc requests.

You should check the pending list too and either drop them or prepare=20
those requests (maybe too late). This happens when there's no available=20
TRB but UVC queues more requests.
Also, make sure this change only applies for isoc.

This may work. Just keep in mind that the timing parameter of the=20
XferNotReady will be expired by the time the UVC queues the next isoc=20
request. (Maybe that's why you tried to check for the current frame=20
number via DSTS instead in your first patch?).
With the new changes in Felipe testing/next branch, this may be ok.

Any time you see missed_isoc, you have data dropped. May want to check=20
to see what's going on.
