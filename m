yeah not every parameter can be coded and we should use compatible as
well, but I would disagree with no future revision planned. It will
happen not now, but sometime in year or so :) Been around devices has
taught me that only constant thing is change in hardware!

Yes but this is not a deal breaker atm, will leave upto you

yeah maybe that was a wrong choice of term, I guess update looks best.
We really are missing update api in kernel! I see regmap does provide
_update_bits() api
