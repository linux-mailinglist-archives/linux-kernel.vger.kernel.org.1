Tested-by: Bin Lu <Bin.Lu@arm.com> (for gVisor)

I have just tested all gVisor syscall test cases with ptrace(Regs, FPRegs, TLS)
on Arm64 platform.
The test results are the same as before there was no patch.

My idea is that this kernel patch has no bad effects on gVisor.
Linux Kernel version: 5.7.0-rc6+
gVisor version: release-20200511.0
