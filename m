Yes please. Also please drop the reference to kernel test robot as you
are not fixing an issue in the kernel that the robot reported (perhaps
you had a warning from the robot about the patch itself, this is
called a review and we usually don't get credited for that, at least
not with a misleading reported-by tag).

Thanks,
