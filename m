Perhaps I should have used the word regression rather than bug. I didn't buy the machine until earlier this year, but
other people who have reported this problem have indicated that until bede03a579b3 was applied (during the 5.1 merge
window), the driver supported the card reader on this on the Intel NUC boxes. I know that is true because I built and
tested a 5.0 kernel and the card reader worked fine. I've also built and tested an 5.1-rc1 kernel and the card reader no
longer works. Whether by design or by accident, the card reader worked and now it doesn't. That's a regression in my book!

Since you signed off the patch that caused the regression, I believe it is your bug.

Thanks.

Chris
