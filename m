This is true for a generic USB-UART board or cable, but not for a
dedicated PCB where both the USB-UART chip and the special connection
are implemented and which has a dedicated VID:PID different from any
generic one. In this case the VID:PID describes the whole board.

If the line-wiggling requirement is created behind some sort of
connector (real RS-232 DB9/DB25 or CMOS pin header or whatever)
then the problem is the same as for an 8250 on any other bus. For
this situation I would prefer the O_DIRECT flag on open().
