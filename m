I'm not going to give precise numbers on near future systems but it is public
that we ship 8 NUMA node ARM64 systems today.  Things will get more
interesting as CXL and CCIX enter the market on ARM systems,
given chances are every CXL device will look like another NUMA
node (CXL spec says they should be presented as such) and you
may be able to rack up lots of them.

So I'd argue minimum that makes sense today is 16 nodes, but looking forward
even a little and 64 is not a great stretch.
I'd make the jump to 64 so we can forget about this again for a year or two.
People will want to run today's distros on these new machines and we'd
rather not have to go around all the distros asking them to carry a patch
increasing this count (I assume they are already carrying such a patch
due to those 8 node systems)
