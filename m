That CMA has to be pre-reserved, right? That requires a configuration.

I was not talking about how easy or hard it is. My main concern is that
this is effectively a pre-reserved pool and a global knob is a very
suboptimal way to control access to it. I (rather) strongly believe this
should be an explicit opt-in and ideally not 1GB specific but rather
something to allow large pages to be created as there is a fit. See
other subthread for more details.
