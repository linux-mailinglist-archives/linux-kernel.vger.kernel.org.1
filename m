Subject: [PATCH v6 0/7] arm_pmu: Use NMI for perf interrupt
Date:   Wed, 19 Aug 2020 14:34:12 +0100

The series makes the arm_pmu driver use NMIs for the perf interrupt when
NMIs are available on the platform (currently, only arm64 + GICv3). To make
it easier to play with the patches, I've pushed a branch at [1]:

$ git clone -b pmu-nmi-v6 git://linux-arm.org/linux-ae

I've tested the series on an espressobin v7*. These are the results of
running perf record -a -- sleep 60:

1. Without the patches:

    16.73%  [k] arch_local_irq_enable
    12.20%  [k] arch_cpu_idle
     8.61%  [k] _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore
     4.09%  [k] arch_local_irq_enable
     2.25%  [k] arch_local_irq_enable
     1.82%  [k] arch_counter_get_cntpct
     [..]

2. Using NMIs:

     3.37%  [k] arch_counter_get_cntpct
     2.62%  [.] _IO_fwrite
     1.62%  [.] __gconv_transform_ascii_internal
     1.49%  [.] __mbrtowc
     1.44%  [k] el0_svc_common
     1.31%  [.] strchr
     [..]

When running perf record -a -- iperf3 -c 127.0.0.1 -t 60:

1. Without the patches:
    24.25%  [k] __arch_copy_from_user
    20.94%  [k] __arch_copy_to_user
     5.71%  [k] arch_local_irq_enable
     3.12%  [k] _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore
     2.01%  [k] __free_pages_ok
     1.48%  [k] arch_cpu_idle
     [..]

2. Using NMIs:

    23.15%  [k] __arch_copy_from_user
    21.68%  [k] __arch_copy_to_user
     1.23%  [k] tcp_ack
     1.08%  [k] tcp_sendmsg_locked
     0.97%  [k] rmqueue
     0.91%  [k] __free_pages_ok
     [..]

I've ran the same tests in a VM when both host+guest use NMIs, and when
neither use them. All of these tests were also ran on the model.  Similar
results in all cases.

* All the firmware versions for espressobin v7 that I've tried clear
SCR_EL3.FIQ, which means that NMIs don't work. To make them work on the
board, I modified the GICv3 driver. That's why I would really appreciate
someone testing this series on a board where NMIs work without any GIC
changes. For people who want to test the series, but don't have a board
with firmware that sets SCR_EL3.FIQ, I've pushed a branch [2] with the
GICv3 drivers changes necessary to make NMIs work:

$ git clone -b pmu-nmi-v6-nmi-fiq-clear-v2 git://linux-arm.org/linux-ae

Summary of the patches:
* Patch 1 is a fix for a bug that Julien found during the review for v4.
* Patches 2 and 3 remove locking from arm64 perf event code.
* Patches 4 and 5 makes the arm64 PMU interrupt handler NMI safe.
* Patches 6 and 7 enable the use of NMIs on arm64 with a GICv3 irqchip.

Changes since v5 [3]:
- Rebased on top of v5.9-rc1.
- Typo fixes.
- Added comments to the ISB added by patches #1 and #2.
- Reworded message for patch #4, as per Mark's excellent suggestion.

Changes since v4 [4]:
- Rebased on top of v5.8-rc1 and dropped the Tested-by tags because it's
  been almost a year since the series has been tested.
- Dropped patch 3 because I couldn't find any instance where
  armv7pmu_read_counter() was called with interrupts enabled. I've also
  tested this by running several instances of perf for a few hours, and the
  function was called every time with interrupts disabled.
- Dropped patches 4 and 5 because the tradeoff wasn't worth it in my
  opinion: the irq handler was slower all the time (because it
  saved/restored the counter select register), in exchange for being
  slightly faster on the rare ocassions when it triggered at the beginning
  of the critical sections.
- Minor changes here and there to address review comments.

Changes since v3 [5]:
- Added tags
- Fix build issue for perf_event_v6
- Don't disable preemption in pmu->enable()
- Always rely on IPI_IRQ_WORK to run the queued work
- Fixed typos + cleanups

Changes since v2 [6]:
- Rebased on recent linux-next (next-20190708)
- Fixed a number of bugs with indices (reported by Wei)
- Minor style fixes

Changes since v1 [7]:
- Rebased on v5.1-rc1
- Pseudo-NMI has changed a lot since then, use the (now merged) NMI API
- Remove locking from armv7 perf_event
- Use locking only in armv6 perf_event
- Use direct counter/type registers insted of selector register for armv8
