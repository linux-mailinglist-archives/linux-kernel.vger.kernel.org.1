Hi Prashant,
I do not think it is present. Thinking about it, I do not think it
shall be an issue on any released device as it will have either a
firmware which wouldn't even trigger the typec probe or the one after
the hierarchy fix. Likely I just got a firmware which was somewhere in
between those two (As I did some unrelated FW testing). So, yes,
probably putting this upstream is not necessary, though IMO more
sanity checks - especially on non-critical run-once paths - are always
better than having a kernel panic lingering around the corner, not
like I am insisting on pushing the patch though with all the info, up
to Enric.
Cheers,
Daniil
