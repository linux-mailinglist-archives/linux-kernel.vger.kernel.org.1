Yeah, I'd admit that I'm terrible at naming. :)
I'm open to any suggestions as I'm also bad at making new syntax..

But as Ian said, my approach takes care of the common case
without dealing with controversial syntax changes.

I don't follow.  Do you mean like when -G option and --multiply-cgroup option
is used at the same time?  Or when -G option doesn't match to -e option?

Yes, I'm also interested in improving that too.
