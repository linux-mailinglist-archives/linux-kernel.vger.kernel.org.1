OK, sounds good.  As per out-of-band conversation:

* You'll plan to post a patch updating the flag.

* There's still nothing here that says my patch is the wrong thing to
do also.  It seems like genpd poweroff routine are expected to be able
to run at "noirq" time so we should make sure we are able to do that.

I'm also curious: my patch doesn't affect the behavior.  The genpd
would be powered off with or without my patch, my patch just removes a
pointless 1 second delay.  Therefore I guess today there is some type
of bug because the genpd is being turned off.  What would be the
visible impact of that bug?  ...or is it somehow masked by something
else keeping this power on so it wasn't an issue right now?
