Sorry for the very late report.  It turns out that if your config
tickles __builtin_constant_p just right, this now produces invalid
assembly:

$ cat foo.c
long a(long b, long c) {
  asm("orb\t%1, %0" : "+q"(c): "r"(b));
  return c;
}
$ gcc foo.c
foo.c: Assembler messages:
foo.c:2: Error: `%rax' not allowed with `orb'

The "q" constraint only has meanting on -m32 otherwise is treated as
"r".

Since we have the mask (& 0xff), can we drop the `b` suffix from the
instruction? Or is a revert more appropriate? Or maybe another way to
skin this cat?

This is blowing up our KernelCI reports.
