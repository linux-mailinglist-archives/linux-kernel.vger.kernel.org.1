Yeah, this may be me not understanding something right, I saw this was a
corner case, that only happens in debug mode (ok, better provide good
info here...), so I haven't devoted more than cursory attention to this
and may be making a bad judgement, so I thought that since this doesn't
seems urgent, better leave it to when I manage to have solid time to
devote to this or someone else looks at this.

Sorry, but these have been difficult time for everybody, and I fear, for
me, I have to prioritise all the time.
