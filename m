Can we have those subtle differences documented please?

I was quite surprised that the patch is so simple TBH. For some reason
I've still had memories that we do not account for root memcg (likely
because mem_cgroup_is_root(memcg) bail out in the try_charge. But stats
are slightly different here. I have started looking at different stat
counters because they are not really all the same. E.g. 
- mem_cgroup_charge_statistics accounts for each memcg
- memcg_charge_kernel_stack relies on pages being associated with a
  memcg and that in turn relies on __memcg_kmem_charge_page which bails
  out on root memcg
- memcg_charge_slab (NR_SLAB*) skips over root memcg as well
- __mod_lruvec_page_state relies on page->mem_cgroup as well but this
  one is ok for paths which go through commit_charge path.

That being said we should really double check which stats are
accounted properly. At least MEMCG_KERNEL_STACK_KB won't unless I am
misreading the code.

I do not mind displaying the root's memcg stats but a) a closer look had
to be done for each counter and b) a clarification of differences from
the global vmstat counters would be really handy.
