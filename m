Okay, then please add a line saying that there will be separate chardev nodes
for each channel specified.

Yes, just add couple of examples.

Okay. The naming conventions used in MHI are a bit weird. So from the start
itself I stuck with some fixed names and client is one of them. The term client
itself refers to both client device and a driver used to talk to the device in
the host. So we should explicitly mention if it is a userspace client driver
or the client device.
