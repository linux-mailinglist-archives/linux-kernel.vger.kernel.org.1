No, it doesn't help at all with figuring out if consumers will ever
instantiate...

=2E..due to this issue.  The DT describes the hardware, not the software
that will run on it.  Making the timeout configurable is fine.

This still leaves you with the problem that we're going to just ignore
operations that happen while implementation of operations is blocked.
If we queue up actually implementing changes to the hardware until after
we claimed we'd done them then that's asking for trouble, especally with
voltage changes - they need to be complete when regulator_set_voltage()
returns, we can't defer syncing that to the hardware to some later
point.=20

Actually now I try to make sense of the code I *think* that rather than
holding off on writing changes out like sync_state() and your changelog
suggests this is only trying to defer disables.  That's a bit safer
but then again it won't help as soon as we run into a system with a
device that glitches due to some other change like a voltage being
changed unexpectedly and it's adding complexity.  The entire patch is
super unclear though, I can't understand what sync_supply is supposed to
be.  It appears to functionally just be a flag but it's done using this
weirdly allocated and manipulated struct regulator.

Drivers can be run on multiple systems, this is not a decision that can
be made based on the driver.

We do gradual API updates when there are actual changes required in
drivers.  This change requires *zero* changes to drivers, there is
absolutely nothing driver specific or relevant about it.  Nothing about
the driver tells you if the flag should be set or not (it's a callback
in the code but since there's only one possible implementation it's
really a flag) so there's no purpose in having a flag in the driver in
the first place.

The first hits I found were:

   https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/1368076726-11492-1-git-send-ema=
il-skannan@codeaurora.org/#t
   https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CAKON4OzO427-MU4FqmF8AP5V=3DCXH=
uGdV1GTptiaJiRY7DLfDRA@mail.gmail.com/

Search around for deferred initcall, regulator_late_init() and so on.
Please also talk to your colleagues, IIRC a good proportion of the
variations on this have come from them.

You haven't mentioned an actual use case here (your changelog just
declares the solution) but in general these things are init ordering
issues, if some device (typically the display stuff) is going to cause
user visible glitches during init then things will work best if the
system tries to ensure that that device gets started as early as
possible.  In general these things are best addressed at the system
level rather than by bodging some low level thing.
