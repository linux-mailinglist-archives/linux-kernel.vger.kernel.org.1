I don't think this series changes anything. There is no easy way to
reserve SGIs in a way that would work for all combination of OS and FW,
and the prospect of sending SGIs between S and NS has already been
dubious (yes, the GIC architecture allows it, but it has been written
by people who have never designed any large piece of SW).

Thanks,

	M.
