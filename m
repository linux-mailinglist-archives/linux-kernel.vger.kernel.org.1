I'm confused now - there is no "SMMU callback", we're talking about the 
system-wide cleanup from kernel_shutdown_prepare() or 
kernel_restart_prepare(). As far as I'm aware userspace should be long 
gone by that point, so although trace may have been left running, the 
chance of racing against other driver operations seems pretty unlikely.
