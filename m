Thanks, I did not noticed that ! If I understand, this will require to modify
the core to handle sector size the same way as page_size and probably add a
fixup to detect the "K" options from SFDP ?
This is probably more changes than I can handle, and you can probably drop this
patch since not really functional for "K" type flash.

But thanks for noticing it !
