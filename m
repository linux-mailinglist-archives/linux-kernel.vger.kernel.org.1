I would not be inclined to lean towards either approach for NUMA
balancing. Fiddling with the accessed bit can have consequences for page
aging and residency -- fine for debugging a problem, not to fine for
normal usage. I would expect the PMU approach would have high overhead
as well as taking over a PMU counter that userspace debugging may expect
to be available.
