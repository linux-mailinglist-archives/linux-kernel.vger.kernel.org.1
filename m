If the fd isn't writable (or may not be writable), mnt_want_write_file() is
needed.  That includes all ioctls that operate (or may operate) on directories,
since directories can't be opened for writing.

But when the fd is guaranteed to be writable, incrementing mnt_writers is
pointless.  I'm trying to clean this up in the VFS:
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200611160534.55042-1-ebiggers@kernel.org.

mnt_want_write_file() still does the freeze protection, which file_start_write()
achieves more directly.

The only other thing that mnt_want_write_file() does is the check for emergency
remount r/o, which I doubt is very important.  It's racy, so the filesystem
needs to detect it in other places too.

I'm not sure why file_update_time() uses __mnt_want_write_file().  Either it
assumes the fd might not be writable, or it just wants the check for emergency
remount r/o, or it's just a mistake.  Note also that mtime isn't always updated,
so just because file_update_time() calls __mnt_want_write_file() doesn't mean
that write() always calls __mnt_want_write_file().
