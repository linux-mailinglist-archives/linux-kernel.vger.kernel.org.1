Yeah that's my understanding too.

Christophe is the expert on that code so I'll defer to him if I'm wrong.

I think we can do something to make it work.

We don't have an equivalent of x86's ex_handler_uaccess(), so it's not
quite as easy as whacking a user_access_end() in there.

Probably the simplest option for us is to just handle it in our
unsafe_op_wrap(). I'll try and come up with something tomorrow.
