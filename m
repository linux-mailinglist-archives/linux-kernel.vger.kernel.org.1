Sorry i missed this and some associated discussion in V2...

I have also some concerns about the ABI breaks.
In ST and I suppose in several companies we have some 
test environments that use the debugfs to generate and/or get
the core dump.

Even if the stability of the debugfs is not guaranteed it would
be nice to keep both interface.

It seems that it is possible to create symbolic link in the debugfs
thanks to the "debugfs_create_symlink" function.
This seems allowing to keep files in both place without duplicating the code.
To be honest i have never used this function so I'm not 100% sure that this
would do the job...
But if you think that this could be a good compromise, i can test it.

Regards,
Arnaud
