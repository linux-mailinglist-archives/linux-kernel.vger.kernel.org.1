So I'm not opposed to this, but I'm missing a couple of things in the
changelog:

 - A statement that you are adding a -Werror option that invokes this
   behavior.

 - Mention of the fact that you also cause it to look at a couple of
   environment variables and change its behavior based on that.

Could I get a version with that clarified a bit?

Thanks,
