I *think* you're right. E.g., when we're allocating vpe_table_mask for
the first CPU of the second CommonLPIAff group.

The truth is that all the GICv4.1 boards I'm having on hand only have a
single CommonLPIAff group. Just to get the above backtrace, I did some
crazy hacking on my 920 and pretend it as v4.1 capable (well, please
ignore me). Hopefully I can get a new GICv4.1 board with more than one
CommonLPIAff group next month and do more tests.

Got it.

Yes, I had written something like below. I will add a commit message and
send it out today.
