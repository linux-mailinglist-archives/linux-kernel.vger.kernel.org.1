It is in active use. Please do not act on such a request. I would be
much quicker to ack things that actually need ack if I weren't CC'd on
hundreds of random non-arch-specific changes that don't need it, but I
understand that's how the kernel process works. If there are things
that need ack please feel free to ping.

Note that I specifically acked and requested the sh5 removal.
