Hi,

I've repeatedly stared at an SD flag and asked myself "how should that be
set up in the domain hierarchy anyway?". I figured that if we formalize our
flags zoology a bit, we could also do some runtime assertions on them -
this is what this series is all about.

Patches
=======

The idea is to associate the flags with a metatype that describes how they
should be set in a sched domain hierarchy - details are in the comments and
commit logs. For now it's just a simple parent/children relationship
description ("if this SD has it, all its {parents, children} have it").

The good thing is that this all goes away when CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG isn't
set. The bad thing is that replaces SD_* flags definitions with some
unsavoury macros. This is mainly because I wanted to avoid having to
duplicate work between declaring the flags and declaring their metatypes.

There's also the removal of yet another SD flag (SD_SHARE_POWERDOMAIN).

Some deltas
===========

This time around it's a slight size increase (w/o SCHED_DEBUG): 

  $ compare.sh before after vmlinux.o
  cpu_attach_domain                                         996       1000   +4
  build_sched_domains                                      4716       4728   +12

Comparing the objdumps side by side, nothing obvious stands out to me.

Revisions
=========

RFC -> v2
---------

RFC at: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200311183320.19186-1-valentin.schneider@arm.com

o Rebased on top of tip/sched/core
o Aligned wording of comments between flags
o Rectified some flag descriptions (Morten)
o Added removal of SD_SHARE_POWERDOMAIN (Morten)

Cheers,
Valentin
