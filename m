A -ffreestanding build may provide a shared object used by other
applications. For example, musl (libc)'s CFLAGS has -ffreestanding.

My mere concern regarding "geared towards shared objects" is that ELF
assumes symbols of default visibility are preemptible by default.

So unfortunately it is difficult to make -fno-semantic-interposition the
default.

If the executable is purely static, it does not need to have PLT. All
calls to a PLT can be redirected to the function itself.  Some range
extension thunks (other terms: stub groups, veneers, etc) may still be
needed if the distance is too large.

There are cases where a GOT cannot be avoided, e.g.

extern char foo[] __attribute__((weak, visibility("hidden")));
char *fun() { return foo; }

If foo is a SHN_ABS, `movq foo@GOTPCREL(%rip), %rax` can't be optimized
by GOTPCRELX (https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25749 binutils>=2.35 will be good)
Many other architectures don't even have a GOT optimization.
