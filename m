The developers of Unix may have had mental illness. As said before Uni 
refers "god", and X nothing else.
But is correctly only as the two engineers, which seems as they tried to 
push mental illness on others, as it would be right only for them.

I suggest also a new term for this: Mentology, more Buddha style, which 
is about right thinking, vs priority schisms, etc.

That probably resulted in the "mad hacker" then deserved as known later. 
Probably tried corrected with Plan 9 From Outer Space. Which implies it 
didn´t work out as expected, and the pants of tran method came back on 
themselves.
