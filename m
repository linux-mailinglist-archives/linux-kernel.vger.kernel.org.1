DST switching is a matter of switching time zones and has absolutely
nothing to do with frequencies. In fact smearing DST is a blantant
violation of the timekeeping guarantees.

I've never heard about that before. All I know is that chronyd can be
configured to smear leap seconds, but that doesn't take 6 hours and does
not screw with the time accuracy in the range of 20 minutes.

Of course not, but the kernel relies on that application behaving
sanely. If it does not then the time stamps you are complaining about
are the least of your worries.

And how do you make CLOCK_BOOTTIME_RAW accurate? The clock hardware
can stop accross suspend/resume and the kernel then uses RTC or some
other hardware to inject the sleep time. That injection is not and
cannot be correct vs. the raw clock.

So exposing CLOCK_BOOTTIME_RAW would just provide yet another illusion
of time.
