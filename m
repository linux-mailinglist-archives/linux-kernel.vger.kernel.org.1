Can thread spraying (which allocates lots of large memory blocks) be 
caught by limiting the total address space used by the process via 
cgroup controls and resource limits (for example, systemd directives 
MemoryMax= and LimitAS=)?

(Reading this pre-Spectre paper gave me the same feeling as looking at 
some pre-Covid stuff: the world was so much simpler back then.)
