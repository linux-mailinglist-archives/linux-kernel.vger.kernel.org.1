Another option; if the add-on board PCB really doesn't do anything
except provide some copper lines to the on-board components, then does
it need representing in Device Tree at all?  I suggest not.

Your issue will come when you want to swap out that board and insert
another, which contains different functionality.  This is why it would
be better to represent the whole board as an orthogonal *.dts file.
Whether you decide to lay it out as it's own board (as above) or as
children to the system-bus will be up to you.
