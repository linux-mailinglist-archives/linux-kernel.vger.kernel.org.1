Actually, in all my stress testing (where I also add nested
trace_printk()s to read what is happening), I was never once able to
trigger the zero delta path! I only tested it by adding code to inject
the event to force the given race condition.

Note, zero deltas are still there between absolute time stamps and
start of page, but that's still different than a zero delta from the
previous event.
