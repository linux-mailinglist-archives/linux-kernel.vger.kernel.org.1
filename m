We certainly discussed the possiblity of adding an error code to 
identiy #GP due to ENQCMD with our HW architects. 

There are only a few cases that have an error code, like move to segment
with an invalid value for instance. There were a few but i don't
recall that entire list. 

Since the error code is 0 in most places, there isn't plumbing in hw to return
this value in all cases. It appeared that due to some uarch reasons it
wasn't as simple as it appears to /me sw kinds :-)

So after some internal discussion we decided to take the current
approach. Its possible that if the #GP was due to some other reason
we might #GP another time. Since this wasn't perf or speed path we took
this lazy approach. 

We will keep tabs with HW folks for future consideration.
