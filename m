Ok, doing the revert is fine with me, I've prepped it and I will
send it out right away.

Note the commit does not break anything; it even works as advertised
to fix the camera LED being stuck in on state at boot on the Asus T100TA
and Asus T200TA.

The problem is that I'm working on making various 2-in-1s report their
tablet-mode state (SW_TABLET_MODE) to userspace; and I've found that
these 2 Asus models (and other Asus models) report this through WMI.

So the blacklisting of these 2 models inside asus-nb-wmi needs to be
dropped to make the SW_TABLET_MODE reporting work once I have added that
to the asus-nb-wmi driver, so the revert is to prepare for that it
does not fix any regression, since the current version of asus-nb-wmi
does not handle SW_TABLET_MODE.

So there is no need to rush the revert upstream, it can go to 5.8 together
with the asus-nb-wmi changes to add SW_TABLET_MODE support.

The reason I was asking to drop the commit was because I came to the
conclusion that in the end the blacklist is not what we want. But for
now having the blacklist is fine.

Regards,

Hans
