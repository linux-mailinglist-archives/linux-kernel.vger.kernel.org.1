I'm using existing code to illustrate the problem with your idea of
"sparse-clean" new code, trying to show you that it is not about
being sparse clean, but about being correct.

Right, but if you lay down a rule that says "new submissions must be
sparse clean" you will get people using __force to shut sparse up.
