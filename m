So.. just as a heads up, this is a fairly old version of this patch. I
have the current version here:
  https://git.linaro.org/people/john.stultz/android-dev.git/commit/?h=dev/hikey960-mainline-WIP&id=1155346a06472177b8a7e7918de052549916f06f

So you may want to rework ontop of that.

That said, the last time I submitted the hub/mux driver, Rob pushed
back suggesting that the vbus, switch and hub power should probably be
DT describable:
  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191218163738.GA12358@bogus/

I'm at the point where I probably don't have additional cycles to
spend to rework all the supporting drivers to support such a DT
binding, so I'm not very optimistic this patch will go upstream (its
much easier to float the current hub/mux driver).  So you may want to
focus on Rob's feedback there rather than any of my feedback here. :)

So, it might not be too hard to rework the hikey960 hub power gpio to
a gpio-regulator binding, and then both platforms can use the same
code?

You might be able to put this reset pin under the dwc3 resets?

Not sure about the hub keyboard mouse issue. I worry that may be an
issue with the hub power not being on?
Make sure the mux driver is in the expected state when you boot up and
switch modes.

I suspect you can drop the dwc3-hisi glue code once you move the clks
and resets to the dwc3 node directly, as we did for hikey960.
