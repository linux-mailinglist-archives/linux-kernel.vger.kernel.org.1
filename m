Right.  This is just an example to express the problem more easily.

"works" it a matter of opinion.  Some instances "work" out of luck.
Some "work" because they have been worked-around or an alternative
implementation sought.

For instance, 'ab8500-pwm' only has 1 DT node present, yet 3 devices
are registered via MFD.  Since MFD matches devices with DT nodes
containing identical compatible strings using first-found, all PWM
instances are assigned a pointer to the 1 existing DT node.
Fortunately in this case they all share the same clock, so it "works",
but that's clearly not the intended implementation.

All agreed.  Sounds promising.

If it's always possible to have a 'reg' property then we won't need
to.

Let me try and knock something up.

I'll get back to you when it's done.
