OK. What if we do make the new call but only for the card readers that are in the A series? Are they the ones that have
PID_5nnn defines in include/linux/rtsx_pci.h? Or is there another simple way of identifying that a reader is a member of
the A series?

I'm thinking of something like:
static bool rtsx_pci_is_series_A(pcr)
{
	unsigned short device = pcr->pci->device;

	return device == PID524A || device == PID_5249 || device == PID_5250 || device == PID_525A
			|| device == PID_525A || device == PID_5260 || device == PID_5261;
}

then in rtsx_pci_init_hw() change the unconditional call to:

	if rtsx_pci_is_series_A(pcr)
		rtsx_pci_init_ocp();

Does that seem OK?
