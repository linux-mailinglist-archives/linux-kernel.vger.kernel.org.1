My remark above should have been more precise in this regard:

privcmd operations dealing with foreign mappings are normally limited
to dom0 (there might be special cases, like linux-based stubdoms, but
those will be configured carefully for that purpose, so they don't
need to be considered for selecting the default IMO).

Yes.

I'd prefer a resend (maybe after Patch 1 has gained its missing Ack, and
then with Patch 1 sent to me, too).
