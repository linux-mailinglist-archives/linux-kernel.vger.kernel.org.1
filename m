true

However, it's still using the cluster readahead because I'm using a
swap file and nr_rotate_swap=1, so, according to the following, it's
never using the vma readahead:

 static inline bool swap_use_vma_readahead(void)
 {
         return READ_ONCE(enable_vma_readahead) && !atomic_read(&nr_rotate_swap);
 }

I'll investigate more on this, I think there's no reason to prevent the
usage of vma readahead if the underlying device is non-rotational.

This is what I was missing! Sorry about that, I was still calling
swapin_readahead() even if the page was already in case, that was
unnecessary overhead and it was messing up the hit ratio!

With lookup_swap_cache() applied properly eveything looks way better:

r::swapin_nr_pages(unsigned long offset):unsigned long:$retval
	COUNT      EVENT
	378        $retval = 1
	2138       $retval = 2
	25365      $retval = 4
	105314     $retval = 8

swapof time: 9.87s

So, basically it gives the same performance result of my fixed-size
approach, but it's definitely a better and cleaner solution.

Just to make it clear, here's the patch that I applied (if it looks good
to you I can send another version with a better description):
