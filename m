1 << 20 ?

Anyway I was getting this:
not ok 1 test_kmem_basic
ok 2 test_kmem_memcg_deletion
ok 3 test_kmem_proc_kpagecgroup
not ok 4 test_kmem_kernel_stacks
ok 5 test_kmem_dead_cgroups

Adding some debugging into kmem_basic I found I get memory.stat == 0 at this
point thus it fails the fixed test (otherwise it was failing the <= 0 test after
writing to memory.high). But it's just a VM spinned by virtme which has a very
simple init, so perhaps things are not as initialized as expected.
