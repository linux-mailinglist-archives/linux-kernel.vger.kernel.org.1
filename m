Yes, exactly.

Well, sort of: every place that acquires a new reference *and then
performs I/O* needs a make_page_accessible().  There seem to be a
lot of plain get_page() calls that aren't related to I/O.

This is indeed interesting.  In particular if you compare try_get_page
with try_get_compound_head in gup.c, which does instead:

        if (WARN_ON_ONCE(page_ref_count(head) < 0))
                return NULL;

which seems more reasonable to me, given the presence of the
page_ref_freeze method.  So I'm not sure why try_get_page has <= 0.

I think I understand why we haven't seen this in testing: all the
places in gup.c where try_get_page is called hold the pte lock;
and in the usual case, the pte lock itself already suffices to
lock out make_secure_pte before it even tries to use page_ref_freeze.
(The intent of holding the pte lock there was really to ensure that
the PTE entry is and remains valid throughout the execution of
the ultravisor call, which will look at the PTE entry.)

However, I guess we could construct cases where the pte lock doesn't
suffice to prevent the try_get_page warning: if we create a shared
mapping of the secure guest backing store file into a second process.
That doesn't ever happen in normal qemu operation, so that's likely
why we haven't seen that case.

Not sure if you can really call this an "audit", but we were really
coming from identifying places where I/O can happen on a page cache
page, and everything we found (except writeback) went through gup.
We obviously missed the sendfile case here; not sure what the best
way would be to verify nothing else was missed.

Yes, exactly.  That's what comment ahead of our arch_make_page_accesible
says: To be called with the page locked or with an extra reference!
(Either is enough to lock out make_secure_pte.)
