The thing here is, there is no Ack, or at least my irqchips are not getting
the irq_ack() callback, which is where I was expecting to clear the doorbel=
l.

The hardware is really simple. On the MSI controller (GICP) side, each
interrupt only has 3 registers: 1 status, 1 mask and 1 clear. When an
MSI lands a write on the status register, it asserts the interrupt line.
The interrupt stays asserted until we clear the status (using the clear
register). The mask register is just to enable the interrupt basically.
The MSI data is really irrelevant, as long as it's non-zero we always
obtain the same result.

On the MSI client side, we only configure the MSI address and data for
a certain device interrupt line, and for each rising edge, an MSI gets issu=
ed.

Well, the solution I have now works perfectly for the configuration, becaus=
e
the MSIC gets configured by msi_compose_msg -> msi_write_msg at IRQ
allocation time and never gets touched again.

Then when the IRQ gets activated, the GICP is unmasking the interrupt but
enabling the doorbell (setting the mask register).

The only thing I really need is to intercept every MSI before the handler s=
o
I can Ack it by clearing the doorbell status register.

Let me know if that is good enough information. There's really not much on
the HW side.

Thanks,
