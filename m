We can design SBI calls such that no SBI call is required to read
the perf counter.

The sbi_probe_extension() will only be used to check whether
underlying SBI implementation supports SBI PMU extension.

As-per my initial thoughts, we can potentially have the following SBI calls:

1. SBI_PMU_NUM_COUNTERS
    This call will return the number of SBI PMU counters
2. SBI_PMU_COUNTER_DESCRIBE
   This call takes two parameters: 1) physical address 2) counter index
    It will write the description of SBI PMU counter at specified
physical address.
    The details of the SBI PMU counter will include name, type, etc
3. SBI_PMU_COUNTER_START
    This call takes two parameters: 1) physical address 2) counter index
    It will inform SBI implementation to start counting specified counter on the
    calling HART. The counter value will be written to the specified physical
    address whenever it changes.
4. SBI_PMU_COUNTER_STOP
    This call takes one parameter: 1) counter index
    It will inform SBI implementation to stop counting specified counters on
    the calling HART.

The above calls are generic enough to support any number of counters
and we don't need any SBI call to read the counter. We can also assume
all counters to be of fixed 64bit width. In fact, even Hypervisors can support
it's own SBI PMU counters with SBI PMU extension.

We still need to think more about the above calls because above SBI
calls are just initial ideas.

Maybe you can refine the above ideas and send a proposal to the
UnixPlatformSpec mailing list ??
