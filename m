Do you have a pointer to this code?

Yes, there are extensions to directives are not a problem and parsers
might raise an error on them.  That can be an issue, but it's a separate
one (and it's easier to ignore it as long as test pass...).

Here the TAP spec says that a skip starts with "ok" and has a "SKIP"
directive, and anyone can parse it to treat as it as a failure if
desirable.  But doing something else should be treated simply as a
violation of the spec, it's not a matter of "right" or "wrong".

So, if you want to use "not ok ... # SKIP", don't call it TAP.

However, I noticed now that there is another instance of "not ok.*SKIP"
in testing/selftests/kselftest.h (and also one in a comment).  So they
should all be fixed at the same time, and I'm okay with holding this patch.
