Yes, sure. But I'm not only "researching", but using UML as a "router"
in one of my dev setups. 3363179385629c1804ea846f4e72608c2201a81e
mentions UML_NET_VECTOR incompatibility (and some other networking
options), which I had enabled and actually my whole dev networking is
based around UML_NET_VECTOR: I have two interfaces - one in raw mode
and one doing ipsec. All this was running in an empty "FROM: scratch"
container and obviously linked statically.

If the static linking breaks some other config options in allyesconfig
- that's another story, but I wanted to point out that config options
mentioned in the commit message worked just fine (if not trying to
resolve hostnames). In other words: if you don't resolve - glibc will
not try to load NSS. glibc-nss is a known problem and I would assume
most people trying to do static linking are aware of this - that is,
if they choose this path they are willing to live with the
consequences. That's why completely disabling the possibility sounds
too restrictive for me.

If I succeed linking it to musl (or other non-glibc lib), would that be enough?

As a side note: I tried to revert this patch and statically link 5.7
UML with glibc, but the binary still segfaults on start, so I would
assume it is not related to my previous attempts linking with musl.
