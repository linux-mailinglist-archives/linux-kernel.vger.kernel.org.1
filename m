Hi Mike,

Thanks for taking a look.

Yes, this probably needs further investigation, but CPU hardlock stack
trace doesnt help much. I could always trigger this hard lockup without
this patch on SC7180 SoC and this is only seen when ETR is used as the 
sink.

The only difference I could see between non working case (on SC7180 [1]) 
and
the working case (on SDM845 [2]) is the path from source to sink.

SC7180 source to sink path(Not working):
