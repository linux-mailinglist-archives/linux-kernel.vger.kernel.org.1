It's not necessarily that bad.
- if the intent is to have a single platform firmware that can deal with 
different boards, it's a good thing.
- but if it's just sloppy platform firmware that just does copy-paste 
from platform to platform then indeed it becomes a mess.

Maybe adding a device number sysfs entry would help, e.g. reporting
NotAttched or a value in [0,11] would tell you if the device is actually 
present.
