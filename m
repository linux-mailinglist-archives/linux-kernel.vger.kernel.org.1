Disregarding the name that we'd prefer, I thought the new flag should only be
used internally in GUP just like FOLL_COW, or am I wrong?

Now FOLL_BREAK_COW (or whatever we'd like to call it) is applied as long as for
FOLL_PIN and FOLL_GET irrelevant to who calls __get_user_pages().  Shouldn't
that be enough that the new flag will be applied correctly always?...

I'd be fine if you want me to rename the flag into FOLL_READ_WRONG_SIDE_COW_OK.
It's just a bit awkward to read and check, because otherwise for the COW path
we'll need to use "(FAULT_FLAG_WRITE || !FAULT_FLAG_READ_WRONG_SIDE_COW_OK)".

Yeah, that's why I totally agree we need to do enforced COW even for a read gup
as long as the page can be further referenced (GET|PIN).  However frankly
speaking I didn't follow the rest on what's wrong with "Userfaultfd-wp should
not care about this because it's not a write operation" that I mentiond.  Is
that the major part of the objection?

I'm afraid I still think that's the right thing to do...

Could you help elaborate more?  It would be better if you can help to point out
the code changes that are wrong or suspecious, maybe that'll help me to
understand what I might have missed too.

Thanks,
