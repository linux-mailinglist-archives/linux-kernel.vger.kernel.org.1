That would be the case if it didn't have the impact that they
currently do on the compaction process. What I am getting at is that a
race was introduced when you placed this test between the clearing of
the LRU flag and the actual pulling of the page from the LRU list. So
if you tested the skip bits before clearing the LRU flag then I would
be okay with the code, however because it is triggering an abort after
the LRU flag is cleared then you are creating a situation where
multiple processes will be stomping all over each other as you can
have each thread essentially take a page via the LRU flag, but only
one thread will process a page and it could skip over all other pages
that preemptively had their LRU flag cleared.

If you take a look at the test_and_set_skip the function only acts on
the pageblock aligned PFN for a given range. WIth the changes you have
in place now that would mean that only one thread would ever actually
call this function anyway since the first PFN would take the LRU flag
so no other thread could follow through and test or set the bit as
well. The expectation before was that all threads would encounter this
test and either proceed after setting the bit for the first PFN or
abort after testing the first PFN. With you changes only the first
thread actually runs this test and then it and the others will likely
encounter multiple failures as they are all clearing LRU bits
simultaneously and tripping each other up. That is why the skip bit
must have a test and set done before you even get to the point of
clearing the LRU flag.

No there are significant changes as you reordered all of the
operations. Prior to your change the LRU bit was checked, but not
cleared before testing for PageCompound. Now you are clearing it
before you are testing if it is a compound page. So if compaction is
running we will be seeing the pages in the LRU stay put, but the
compound bit flickering off and on if the compound page is encountered
with the wrong or NULL lruvec. What I was suggesting is that the
PageCompound test probably doesn't need to be concerned with the lock
after your changes. You could test it after you call
get_page_unless_zero() and before you call
__isolate_lru_page_prepare(). Instead of relying on the LRU lock to
protect us from the page switching between compound and not we would
be relying on the fact that we are holding a reference to the page so
it should not be freed and transition between compound or not.
