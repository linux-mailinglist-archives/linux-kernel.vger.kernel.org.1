Can you describe the scenario more detail?

I'm not sure I understand this patch. TPM should be in polling
mode. This is also assumption before calling tpm_get_timeouts():

/* Before doing irq testing issue a command to the TPM in polling mode
 * to make sure it works. May as well use that command to set the
 * proper timeouts for the driver.
 */
if (tpm_get_timeouts(chip)) {
        dev_err(dev, "Could not get TPM timeouts and durations\n");
        rc = -ENODEV;
        goto out_err;
}
