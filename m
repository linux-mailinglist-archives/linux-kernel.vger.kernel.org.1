To make it clear. I definitely do not want to block lockless printk by
this.

BTW: I am not 100% convinced that storing all three timestamps is
worth it. It increases the code complexity, metadata size. It needs
an interface with the userspace that has to stay backward compatible.

Also it still will be racy because the timestamp is taken when the message
is printed. It might be "long" before or after the event that
it talks about.

There is still the alternative to print all three timestamps regularly
for those interested. It is less user convenient but much easier
to maintain.

Best Regards,
Petr
