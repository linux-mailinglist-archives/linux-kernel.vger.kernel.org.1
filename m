But you didn't call it that. You called it:

get_rdtgroup_rftype_get_by_name

Two "get" and the prefix doesn't come first. So take this string
verbatim:

"rdtgroup_get_rftype_by_name"

and paste it everywhere where the function name is.

How about you slow down, do it right and then send it? It is not a
competition where the first to send, wins.

Also, pls redo the patches ontop of tip:x86/cache because there's James'
stuff there now and this one doesn't apply.

And test them again and *then* resend.

Thx.
