Sorry, if my response was too harsh.

I know.

I tried this, and then
"sudo make modules_install -C <path-to-the-kernel-build-system> M=3D$PWD"
but I did not see the issue.

So, I have no idea what the root-cause is
at this point.

Right.
External modules should never ever attempt
to modify the kernel tree since it is often read-only.

I did not change that behavior
(unless I was doing a horrible mistake)

"git bisect" is really useful to find the first bad commit.
If you have not tried it yet,
it is worth learning the usage.



Can you reproduce the issue in the linux-stable source tree
instead of the ubuntu kernel?


You can get the stable kernel repository, like follows:

$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stab=
le.git
$ cd linux-stable
$ git checkout v5.8.1


Once you find how to reproduce the bug
in the git repository,
it is pretty easy to start bisecting
with "git bisect start <bad> <good>"

For example,

git bisect start v5.8.1  v5.7.15

Then, repeat "git bisect good" or "git bisect bad",
depending on whether the bug happens.

I also use Ubuntu, but my one is 5.4.0-42-generic.


I am not sure if 5.8.1-050801-generic
is exactly the same as v5.8.1, though.

I'd like to know the steps to reproduce the bug
in the kernel source tree instead of the distro's one.
(See above to get the stable kernel tree)



We could use your project to debug this, but
if this is purely a problem of the kernel build system,
it is easier and faster to use a small hello-world module.


For example, the minimal Makefile
of an external module will look like follows:



------------------------>8---------------------------
KERNEL=3D$(HOME)/workspace/linux-stable

.PHONY: __default
__default:
        $(MAKE) -C $(KERNEL) M=3D$(CURDIR)

.PHONY: $(MAKECMDGOALS)
$(MAKECMDGOALS):
        $(MAKE) -C $(KERNEL) M=3D$(CURDIR) $@

obj-m :=3D helloworld.o
------------------------>8---------------------------

Please include both lists in To or Cc.

linux-kernel@ is a large amount.

I often miss mails if they are only
sent to linux-kernel@.




Thanks.
