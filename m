Can you please point me to the most resent version of the TF-A side
implementation of this? The i.MX8MM implementation in the
imx_5.4.3_2.0.0 branch in the codeaurora imx-atf repo still contains
writes to the clock controller register range.

Also I would love to learn why the GPC needs to access Mediamix and
VPUmix domain registers. If you are talking about the NOC configuration
I would strongly suggest that those should be handled by a Linux side
interconnect driver, this has nothing to do with the power domain
sequencing, it just happens to lose state over the power down and needs
to be reprogrammed after power on. The NOC configuration though is use-
case dependent, so this should be properly handled in a rich OS driver.

Sure we needs to extend the Linux side GPC driver for each new SoC
generation, but that's no different from any other hardware driver in
Linux. Drivers are the abstraction around the hardware, there is no
need to invent another one if there are no clear benefits.

Lucas
