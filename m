The requests coming in can have the IOCB_NOWAIT flag set or cleared.
The idea was to have an additional flag that implies IOCB_NOWAIT so
that you can do:

    iocb->ki_flags |= IOCB_NOIO;
    generic_file_read_iter()
    if ("failed because of IOCB_NOIO") {
        if ("failed because of IOCB_NOWAIT")
            return -EAGAIN;
        iocb->ki_flags &= ~IOCB_NOIO;
        "locking"
         generic_file_read_iter()
        "unlocking"
    }

without having to save iocb->ki_flags. The alternative would be:

    int flags = iocb->ki_flags;
    iocb->ki_flags |= IOCB_NOIO | IOCB_NOWAIT;
    ret = generic_file_read_iter()
    if ("failed because of IOCB_NOIO or IOCB_NOWAIT") {
        if ("failed because of IOCB_NOWAIT" && (flags & IOCB_NOWAIT))
            return -EAGAIN;
        iocb->ki_flags &= ~IOCB_NOIO;
        "locking"
         generic_file_read_iter()
        "unlocking"
    }
