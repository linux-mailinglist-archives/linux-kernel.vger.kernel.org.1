Agreed. I can't read the mind of Sibi so I can only guess that Sibi
wasn't expecting this behavior by reading the driver structure. That
could be a wrong assumption.

I'm trying to say that the driver looks like it expects to power off the
genpd in the adsp_stop() callback. That same callback sends some sort of
message to the modem saying that it is being stopped (see
qcom_q6v5_request_stop()). Turning the performance state down, or
turning the power domain off completely, without telling the modem that
it's happening like as is done in adsp_stop() looks wrong. But who
knows, maybe the modem is happy with that and doesn't care?

In general, the whole thing looks weird to me because I would expect the
modem to take care of its own power requirements, including this
"load_state" one. Anyway, I hope Sibi can clarify what's going on.
