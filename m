Then the magic number is simply confusing. The patch needs to be
a lot clearer about what the intent is if my patch that adds a "if
(env->src_stats.node_type == node_has_spare)" check is not what you were
aiming for.

The domain could be overloaded simply due to CPU bindings. I cannot
parse the ICU comment (Intensive Care Unit?!?) :(

And I don't think we should go back to the load balancer and NUMA balancer
taking different actions. It ends up doing useless CPU migrations and
can lead to higher NUMA scanning activity. It's partially why I changed
task_numa_compare to prefer swapping with tasks that move to their
preferred node when using an idle CPU would cause an imbalance.

Load balancing primarily cares about balancing the number of idle CPUs
between domains when there is spare capacity. While it tries to avoid
balancing by moving tasks from their preferred node, it will do so if
there are no other candidates.

True. While it's prefectly possible to ignore imbalance and use an idle
CPU if it exists, the load balancer will simply override it later and we
go back to the NUMA balancer and load balancer fighting each other with
the NUMA balancer retrying migrations based on p->numa_migrate_retry.
Whatever logic is used to allow imbalances (be they based on communicating
tasks or preferred locality), it needs to be the same in both balancers.
