As far as I've understood, these are two entirely different things - set 
voltage and set current limits - that's how I'm using them, exactly, and 
I'm really sure that I'm right on this.

Besides what I think, though, obviously Mark has the last word on this.

This regulator does not support setting a minimum limit, but only a 
ceiling limit, and that's used to raise an interrupt for over-current 
protection.
As far as I've understood, the Portable Batch System does its job only 
in the specific case of *short circuit* detection, but the OCP is 
totally left to the driver.

The reason why I am restricting the match in a sort of paranoid way is 
that this regulator can set the current limit in steps, but what I 
wanted to avoid was a scenario like:

- My display hardware draws a maximum of 475mA
- I set the current limit on LAB/IBB to 475mA
- The driver picks 450mA because it likes that value more
- I get Over Current Protection interrupts and I think that my hardware
   will get fried if I keep going on
- This points me to fix the display driver
   - Wrong! It was the regulator driver doing something different from
     what I asked it to.

So that's what I am avoiding here. I don't want developers to go crazy 
over their eventually new driver design for their new HW for "no reason".

As I explained above, in this specific case, it means setting a limit to 
trigger the over current interrupt in order to protect the hardware that 
is attached to this regulator.

In other cases, meanings may be *slightly* different (at least, from my 
understanding of it).

Yes I can write it shorter... and even more... but I wanted to improve 
human readability of this function (and this entire driver) because 
regulators may be dangerous, if badly understood and/or badly set.

I just wanted two things:
1. Whoever reviewed my patches couldn't misunderstand what I wrote
    as much as possible;
2. Any other developer reading this driver (which may not be really
    familiar with this HW) gets the meaning of what I'm doing in less
    time, without doing too much time-expensive research.

After all, sometimes, writing shorter code decreases human readability
without improving performance in any way, and I think that this would
be one of these times... so... :))
