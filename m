So if there are already quirks in atom machine drivers to change the 
period size, why is this patch necessary?

I don't recall precisely what this hardware counter does. I vaguely 
recall it's tied to the 19.2MHz external timer which is also used to 
schedule the 1ms SBA mixer and the SSP IOs. And by comparing with the 
ring buffer pointer you can infer the delay inside the DSP. I think you 
are also making an assumption that all streams are tied to the output 
rate, but that's most likely a bad assumption. The hard-coded topology 
supported media, speech and compressed data and the consumption rate on 
the DMA side could be faster with some buffering happening in the DSP. 
It's not a passthrough DMA in all cases.

This is really legacy code that no one really fully understands nor 
plans on improving, it'd be a bad idea to change the pcm pointer reports 
now, 6 years after the initial code release and after all initial 
contributors moved on. It's what it is.

If you force info->pcm_delay to be zero, then runtime->delay is also zero:

see sst_soc_pointer():
	substream->runtime->delay = str_info->pcm_delay;

>>> -	info->pcm_delay = delay_frames;
