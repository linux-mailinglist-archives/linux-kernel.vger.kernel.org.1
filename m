Thanks for checking, nice to know that I'm in good company :)

Right, I don't think volatiles themselves actually constitute barriers;
but I'd better keep quiet, I notice the READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE/data_race
industry has been busy recently, and I'm likely out-of-date and mistaken.

Thanks, and to Mel for his.

Would it be very rude if I leave that to you and to Mel? to add, or
to replace mine if you wish - go ahead.  I can easily see that more
sophistication at the compact_zone_order() end may be preferable to
another test and branch inside __free_one_page() (and would task_capc()
be better with an "unlikely" in it?).

But it seems unnecessary to have a fix at both ends, and I'm rather too
wound up in other things at the moment, to want to read up on the current
state of such barriers, and sign off on the Vlastipatch below myself (but
I do notice that READ_ONCE seems to have more in it today than I remember,
which probably accounts for why you did not put the barrier() I expected
to see on the way out).
