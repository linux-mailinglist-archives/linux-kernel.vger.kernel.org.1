What do you mean by "allocation bitmap blocks and inode table block
fields in the superblock"? Those are in the group descriptor, not the
superblock. Or am I missing something there?

I would be quite interested in that.

I don't. While the data is computed on demand for performance reasons,
the nature and size of all the data is fully known in advance. I never
add data to a filesystem, only create new filesystem images. The kernel
*is* looking at the filesystem in parallel with it being generated,
insofar as blocks aren't constructed until the kernel asks for them
(which is a massive performance win, especially since the kernel may
only want a small subset of the filesystem). But the block contents are
fixed in advance, even if they haven't been generated yet. So the kernel
can read ahead and cache any blocks it wants to, and they'll be valid.
(Excessive readahead might be a performance problem, but not a
correctness one.)

I briefly considered ideas around adding new data after the filesystem
was mounted, and dismissed those ideas just as quickly, for exactly
these reasons (disk caching, filesystem caching, readahead). That would
require a filesystem with at least some subset of cluster features. I
don't plan to go there if I don't have to.

If I do end up needing that, I'd consider proposing an ext4 change along
the lines of making the root directory into a "super-root" directory
under which multiple filesystem roots could live, and supporting a way
to re-read that root to discover new filesystem roots and new block
groups; then, it'd be possible to add a new root whose contents are
*mostly* references to existing inodes (that the kernel would already
have cached), and any modified directories or new/modified files would
have new inodes added. That would isolate the "don't read ahead and
cache" problem to the new inodes, which could potentially be isolated to
new block groups for simplicity, and the "discover new roots" mechanism
could also discover the newly added block groups and inode tables.

But again, I'm not curently looking to do that, and *if* I were, I'd
bring it up for architectural discussion and design on linux-ext4 first.
There's also a balance there between a simple version that'd work for an
append-only read-only filesystem, and a complex version that'd work for
a writable filesystem, and I'd hope more for the former than the latter,
but that'd be a topic for discussion.
