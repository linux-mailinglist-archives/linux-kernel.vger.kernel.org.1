AIUI this is the culprit:

                if (100 * busiest->avg_load <=
                                env->sd->imbalance_pct * local->avg_load)
                        goto out_balanced;

As in your case imbalance_pct=120 becomes the tipping point.

Now, ultimately this would need to scale based on the underlying topology,
right? If you have a system with 2x32 cores running {33 threads, 34
threads}, the tipping point becomes imbalance_pctâ‰ˆ103; but then since you
have this many more cores, it is somewhat questionable.
