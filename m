Should I mention the tool specifically although the tool is WIP? As you
commented previously, should I use tools/arch/x86/tools/cpuid/cpuid as
the future tool and its location?

Or do you want it to be mentioned in the future tense without
specifying the tool name and location?

Sure, let me fix it.

You're right. Let me change it.

Thank you for the comment. I'll add that too.
