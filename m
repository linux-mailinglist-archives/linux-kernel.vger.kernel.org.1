Well, I understand why you need a config option here.
And using the secondary keyring actually makes much more sense to me than
the original approach.

But please do not forget that dm-verity is sometimes used in different
contexts where such strict in-kernel certificate trust is unnecessary.
With your configure options set, you deliberately remove the possibility
to configure such devices.
I understand that it is needed for "trusted" systems, but we should be clear
in the documentation.
Maybe also add note to /Documentation/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.rst ?
We already mention DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG there.

The current userspace configuration through veritysetup does not need
any patches for your patch, correct?

Thanks,
Milan
