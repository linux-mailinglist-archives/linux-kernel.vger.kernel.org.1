Hello Michał,

I tried to investigate whether we could unify the memory timings and
it's hard to tell. The values are mostly off by one in most cases for
one or two registers, in others cases a memory-chip feature is enabled
or disabled for the same memory module. It certainly feels like we could
safely ignore all those minor differences, but I don't have enough
expertise in order to decide firmly. In my opinion it should be better
to leave the memory timings as-is for the starter, we could always get
back to the unification later on.
