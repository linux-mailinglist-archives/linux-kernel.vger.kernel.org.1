Don't worry about that! I'd expect seasoned C programmers to be able
to read Go (or near languages) -- at least to have a general idea of
what an algorithm does.

It is not APL, after all :-)

Well, Kees already mentioned he would like to see it :-) As he said,
it is usually the way for bulk patches to present the
algorithm/semantic patch/etc. that was used.

It is also useful to have it around so that it can be reused/reapplied
later on, too.

It would be nice to have a list of links which cannot be converted,
since nowadays they are likely to be the exception rather than the
rule.

Please take into account that LKML volume is huge and Linus (like
everybody else) only reads a small subset. Further, as a general rule,
Linus shouldn't be picking individual patches to begin with because
that skips the review tree.

Cheers,
Miguel
