The whole idea is completely racey:

          CPU1                            CPU2                  CPU3
 fds[i]->fd = userfaultfd;
 while()
                                       close(userfaultfd)
                                       pthread_join()
                                                            someother_fd = open()
                                                            userfaultfd == someother_fd
     poll(fds)   // <- Still sleeps

The kernel should not be trying to wake poll from fd release, and
userspace should not close a FD that is currently under poll.

Besides, it really does look like poll holds the fget while doing its
work (see poll_freewait), so fops release() won't be called anyhow..
