Can you please drop the below two patches while applying this series?

bus: mhi: Remove auto-start option
net: qrtr: Start MHI channels during init

We realized that without these patches, net-next will be broken for QCA6390.
Proper way to handle this is by using an immutable branch or by carrying the
ath11k change through MHI tree. We decided to handle this in next merge window.

Or if you prefer to have a next revision of the series without these patches
I can send it. Please let me know!

Thanks,
Mani
