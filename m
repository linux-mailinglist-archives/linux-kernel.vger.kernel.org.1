I have reviewed the replicator driver, and compared to all the other CS dri=

This driver appears to be the only one that sets hardware values in
probe() and expects them to remain in place on enable, and uses that
state for programming decisions later, despite telling the PM
infrastructure that it is clear to suspend the device.

Now we have a system where the replicator hardware is behaving
differently under the driver, but is it behaving unreasonably?

I have reviewed the replicator driver, and compared to all the other CS dri=

This driver appears to be the only one that sets hardware values in
probe() and expects them to remain in place on enable, and uses that
state for programming decisions later, despite telling the PM
infrastructure that it is clear to suspend the device.

Now we have a system where the replicator hardware is behaving

I agree, if it can be established that the register values that make
up UCI (pid0-4, devarch, devtype, PID:CLASS=3D=3D0x9), can correctly
identify the parts then a flag can be set in the probe() function and
acted on during the enable() function.

This was a design decision made by the original driver writer. A
normal AMBA device should not lose context due to clock removal (see
drivers/amba/bus.c), so resetting in probe means this operation is
done only once, rather than add overhead in the enable() function,and
later decisions can be made according to the state of the registers
set.

As you have pointed out, for this replicator implementation  the
context is unfortunately not retained when clocks are removed - so an
alternative method is required.

perhaps something like:-

probe()
...
if (match_id_non_persistent_state_regs(ID))
    drvdata->check_filter_val_on_enable;
....

and a re-write of enable:-

enable()
...
CS_UNLOCK()
id0val =3D read(IDFILTER0);
id1val =3D read(IDFILTER1);

/* some replicator designs lose context when AMBA clocks are removed -
check for this */
if (drvdata->check_filter_val_on_enable && (id0val =3D=3D id1val =3D=3D 0x0=
))
   id0val =3D id1val =3D 0xff;

if(id0xal =3D=3D id1val =3D=3D 0xff)
   rc =3D  claim_device()

if (!rc)
   switch (outport)
      case 0: id0val  =3D 0x0; break
      case 1: id1va; =3D 0x0; break;
     default: rc =3D -EINVAL;

if (!rc)
   write(id0val);
   write(id1val);
CS_LOCK()
return rc;
....

Given that the access to the enable() function is predicated on a
reference count per active port, there is also a case for dropping the
check_filter_val_on_enable flag completely - once one port is active,
then the device will remain enabled until both ports are inactive.
This still allows for future development of selective filtering per
port.

One other point here - there is a case as I mentioned above for moving
to a stored value model for the driver - as this is the only coresight
driver that appears to set state in the probe() function rather than
write all on enable.
This however would necessitate a more comprehensive re-write.

Mike
