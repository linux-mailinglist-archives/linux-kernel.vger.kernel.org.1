This looks like nitpicking about terms so let move one

maybe for your use case but we should not consider one to be more

it's not because there are some uncertainties that we should add more

we take into account how fast the se's vruntime will increase during
the next sched period and and compare the end result to decide which
one will run 1st without breaking fair distribution

yes. If a task doesn't need short scheduling latency why it should
preempt current one with lower latency_nice as an example

If the task is really short running, it doesn't use all its running
time and should easily preempt other tasks at wakeup without the need
for an extended vruntime bonus or an extra CPU bandwidth
