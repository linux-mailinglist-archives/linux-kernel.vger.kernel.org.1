Ah, so a different goal (and yes, I finally went over and read the
relevant documentation).  Agreed, the can_sleep path does not really
need to be dipping into the emergency reserves.  And it looks like the
not-from-reclaim restriction is still at least partially in effect,
but one step at a time.

The patch is shown below, which I have queued for a later release.

Thank you, looks like __get_free_pages() is the tool for this job.

Please see below for the aforementioned patch.

commit ea5c19d21233b5e8d3d06c0d4ecd6be9f2829dc3

    kvfree_rcu: Use __GFP_NOMEMALLOC for single-argument kvfree_rcu()
    
    This commit applies the __GFP_NOMEMALLOC gfp flag to memory allocations
    carried out by the single-argument variant of kvfree_rcu(), thus avoiding
    this can-sleep code path from dipping into the emergency reserves.
