Something is wrong here. I woke up my machine from suspend-to-RAM this morning
and saw that a completely idle machine had a loadavg of ~7. According to my
monitoring system this happened to be the loadavg right before I suspended.
I've reverted this, rebooted, created a loadavg >0, suspended and after wake up
loadavg again correctly ranges between 0 and whatever, as expected.
