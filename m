Thanks.  I hit some merge issues when pulling it into a staging branch, but
nothing seemed interesting.  I think the best bet here is to just pull it in
through the RISC-V tree.

Aside from this, I'm ready to send out my first 5.8 PR.  I'm going to put this
on a staging branch and send it up as a second 5.8 merge window PR once
everything else settles.  IIRC our other irqchip changes have been around for a
while, so they should be going up early in the merge window.

LMK if anyone has issues with that.
