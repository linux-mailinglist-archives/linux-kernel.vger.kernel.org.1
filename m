As the commit message says about secure software configuring these LLCC 
registers,
usually 2 things can happen in that case.

1) Accessing those registers in non secure world like Kernel would 
result in a
fault which is trapped by secure side.

2) Access to those registers may be just ignored and there will be no 
faults.

So for older chipsets, this is a fix to not allow them to access those 
registers.
For newer chipsets, we follow the recommended settings from HW/SW arch 
teams.
But... upstream llcc driver only supports SDM845 currently which is not 
required
to configure those registers and as per my testing, no crash is observed 
on SDM845.
So we won't need fixes tag.

Capacity-based allocation and Way-based allocation are cache 
partitioning
schemes/algorithms usually used in shared LLCs. Now which one to use or 
why
one is preferred over the other are decided by HW/SW architecture teams 
and are
recommended by them. So if the question is what is capacity based 
allocation and
how it works, then I am afraid that I will not be able to explain that 
algorithm
just like that.

That's a fair point. I will try to dig through to find some context for 
"question b"
and check if there were any battery vendors involved in this decision ;)

This was my 2nd option, first one was to have this based on the version 
of LLCC
which are exposed by hw info registers. But that didn't turn out good 
since I
couldn't find any relation of this property with LLCC version.

Second option was as you mentioned to have a field to qcom_llcc_config. 
Now this is good,
but then I thought that if we add LLCC support for 20(random number) 
SoCs of which
10 is capable of supporting cap_based_alloc and rest 10 are not, then we 
will still be adding
20 more lines to each SoC's llcc_config if we follow this 2nd option.

So why not opt for a 3rd option with the table where you just need to 
specify only the capable
targets which is just 10 in our sample case above.

Am I just overthinking this too much and should just go with the 2nd 
option as you mentioned?
