Fair warning, one of the other hats I wear is the chief custodian of the
U-Boot project.

Note that on most architectures in modern times the device tree is used
to pass in initrd type information and "initrd=3D" on the command line is
quite legacy.

But what do you mean UEFI "consumes" initrd=3D ?  It's quite expected that
when you configure grub/syslinux/systemd-boot/whatever via extlinux.conf
or similar with "initrd /some/file" something reasonable happens to
read that in to memory and pass along the location to Linux (which can
vary from arch to arch, when not using device tree).  I guess looking at=20
Documentation/x86/boot.rst is where treating initrd=3D as a file that
should be handled and ramdisk_image / ramdisk_size set came from.  I do
wonder what happens in the case of ARM/ARM64 + UEFI without device tree.

That said, no the comment is wrong.  It's not "since 11/2018" but "since
the 1990s".  And it doesn't provide any sort of link / context to the
boot loader specification project or similar that explains the cases
when a non-filename "initrd=3D" would reasonably (or unreasonably but
happens in reality) be removed.

I would go so far as to suggest that adding special handling for some
x86 setups is the wrong to place to start / further deprecate how other
architectures and firmwares handle a given situation.  I'm only chiming
in here as I saw this commit go by on LWN and wanted to see how this was
different from the traditional usage of initrd=3D in the rest of the
kernel (it's not) and then saw the otherwise unrelated new comment being
added.
