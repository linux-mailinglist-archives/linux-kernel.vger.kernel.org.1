This removes the domain switching in iommu_need_mapping(). Another place
where the private domain is used is intel_iommu_add_device(). Joerg's
patch set has remove that. So with domain switching in
iommu_need_mapping() removed, the private domain helpers could be
removed now. Otherwise, the compiler will complain that some functions
are defined but not used.

Yes. If the user chooses to use identity domain by default through
kernel command, identity domain will be applied for all devices. For
those devices with limited addressing capability, bounce buffering will
be used when they try to access the memory beyond their address
capability. This won't cause any kernel regression as far as I can see.

Switching domain during runtime with drivers loaded will cause real
problems as I said in the commit message. That's the reason why I am
proposing to remove it. If we want to keep it, we have to make sure that
switching domain for one device should not impact other devices which
share the same domain with it. Furthermore, it's better to implement it
in the generic layer to keep device driver behavior consistent on all
architectures.

Yes. I will try to use up the allowed characters.
