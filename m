This patch was unfairly cut at the hunk above :)

If you follow the rest of it, you see that the documentation has just
moved 3 lines below:

     /*
    - * Version using sequence counter only.
    - * This can be used when code has its own mutex protecting the
    - * updating starting before the write_seqcountbeqin() and ending
    - * after the write_seqcount_end().
    + * Sequence counters (seqcount_t)
    + *
    + * The raw counting mechanism without any writer protection. Write side
    + * critical sections must be serialized and readers on the same CPU
    + * (e.g. through preemption or interrupts) must be excluded.
    + *
    + * If it's desired to automatically handle the sequence counter writer
    + * serialization and non-preemptibility requirements, use a sequential
    + * lock (seqlock_t) instead.
    + *
    + * See Documentation/locking/seqlock.rst
      */
    +
     typedef struct seqcount {

and:

    +/*
    + * Sequential locks (seqlock_t)
    + *
    + * Sequence counters with an embedded spinlock for writer serialization
    + * and non-preemptibility.
    + *
    + * See Documentation/locking/seqlock.rst
    + */
    +
     typedef struct {
     	struct seqcount seqcount;
     	spinlock_t lock;
     } seqlock_t;

This was done because, as said in the commit log, documentation of
seqcount_t and seqlock_t was originally intermingled. This is incorrect
and confusing since the usage constrains for each type are vastly
different.

Then, the brlock comment:

    This is not as cache friendly as brlock. Also, this may not work
    well for data that contains pointers, because any writer could
    invalidate a pointer that a reader was following.

was removed not because it's moved to Documentation/locking/seqlock.rst,
but because it's obsolete: 0f6ed63b1707 ("no need to keep brlock macros
anymore...").
