And this provides no protection whatsoever to paranoid people AFAICS, unless=
 the location gets hashed before any processing occurs.

But you haven=E2=80=99t answered the most important question: what is the AC=
M doing with this log?  I feel like a lot of details are being covered but t=
he big picture is missing.

I=E2=80=99m having a bit of trouble understanding how this log is useful for=
 a relaunch. At the point that you=E2=80=99re relaunching, the log is even l=
ess trustworthy than on first launch. At least on first launch, if you dial u=
p your secure and verified boot settings tight enough, you can have some deg=
ree of confidence in the boot environment. But on a relaunch, I don=E2=80=99=
t see how the log is useful for anything more than any other piece of kernel=
 memory.

What am I missing?
