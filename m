It would be very difficult to remember complete revision history for
every patch received.  Especially with the lack of a provided
patch-level changelog.  So I have to take each submission on its own
merits.  This is particularly true for patch-sets ranging over 6
months or more.

The Regmap vs raw accesses decision could easily have gone either way,
so it's not surprising the other was considered during the review of
each submission.  Both times were phrased as an "I wonder if" enquiry,
rather than a demand.
