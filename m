After commit 1a8e1cef7 ("arm64: use both ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32")，the 0-4G memory is splited
to DMA [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000003fffffff] and DMA32 [mem 0x0000000040000000-0x00000000ffffffff] on arm64.

From the above discussion, on your platform, the low crashkernel fall in DMA32 region, but your environment needs to access DMA
region, so there is the call trace.

I have a question, why do you choose 0xc0000000 here?

Besides, this is common code, we also need to consider about x86.

Thanks,
Chen Zhou
