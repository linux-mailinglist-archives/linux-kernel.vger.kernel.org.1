I hate the global state part of the freezer.

It's also pointless. We don't want to trigger all the tests that
various random driver kernel threads do.

I also really don't like how now execve() by any random person will
suddenly impact everything that might be doing freezing.

It also makes for a possible _huge_ latency regression for execve(),
since freezing really has never been a very low-latency operation.

Other threads doing IO can now basically block execve() for a long
long long time.

Finally, I think your patch is fundamentally broken for another
reason: it depends on CONFIG_FREEZER, and that isn't even required to
be set!

So no, this is not at all acceptable in that form.

Now, maybe we could _make_ it acceptable, by

 (a) add a per-process freezer count to avoid the global state for this case

 (b)  make a small subset of the freezing code available for the
!CONFIG_FREEZER thing

 (c) fix this "simple freezer" to not actually force wakeups etc, but
catch things in the

but honestly, at that point nothing of the "CONFIG_FREEZER" code even
really exists any more. It would be more of a "execve_synchronize()"
thing, where we'd catch things in the scheduler and/or system call
entry/exit or whatever.

Also, that makes these kinds of nasty hacks that just make the
existign freezer code even harder to figure out:

Ugh. Just _ugly_.

And honestly, completely and utterly broken. See above.

I understand the wish to re-use existing infrastructure. But the fact
is, the FREEZER code is just about the _last_ thing you should want to
use. That, and stop_machine(), is just too much of a big hammer.
