No, the reason for exposing a backlight is that while the thing
certainly is a PWM signal, the description of it and the registers
available to control it surely seems "backlight" to me.

In particular No, the reason for exposing a backlight is that while
while the thing certainly is a PWM signal, the description of it and the
registers available to control it surely seems "backlight" to me.

The main problem I saw with exposing this as a PWM was the fact that we
have both period and frequency to control...

...and in the even that you use it as a "generic" PWM I'd expect that
the specified period is related to the frequency of the signal. But the
period is documented to be related to the number of brightness steps of
the panel.

That would work, I had it as "max-brightness" for a while as well. But I
reverted to backlight-scale, because that's the name used in the
datasheet.

I'm fine with whatever color of the shed though :)

I guess there's no problem in having a "num-steps" that is unrelated to
the number of brightness steps of the panel - but I did distinguish them
because the datasheet clearly does so.

Yes, that should be covered.

Please help me figure out how to properly expose this in the PWM api and
I'll be happy to respin it using this - as you say my wheel does look
pretty similar...
