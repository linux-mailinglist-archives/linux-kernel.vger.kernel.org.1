I think it does, since the refcount is no longer 1:1 with the number
of tasks that have it (a notification fd's struct file has a reference
too).

We could also do it the reverse way, and keep track of how many
notification fds point to a particular file. But somehow we need two
counts.

Maybe it's best to decouple them entirely, and have usage go back to
just being the number of tasks, and introduce a new counter for
notification fds.

That seems nicest, agreed.
