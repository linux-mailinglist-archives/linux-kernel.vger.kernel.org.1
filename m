i_nlink == 1 just means that there is one non-deleted link.  There can be links
that have since been deleted, and file descriptors can still be open to them.

The non-deleted link is the one counted in i_nlink.

Because we need to get the dentry that hasn't been deleted yet, which isn't
necessarily the one associated with the file descriptor being fsync()'ed.

The problem is that i_pino gets set incorrectly.  I just noticed this while
reviewing the code.  It's not hard to reproduce, e.g.:

#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main()
{
        int fd;

        mkdir("dir1", 0700);
        mkdir("dir2", 0700);
        mknod("dir1/file", S_IFREG|0600, 0);
        link("dir1/file", "dir2/file");
        fd = open("dir2/file", O_WRONLY);
        unlink("dir2/file");
        write(fd, "X", 1);
        fsync(fd);
}

Then:

sync
echo N | dump.f2fs -i $(stat -c %i dir1/file) /dev/vdb | grep 'i_pino'
echo "dir1 (correct): $(stat -c %i dir1)"
echo "dir2 (wrong): $(stat -c %i dir2)"

i_pino will point to dir2 rather than dir1 as expected.
