What Bard is saying is that there is nothing board-specific here. This 
is platform-driver code that is independent of the actual machine 
configuration.

Machine drivers can be board-specific, so we would have to add the code 
for prepare/deprepare/trigger to every machine driver.

Today it's true that we worked to have a single machine driver for all 
SoundWire-based devices, so the change is a 1:1 move, but we can't 
guarantee that this would be the case moving forward. In fact, we *know* 
we will need a different machine driver when we parse platform firmware 
to create the card for SDCA support. So in the end there would be 
duplication of code.

See the code we worked on at 
https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/commit/7322e1d25ce2ec9bb78c6e861919f61e0be7cc0b.patch

it'd really a bit silly to have this generic code in the machine driver.

it would be fine to call a set of helpers called from the machine driver 
dailink, but where would we put these helpers? on the ASoC or SoundWire 
sides?
