1. You can, just the startup time will be a little slower? E.g., grow
pre-allocated 4G file to 8G.

2. Or let's be creative: teach QEMU to construct a single
RAMBlock/MemoryRegion out of multiple tmpfs files. Works as long as you
don't go crazy on different VM sizes / size differences.

3. In your example above, you can dynamically rebalance as VMs are
getting sold, to make sure you always have "big ones" lying around you
can shrink on demand.

As I expressed a couple of times already, I don't see why using
hugetlbfs and implementing some sort of pre-zeroing there isn't sufficient.

We really don't *want* complicated things deep down in the mm core if
there are reasonable alternatives.
