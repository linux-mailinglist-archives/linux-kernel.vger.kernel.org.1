Subject: [PATCH v3 3/4] regulator: core: Add basic enable/disable support for
 sync_state() callbacks

Consider the following example:
- regulator-X is provided by device-X.
- regulator-X is a supplier to device-A, device-B and device-C.
- device-A is off/inactive from boot.
- device-B and device-C are left on/active by the bootloader
- regulator-X is left on boot by the bootloader at 2000 mV to supply
  device-B and device-C.

Example boot sequence:
1. device-X is probed successfully.
2. device-A is probed by driver-A
   a. driver-A gets regulator-X
   b. driver-A votes on regulator-X
   c. driver-A initializes device-A
   d. driver-A votes off regulator-X
   e. regulator-X is turned off.
3. System crashes or device-B and device-C become unreliable because
   regulator-X was turned off without following the proper quiescing
   steps for device-B and device-C.

There are Android devices that exhibit the issue in the example where
regulator-X is an LDO, device-A is a camera device and device-B and
device-C are UFS and USB. To avoid this, they have their own downstream
changes to the regulator framework.

This patch addresses the problem in the example by:

1. When a regulator is registered,
   a. The sync_state() callback for the regulator's device is set to
      regulator_sync_state(). The sync_state() callback is called when
      all the consumers of the regulator's device have probed
      successfully.
   b. If the regulator is ON at boot, a BOOT-LIMITS consumer is created
      for the regulator and an enable vote is made.

2. When the regulator_sync_state() callback comes, all the boot-on
   regulators registered by that device will have the BOOT-LIMITS enable
   vote removed and the BOOT-LIMITS consumer freed.

If an exclusive get is ever attempted on a boot-on regulator with an
active BOOT-LIMITS vote, the regulator is handed off to the new consumer
(and the BOOT-LIMITS freed) without affecting the regulator state. This
ensures, consumers doing exclusive gets continue to work after this
commit.

To maintain backward compatibility with systems where some consumers of
the device might never probe, a new regulator_cleanup_timeout kernel
commandline argument is added and defaulted to 30 seconds. When the
timeout is a non-zero value and it expires, all BOOT-LIMITS consumer
votes are removed even if the sync_state() callbacks haven't been
called.

In systems where all the consumers are expected to probe, the
regulator_cleanup_timeout can be set to 0. When that's done, the
BOOT-LIMITS consumer votes for a regulator are removed only when all the
consumers of the regulator's device have probed.

So with this patch and regulator_cleanup_timeout=0, the example will work
as follows:

1. device-X is probed successfully.
   a. regulator-X is registered.
   b. Since regulator-X is on, an enable vote is made by the BOOT-LIMITS
      consumer.
2. device-A is probed by driver-A
   a. driver-A gets regulator-X
   b. driver-A votes on regulator-X
   c. driver-A initializes device-A
   d. driver-A votes off regulator-X
   e. regulator-X is NOT turned off due to BOOT-LIMITS consumer.
3. device-B is probed by driver-B
   a. driver-B gets regulator-X
   b. driver-B votes on regulator-X
   c. driver-B initializes device-B.
   d. driver-B votes off regulator-X because device-B enters runtime
      idle.
   e. regulator-X is NOT turned off due to BOOT-LIMITS consumer.
4. device-C is probed by driver-C
   a. Does stuff similar to device-B and votes off regulator-X.
5. Since all consumers of device-X have probed, device-X gets
   sync_state() callback which is a call to regulator_sync_state():
   a. BOOT-LIMITS removes enable vote for regulator-X
   b. regulator-X is turned off.
   c. BOOT-LIMITS consumer is freed.
6. The system is stable because regulator-X is only turned off after
   device-B and device-C get to initialize and quiesce properly.

OR

Same steps for 1 - 3 as above.
4. device-C is never probed because driver-C isn't available.
5. Since all consumers of device-X have NOT probed, device-X doesn't get
   sync_state() callback.
   a. BOOT-LIMITS votes continue to be enforced for regulator-X
6. device-C continues to work in the mode the boot loader left it in and
   the system remains usable. For example, device C is
   - A display backlight that doesn't have a driver
   - An interconnect that doesn't have an interconnect provider driver
