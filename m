To me that makes sense. I think such strategy does fit to what we do,
i mean we need to release memory asap. Doing it without initiating of
long process of memory reclaim and do it only lightly(what __GFP_NORETRY does)
is a good approach. We have an option to fallback to synchronize_rcu().

But that is for sleepable context.

I have a question about non-sleeping context as well and how we allocate one
page:

<snip>
   bnode = (struct kvfree_rcu_bulk_data *)
       __get_free_page(GFP_NOWAIT | __GFP_NOWARN);

<snip>

Johannes, i saw you mentioned earlier that waking up a kswapd is not a
good idea, what actually GFP_NOWAIT does. Do you recommend to exclude
it? Also to replace by what? __GFP_HIGH|__GFP_ATOMIC?

Thank you in advance!
