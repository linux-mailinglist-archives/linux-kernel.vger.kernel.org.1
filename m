Mike was ok with suggested-by, so I will go with that.

Sure will add in next version.

Yes I understand it is quite ugly, but AFAIK we do not have any SoCs 
already released
and coming in near future with such limitations in funnels or other 
components. So I will
stick to the replicator specific property.

Thanks for reviewing these patches.
