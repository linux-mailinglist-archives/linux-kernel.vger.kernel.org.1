The patch has a Fixes tag and so it is not unrealistic to assume that it
will hit older trees. I wasn't really implying stable tree backport and
I do not think this is a stable material.

All I was arguing here is that a fix/workaround which doesn't add new
side effects is a safer option.

Yes I do agree here.

No disagreement here either. But please remember that the example I've
given is a clear violation of the protection. Let me paste it here so
that we have both examples in one email:
: Let's have global and A's reclaim in parallel:
:  |
:  A (low=2G, usage = 3G, max = 3G, children_low_usage = 1.5G)
:  |\
:  | C (low = 1G, usage = 2.5G)
:  B (low = 1G, usage = 0.5G)
: 
: for A reclaim we have
: B.elow = B.low
: C.elow = C.low
: 
: For the global reclaim
: A.elow = A.low
: B.elow = min(B.usage, B.low) because children_low_usage <= A.elow
: C.elow = min(C.usage, C.low)
: 
: With the effective values reseting we have A reclaim
: A.elow = 0
: B.elow = B.low
: C.elow = C.low
: 
: and global reclaim could see the above and then
: B.elow = C.elow = 0 because children_low_usage > A.elow

I hope we both agree that B shouldn't be reclaimed whether the reclaim
comes from A or above A. The race is not possible with with the patch
working around the problem in mem_cgroup_protection().

You are right that hooking into mem_cgroup_protection wouldn't prevent
the race in this example. But in this example the race really doesn't
matter because the overall protection is not violated. A1 would get
reclaimed by A anyway. But in my example there is a protected memcg
which shouldn't get reclaimed.
