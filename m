You are right. I am not familiar with the code and only looked at 1b.

Just preprocessed head_64.S and verified many target symbols are in
.data and .pgtable  The assembler converts an expression `foo - symbol_defined_in_same_section`
to be `foo - . + offset` which can be encoded as an R_X86_64_PC32 (or
resolved the fixup if it is a constant, e.g. `1b - startup_32`)

With your approach, the important property is that "the distance between
startup_32 and the target symbol is a constant", not that "startup_32
has link address 0".  `ra`, `rva`, `rvma` or any other term which expresses "relative"
should work.  Hope someone can come up with a good suggestion:)
