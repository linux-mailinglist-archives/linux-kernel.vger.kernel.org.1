Well the only values I see that change that regmap should care about are 
in first page of the register map.

After reverse engineering a binary I found that its contents modify page 
0 registers of the device.

Not a fan of this as it causes un-wanted changes that may have been setup.

Yes I agree

Well the reason to set this back to page 0 is that is where the book 
register is.

So setting this back to page 0 set the Book register appropriately.

Yeah. After reading this and thinking about this for a couple days.  
This actually has contention issues with the ALSA controls.

There needs to also be some locks put into place.

I prefer to disable the cache.  Not sure how many other devices use 
Books and pages for register maps besides TI.

Adding that to regmap might be to specific to our devices.

No you are right.  The issue with using enums is that the binary is not 
parsed until after codec_probe and the device is registered.

So the controls would appear later which could be a race condition for 
the user space.

I will have to look into doing this.  I blindly copy this data because 
there is really not a viable and reliable way to check sizes against the 
structures.

This I can check once the data is copied.
