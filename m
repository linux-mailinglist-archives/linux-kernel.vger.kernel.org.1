Hi!

(Sorry for the delay, I missed your response.)

Thanks for the follow up. This sounds like a good enough motivation
for this patch, but please include it in the changelog.

I don't know what people use these days. When I did benchmarking in
the past, hackbench and netperf were known to be slab-allocation
intensive macro-benchmarks. Christoph also had some SLUB
micro-benchmarks, but I don't think we ever merged them into the tree.
