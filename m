ok, I see. I am just starting now to familiarize myself how you were
able to align all these concepts between MPAM and RDT using the
mpam_device and mpam_component.

ok. Not all the partitioning types are quite clear to me
(proportional-stride partitioning specifically), but I can see that
there are similarities. (I am assuming you meant MBA)

I am not sure about "perfectly".

If I understand correctly at least there is the caveat that MPAM is like
RDT with CDP always enabled without reducing number of CLOSIDs?

But ...

The assumption of resctrl fs is that a task would belong to a single
resource group, which in turn represents a single CLOSID/PARTID(?). On
the other hand MPAM allows a task to have different PARTIDs for code and
data. It seems that perhaps MPAM will be supported in Linux by having
its PARTIDs behave as RDT with CDP enabled (the odd/even pairing) and
thus perhaps not as flexible as the architecture supports/intends?
(Although I see you later mention that the goal is _not_ for MPAM to
emulate CDP so it is not clear to me how this would be supported).

Would user looking at schemata on resctrl on Arm thus always see the
CODE/DATA prefix on the cache resources? I am trying to create a high
level idea of what a user's interaction with resctrl fs would look like
on an Arm system and how that would be translated on a high level to
what it means for the hardware (allocating new PARTIDs, setting of
PARTIDs, etc.). (small steps)

Currently up to three monitors per RMID if considering a monitor to be
the same as a counter?

If I understand correctly the PARTID and PMG are global because that is
the MPAM information that accompanies all memory requests as it
traverses through the system.

In comparison the resource monitors seem to be entirely contained in the
MSC to which they belong ... and an MSC is allowed to have up to 2^16 of
each type.

It seems that it may at least theoretically be possible to have many
more counters than PARTID, or PARTID+PMG.

I see your point about them being more similar to PMU.

I've been trying to different ideas also but cannot find a good fit in
resctrl either.

(I seem to have trouble mapping both the partioning and monitoring MPAM
features to resctrl ... apologies as it is taking me some time to catch
up with where you are at this time)

I cannot find mention of this specifically in the new spec. Do you
perhaps have other documentation about this?

Apologies, the issue is not clear to me. I am familiar with the slicing
of L3, Intel systems do that also. Your concern that preceded this was
that the monitor code implicitly assumes "this" CPU. Could you please
elaborate more on this? The RMIDs have global scope within the package
(L3 cache domain instance) and keeps track of all CPUs associated with
it (rdt_domain->cpu_mask). The user queries each domain separately and
the counter value is read from any CPU associated with the particular
domain. How I see it the monitor code thus tracks which CPUs are
associated with a particular cache instance and would interact with an
appropriate CPU depending on which data/counter the user is requesting.

Are you saying that resctrl fs would provide an interface to the
"resctrl_pmu" addition to perf?

I did see the introduction of the new schema list that points to the
resources that appears to separate the user interface and the
architecture differences very well.

... oh ... no to emulate CDP. (I need to understand how the two PARTIDs
of a task are configured ... I will keep digging through the spec and
the patches).

Thank you very much for this insight into what is being considered.

Agreeing on "no user-visible changes" really helps to guide this initial
work. The split between core and arch may be more flexible and may be
done on an as-needed basis?
