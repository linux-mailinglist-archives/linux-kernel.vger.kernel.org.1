The event->sink link is established at creation. At event::add(), we
check the sink is free (i.e, it is inactive) or is used by an event
of the same session (this is where the owner field *was* required. But
this is not needed anymore, as we cache the "owner" read pid in the 
handle->rb->aux_priv for each event and this is compared against the
pid from the handle currently driving the hardware)

Correct, we don't need it after the event creation "one part of the 
patch" as explained above.

Thats where we are diverging. The sink device doesn't have any fops. It
is all managed by the coresight driver transparent to the perf tool. All
the perf tool does is, specifying which sink to use (btw, we now have
automatic sink selection support which gets rid of this, and uses
the best possible sink e.g, in case of per-CPU sinks).

Sink is already mapped at event create. But yes, the refcount on the
sink is managed at start/stop. Thats when we need to make sure that the
event being scheduled belongs to the same owner as the one already
driving the sink.

That way another session could use the same sink if it is free. i.e

perf record -e cs_etm/@sink0/u --per-thread app1

and

perf record -e cs_etm/@sink0/u --per-thread app2

both can work as long as the sink is not used by the other session.
