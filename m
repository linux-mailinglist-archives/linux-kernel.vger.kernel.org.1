Hmm, I think these are reasonable options when you have control over the 
system, but not so great if you don't. For example, I want to get pressure 
notifications for my logind seat, but that doesn't necessarily imply that I 
have administrative access to the machine.

There's precedent for other similar issues like this in the kernel, eg. rates 
for some ICMP packets, where we enforce a static limit in the kernel for 
unprivileged users. I'd imagine we can do something similar here, too.

Well, fiddlesticks :-)

If we needed to have both, I don't know what the interface would look like, but 
yes, it sounds overcomplicated. I'll think about it some more.

Thanks,

Chris
