We have HSF RT(High-speed Service Framework Response-Time) monitors, the
RT figures fluctuated randomly, then we deployed a tool detecting "irq
off" and "preempt off" to dump the culprit's calltrace, capturing the
list_lock cost up to 100ms with irq off issued by "ss", this also caused
network timeouts.

I thought that before, but most atomic operations are serialized by the
list_lock. Another possible way is to hold list_lock in __slab_free(),
then these two counters can be changed from atomic to long.

I also have no idea what's the standard SLUB benchmark for the
regression test, any specific suggestion?

Sounds good.

Thanks!
