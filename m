I don't see this being available to non-root users.

One possibility is to simply treat NOHZ_FULL cpus as offline from the
perspective of sched_pair_cpu: no kworker thread on those, and the
queuing is handled elsewhere. As long as rseq is not be used on NOHZ_FULL
cpus concurrently with sched_pair_cpu targeting those CPUs, it would work.

The main issue is that cpuset partitions are changed dynamically at runtime
by external "manager" processes (e.g. Android). To make things even more
interesting, cpusets support both "process" and "threaded" domain types.

There are quite a few scenarios which worry me with this approach, e.g.:

A) rseq and sched_pair_cpu are used by a memory allocator within a process,
   and specific threads of that process eventually have their cpuset changed
   to exclude some cpus (with cpusets applied per-thread rather than per-process).
   Now the memory allocator needs to touch the per-cpu data of specific cpus to
   which it does not have access from a given thread while other threads within
   the process still use it concurrently.

B) A tracer ring buffer works on per-cpu data in shared memory across processes
   with rseq and sched_pair_cpu, and races on per-cpu data because an external
   manager process concurrently applies different cpusets (with process domain)
   to processes interacting over that shared memory.

Indeed, for the offline case, the kworker really does not need to keep burning
CPU time. I should eventually have it sleep for a while instead, or have the work
queues for all offline cpus handled by a single kworker for the entire system.

So treating NOHZ_FULL cpus as offline, I'm all good with that. Treating cpus which
are not in the cpuset as offline, not so much.

Thanks,

Mathieu
