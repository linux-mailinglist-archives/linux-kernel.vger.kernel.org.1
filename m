Hmm, I will think more about it. Somehow I feel if we want to monitor
at the page sized region granularity then this will be really helpful.

BTW I am still going over the series and my humble request would be to
wait till I have gone through the series completely and provided the
feedback then you can send the next version after incorporating the
feedback.
