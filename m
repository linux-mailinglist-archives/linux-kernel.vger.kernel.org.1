Ah, now I see. strsep() has a special case that is not covered
by my patch.

On the other hand, get_line() is only called as get_line(&pos) and
pos = buf can not be NULL because that is checked before in read_dump().
This is why I did not observe a segfault.

But it is wise to make get_line() it more robust than needed. We do
never know who will copy this code fragment... And I am tempted to
handle the get_line(NULL) case as well.

Yes, I will do in the next days.
