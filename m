You are talking about direct reclaim but this path is shared with the
background reclaim. This is a bit confusing. Maybe you just want to
outline the latency in the reclaim which is more noticeable in the
direct reclaim to the userspace. This would be good to be clarified.

How much memory are we talking about here btw?

Is the later implemented?

Btw. overall intention of the patch is not really clear to me. Do I get
it right that this is going to reduce latency of the reclaim for pages
that are not reclaimable anyway because they are pinned? If yes do we
have any numbers for that.

It would be also good to explain why the bail out is implemented in
try_to_unmap rather than shrink_shrink_page_list.

I do not understand why the page table walk needs to be done. The page
is going to be pinned no matter how many page tables are mapping it
right?
