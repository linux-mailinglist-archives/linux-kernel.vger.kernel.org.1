I think this was my fault. The samples with call-graphs are large and I forgot
to increase the mapped ringbuffer with the -m option.
So the buffer default size is 128 pages (516kb) which fills quite quickly.

Sorry for the noise.

I also realized this status line running perf top

Too slow to read ring buffer (change period (-c/-F) or limit CPUs (-C)

It shows up after ca 1 minutes on an idle system.
I guess this is the sane root cause?
