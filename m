At a very high level this looks far too complicated.  Some of that is
due to the protocol it's implementing which looks awfully like you've
got a microcontroller in there trying to proxy a bus of some kind but
there looks to be a lot of abstraction layers simply within the software
here which make things hard to follow.  At the very least there doesn't
seem to be any interaction with this other than proxying stuff.  As
things stand this would be the largest regmap bus implementation by an
order of magnitude.

It is not clear to me that this is really a generic thing that will have
multiple users and that it shouldn't be implemented as reg_read() and
reg_write() operations in the driver that uses it.

This comment is not particularly intelligable.  I assume all these
number/letter combinations are references to something - it'd be good to
say what.

These and many of the other constants are liable to conflict with
something, namespacing would be good.

Do these need to be packed?

This could be more simply written using max() couldn't it (which IIRC
can also be evaluated at compile time)?

Please write this using normal conditional statements for legibility.

No need to cast away from char *.

Please write the is_read check as an if/else, it'd be clearer.

I'm not seeing any bounds checking on the size of an operation in this
function and I think I'd expect some, similarly for a lot of the other
I/O operations.

Please rewrite this loop so it's clear that it terminates, usually
that'd mean a do { } while (!timeout) type construction.  The extra
effort involved in doing one more check after timeout could just as well
be a slightly longer timeout and it'd be clearer.

If the system is that heavily loaded I fear there's bigger problems, you
could also express the timeout in terms of number of times you poll with
a delay (at the minute this will busy wait which doesn't seem ideal
either).

This is the sort of thing I'm looking at when I say this code has too
many abstraction layers, this function and all of the functions it calls
have exactly one caller spread out all over the code and I can't help
but think that some of them could be usefully inlined.  As things stand
it's really hard to tell what any individual bit of code is supposed to
be doing or if it's doing it correctly.

Please write normal conditional statements for legibility.

Please write these as proper functions so that the compiler can check
things more thoroughly.

The cast on the length looks worrying... =20

Most controllers support configurable bits per word (and modes) - you
shouldn't be rejecting things based on whatever the default happens to
be.

This seems confused, you shouldn't have both unformatted I/O operations
and register I/O operations.  Either the hardware implements a byte
stream and the core will handle formatting register operations into that
byte stream or the hardware understands registers and values in which
case there shouldn't be unformatted operations.  A combination of the
two is not going to work well.
