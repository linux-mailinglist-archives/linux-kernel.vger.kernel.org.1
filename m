No, it is created per device name. For example Loopback has its own char 
device file node. if we add another channel for a new mhi device new 
device file node would be created.

Will fix poll.My idea was indeed to mention generic file operations so 
that we dont have to be specific with use case. Any userspace entity who 
wants to communicate over mhi can use the driver. Reason we have this 
driver is to abstract the mhi core specific details. Even for loopback 
use case, userspace can echo to device file node on one channel and get 
a same in response from another channel back. I can add more examples of
other user space drivers use case if that helps.

Done.

yes. i can say "MHI client in userspace"?
