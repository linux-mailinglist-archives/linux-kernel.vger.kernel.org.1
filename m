Yes, please see below.

To be honest, I don't understand it... OK, suppose that the main thread
M execs and zap_other_threads() finds a single (and alive) sub-thread T,
sig->notify_count = 1.

If T is traced, then ->notify_count won't be decremented until the tracer
reaps this task, so we have the same problem.

This is fixeable, say, we can uglify exit_notify() like my patch does,
but:

Well, I am not sure. Just for example, seccomp(SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC)
can fail after mt-exec because seccomp_can_sync_threads() finds a zombe
thread. Sure, this too can can be fixed, but I think there should be no
other threads after exec.

And:

We can share sighand_struct with TASK_ZOMBIE's. The problem is that
we can not unshare ->sighand until they go away, execing thread and
zombies must use the same sighand->siglock to serialize the access to
->thread_head/etc.

OK, we probably can if we complicate unshare_sighand(), we will need
to take tasklist_lock/oldsighand->siglock unconditionally to check
oldsighand->count > sig->nr_thread, then do

	for_each_thread(current, t) {
		t->sighand = newsighand;
		__cleanup_sighand(oldsighand);
	}

but see above, I don't think this makes any sense.

Oleg
