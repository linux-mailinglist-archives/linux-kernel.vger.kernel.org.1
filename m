It does. Now you need to write it up in a detailed form so that it is
clear to readers months/years from now what exactly can happen. You can
use a two-column format like

	CPU A				CPU B

Bla
					Blu

This happens now here
					But this needs to happen there

and so on.

Also, from reading up a bit on this, Documentation/RCU/checklist.rst says

"Use of the expedited primitives should be restricted to rare
configuration-change operations that would not normally be undertaken
while a real-time workload is running."

so why are you using synchronize_srcu_expedited()? Grepping the tree
reveals only a couple of call sites only... but I've almost no clue of
RCU so lemme CC Paul.

Thx.
