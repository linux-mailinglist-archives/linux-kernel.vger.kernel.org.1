Looking at leds-class.rst we don't have a useful devicename so
should that just be omitted and s.th. like

		label = "blue:status";
		label = "green:status";
		label = "red:status";

be used instead. If we want to map to current usage

		label = "blue:status";
		label = "green:boot";
		label = "red:charging";

would be even closer but since that is bound to change just going with
"status" would make sense.
