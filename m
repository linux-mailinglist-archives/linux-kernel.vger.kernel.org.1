Sure, I get the concept.  ...but:

* It seems like it would be ideal to not call __tcs_set_trigger() from
the IRQ handler.  It uses write_tcs_reg_sync() which has a wait loop
in it.  That's not something you normally want in an IRQ handler.

* It seems like it would be a common case for the WAKE_TCS to be
borrowed several times in-between actually using it as a WAKE_TCS.

To make both of the above things better, it seems like you could just
leave the WAKE_TCS configured for active-mode transfers and just
switch all that stuff off when you actually need it as a WAKE_TCS.  To
some extent we could conceptually re-envision this and think of this
as being the ACTIVE_TCS that is occasionally borrowed to make up for
not having a WAKE_TCS.


In any case, I think the patch you have right now is good enough and
it feels like it's overdue to land this series.  I'd suggest against
spinning at this point.  Maybe we can try to improve this in a future
patch after your series lands.
