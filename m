Both of these quirks are different.

PADCALIB is for auto calibration support.

NEEDS_PAD_CONTROL is for SoC having separate 3V3 and 1V8 pads where they=20
have pad state selection and also diff drive strengths apply based on=20
3V3 and 1V8 which are used only when auto cal is not used/failed.

So, above warnings are applicable only for SoC having separate pad=20
controls. Other SoC which don't have separate pads use default drive=20
strengths.
