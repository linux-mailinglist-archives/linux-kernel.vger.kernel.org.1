I lost at the downstream driver vs the individual patch here. So the
downstream driver is also an individual patch right or did I get
something completely wrong.

So if someone prepares a patch and includes a commit description
saying it is taken from downstream, does it mean he is the author
of that patch? Shouldn't the author be included in  "From: Author"
and his signed-off appear first before the submitter's(also a 
contributor)
signed-off? Or is it because these clock data is auto generated and it
doesnt really matter?

Yes makes sense to not have co-developed-by for forwarding patch.

Thanks,
