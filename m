I see a bug. In the print, local and device EE are switched. So device 
is
actually in EDL EE when this interrupt occurs and with device in 
SYS_ERR, we
should call status_cb with MHI_CB_FATAL_ERROR, but we don't.

In drivers/bus/mhi/core/internal.h:
#define MHI_IN_PBL(ee) (ee == MHI_EE_PBL || ee == MHI_EE_PTHRU || \
			ee == MHI_EE_EDL)

We have some changes coming here, but for now you may want to add a 
patch to
fix it. The check should be if (MHI_IN_PBL(mhi_cntrl->ee)), so your 
controller
gets the callback.

If EE was AMSS and a SYS_ERROR was received, we expect to proceed with 
the
handling of mhi_pm_sys_err_handler(mhi_cntrl) which is what you do now 
and it
does the required clean-up. But with Hemant and my proposal, we don't 
need
additional hacks/if checks and extra code over there after SYS_ERR 
processing
is done, so we can avoid that and have clean code/approach.

In RDDM, we wait for device to send us the RDDM image and then do an MHI 
power
cycle. In EDL, however, host needs to send the image and since we know 
EE went
from AMSS->EDL, we push EDL image in an existing way after MHI clean up.
