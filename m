Sorry, I think I should have provided more context about that.

The only reason to use namespaces is to force the traffic of these
netperf tests to go through the external bridge. To test netperf
different possibilities than the testpmd (or pktgen or others "blast
of frames unconditionally" tests).

This way, I make sure that is the same version of everything in the
guest, and is a little bit easier to manage cpu affinity, start and
stop testing...

I could use a different VM for sending and receiving, but I find this
way a faster one and it should not introduce a lot of noise. I can
test with two VM if you think that this use of network namespace
introduces too much noise.
