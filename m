What Paul, Adian and others are trying to achieve here is consistency.
See also the debate on openwrt-devel:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2020-April/022567.html

The goal is to make it easier for users and semi-automated processes
to identify the right OpenWrt image for a specific device.
This especially becomes necessary for OTA updates and we have invested
quite a bit of work to no longer need to scrape and translate that
with additional layers of abstraction but simply use the first (ie.
most significant) compatible from DTS to indentify the right image.

As product-name aliases are indeed very common, we usually deal with it
in a way that the first product name which hits the OpenWrt tree is
used for model, compatible, DTS- and image filenames. We then add
aliases to that in our build-scripts which allows web-based wizards and
such to match the alternative names as well when entered by the user.
