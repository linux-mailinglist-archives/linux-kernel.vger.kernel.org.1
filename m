I think it'd make sense to add this constraint, either in the machine 
driver or in the platform driver, so that we don't change the position 
updates and introduce more issues by accident by doing so. As you 
rightly said, I don't think anyone tested periods multiple of 256 
samples so it's not a regression, more aligning with the internal design.
