I think the first approach is more common.

It's better to avoid that.

I'm not sure if memblock_free() works after early memory initialization
is complete, but I think there is some way to do it later. Maybe try
memblock_free() first, and then look for something else if it doesn't
work.

I think you should try to fix the driver rather than making an
exception for it. Hot-pluggable drivers are a much more interesting
case I think, because on the one hand you have no idea what
users might want to plug in legitimately, but on the other hand
those are also the most likely attack vectors (driver bugs for
random USB drivers overwriting kernel memory when faced with
malicious hardware) that this feature is trying to prevent.

I also wonder whether we should do something in the normal
iommu code that prevents one from mapping a page that the
kernel would consider as protected (kernel .text, freed memory,
...) into the iommu in the first place.
