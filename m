So the last posting made hackernews; and there a bunch expressed far
more interest in coroutines, which, if I'm not mistaken, can also be
implemented using all this.

Would that not make for a far simpler and more convincing use-case?

I really think we want to have block/resume detection sorted before this
goes anywhere, I also strongly feel BPF should not be used for
functional interfaces like that.

That is, I want to see a complete interface before I want to commit to
an ABI that we're stuck with.

I also want to see userspace that goes along with it; like with
sys_membarrier() / liburcu and sys_rseq() / librseq (which seems to be
heading for glibc).

Also, and this seems to be the crux of the whole endeavour, you want to
allow your 'fibers' to block. Which is what makes
{make,swap,get,set}context() unsuited for your needs and gives rise to
the whole block/resume issue above.

Also, I want words on the interaction between resume notification and
wake-up preemption. That is, how do you envision managing the
interaction between the two schedulers.


All in all, I don't think you're even close to having something
mergable.
