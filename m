I think it is the case. And even if not, it would only cause a pointless 
call to elf_update() in the end and that should not do any harm anyway if 
I am not mistaken.

However, I think there is a problem with the rebase on top of the current 
code. The patch moves elf_write() call to orc_gen.c which was ok before 
Peterz introduced elf_write_insn() et al. We need to keep elf_write() in 
check.c for this case too.
