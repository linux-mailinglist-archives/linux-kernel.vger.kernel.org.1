Let's propose tagging that PLIC spec as v1.0.0 in the platform spec group, but
I don't see a reason why that wouldn't be viable.  Assuming that's all OK, we
can start calling this a RISC-V PLIC (in addition to a SiFive PLIC, as they'll
be compatible).

The CLINT is a SiFive spec.  It has open source RTL so it's been implemented in
other designs, but it's not a RISC-V spec.  The CLIC, which is a superset of
the CLINT, is a RISC-V spec.  IIRC it's not finished yet (it's the fast
interrupts task group), but presumably we should have a "riscv,clic-2.0.0" (or
whatever it ends up being called) compat string to go along with the
specification.
