The timer is not the issue.  usb_kill_anchored_urbs() waits until all 
the URBs have completed, and those completions happen when the timer 
fires.

The only suspicious thing I see is that usblp_resume() calls 
handle_bidir() without first acquiring any mutex.  But resume shouldn't 
race with disconnect.

The only other place where read URBs get submitted is under
usblp_read(), which does acquire the mutex and checks for disconnection
while holding it.

So I'm baffled.
