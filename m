I certainly disagree with you on this. I think it's useful to discern
the object itself from data associated with it. Let's consider struct
irq_data and let's imagine it would be called struct irq instead. The
latter would be misleading - as this struct contains a lot additional
fields that form the context for the irq but aren't logically part of
the "irq object". And then you have irq_common_data which is even more
disconnected from the irq. This also would make using the name "irq"
for the variables containing the global irq number confusing.

I think the same happens here: we may want to use the name "line" for
local variables and then having "struct line_data" (or similar) would
make it easier to read.

I'll listen to other's suggestions/voices but personally I think that
_ctx, _data etc. suffixes actually make sense.

And that's why line_data or line_request_data do make sense IMO.

I meant the fact that it can refer to multiple lines while being
called "struct line". I do find this misleading.
