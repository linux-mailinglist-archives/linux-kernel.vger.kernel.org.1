I think the swapout throughput may be affected.  Because HDD seek is
necessary to swapout for multiple CPUs, if per-cpu cluster_next is used.
But I just realized that per-cpu swap slots cache will cause seek too.
If we really care about the performance to use HDD as swap, maybe we
should disable per-cpu swap slots cache for HDD too?

Yes.  Thanks for pointing this out.  Will delete this in the future
version.

These may be spread more evenly with
(p->highest_bit/num_possible_cpus()).  I just worry about the possible
situation that num_possible_cpus() >> num_online_cpus().  Where current
method works better?

Yes.  That sounds reasonable.  How about something as below,

When per-cpu cluster_next is assigned, if the new value is in a
different 64MB (or larger) trunk of the old value, we will assign a
random value between p->lowest_bit and p->highest_bit to per-cpu
cluster_next.

This can reduce the possibility of collision to be almost 0 if there's
enough free swap slots.  And this is easy to be implemented, especially
considering the following situation,

  (p->highest_bit - p->lowest_bit) / 64MB < num_online_cpus()

I think per-cpu is enough.  Because this is a scalability issue, as long
as we work on different 64MB trunks on different CPUs, the scalability
will be good.  I don't find there's any value to use differnt 64MB
trunks on a single CPU.

Huang, Ying
