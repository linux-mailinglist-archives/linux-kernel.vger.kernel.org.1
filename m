There used to be a giant BUG() and comment somewhere in the PI code I
think.. but that's vage memories.

That's like almost a decade ago ...

I suffer much the same problem.

So cenceptually there's the problem that idle must always be runnable,
and the moment you boost it, it becomes subject to a different
scheduling class.

Imagine for example what happens when we boost it to RT and then have it
be subject to throttling. What are we going to run when the idle task
is no longer elegible to run.

(it might all work out by accident, but ISTR we had a whole bunch of fun
in the earlier days of RT due to things like that)
