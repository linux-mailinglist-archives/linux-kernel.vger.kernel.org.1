Thanks for the pointer -- I've subscribed to that now.

Just to check my understanding, is the issue that generated functions
don't implicitly get function attributes like
"branch-target-enforcement", and so the BTI insertion pass skips those?

I'm guessing that it's unlikely this'll be fixed for an LLVM 11 release?
On the kernel side I guess we'll have to guard affected features as
being incompatible with BTI until there's a viable fix on the compiler
side. :/

Thanks,
Mark.
