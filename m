Good Day,

I am Dr. Gerald Van Luven and I work as a financial consultant and 
adviser
to Global Asset Management company LLC and some High Net worth 
individuals
from the MENA region and European Union.

Basically, my principals are interested in investing in projects that 
are
viable and has capacity of generating a reasonable ROI for the investor.

I MUST consider you a privileged entity who shall be privy to many
sourcable CLEAN fund meant for foreign investment and you are able to
access up to One Billion Euro or more if your project is viable.

I will wish that you send a copy of your highlighted projects with
elucidated BUSINESS PLANS or EXECUTIVE SUMMARY which I shall propagate 
for
its immediate approval for a minimal ROI return on investment which you
shall have sole mandate after review and consideration.

You should also bear in mind that funding of this nature is not 
completed
on email communication alone, there will be the need for a face to face
meeting with the investor or His representatives and have the paperwork
perfected and signed.

Kindly reply as soon as possible if you have any viable project that you
will want us to be involved as indicated above.

Thanks

Dr. Gerald Van Luven
