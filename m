Not optimizing for them, but rather defending against them.  Uladzislau
gave the example of low-memory phones.  And we have quite the array
of defenses against other userspace bugs including MMUs, the "limit"
command, and so on.

There have been quite a few successful attempts, starting from the
introduction of blimit and RCU-bh more than 15 years ago, continuing
through making call_rcu() jump-start grace periods, IPIing reluctant
CPUs, tuning RCU callback offloading, and many others.  But these prior
approaches have only taken us so far.

Other approaches under consideration include making CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT
unconditional and thus allowing call_rcu() and kvfree_rcu() to determine
whether direct calls to the allocator are safe (some guy named Linus
doesn't like this one), preallocation (Uladzislau covered this, and
the amount that would need to be preallocated is excessive), deferring
allocation to RCU_SOFTIRQ (this would also need CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT),
and deferring to some clean context (which is the best we can do within
the confines of RCU, but which can have issues with delay).

So it is not the need to address this general problem that is new.
Far from it!  What is new is the need for changes outside of RCU.

Again, this "optimization" is for robustness more than raw speed.

But in the close(open()) case, wouldn't the allocations on the open()
side refill those caches?  Yes, cases where one CPU is doing the
allocating and another the call_rcu()/kvfree_rcu() need additional
help, but as Uladzislau noted, we do have patches that ensure that the
refilling happens.
