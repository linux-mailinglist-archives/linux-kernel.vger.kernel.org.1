Those are a little different in that they are warnings based on kernel
command line parameters.

I can understand the argument against adding a new warning for this.
You could even argue that this condition has existed since the time
hugetlb was added to the kernel which was long ago.  And, nobody has
complained enough to add a warning.  I have even heard of a sysadmin
practice of asking for a ridiculously large amount of hugetlb pages
just so that the kernel will allocate as many as possible.  They do
not 'expect' to get the ridiculous amount they asked for.  In such
cases, this will be a new warning in their log.

As mentioned in a previous e-mail, when one sets nr_hugepages by writing
to the sysfs or proc file, one needs to read the file to determine if the
number of requested pages were actually allocated.  Anyone who does not
do this is just asking for trouble.  Yet, I imagine that it may happen.

To be honest, I do not see this log message as something that would be
helpful to end users.  Rather, I could see this as being useful to support
people.  Support always asks for system logs and this could point out a
possible issue with hugetlb usage.

I do not feel strongly one way or another about adding the warning.  Since
it is fairly trivial and could help diagnose issues I am in favor of adding
it.  If people feel strongly that it should not be added, I am open to
those arguments.
