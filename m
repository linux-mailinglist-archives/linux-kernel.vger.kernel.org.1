Yes they definitely can.

I think I can enumerate all the possibilities on 64-bit, but I don't
know all the possibilities on all the 32-bit variants.

Right. On P9 radix we have an address-out-of-page-table-range exception
which I guess is similar, though that does end up at bad_page_fault() in
our case.

Yes.

We broke that a few times when developing the KUAP support, which is why
I added bad_kuap_fault() to report the case where we are in a uaccess
region but are being blocked unexpectedly by KUAP.

Not implicitly.

We manually save it into pt_regs on the stack in the exception entry. On
64-bit it's done in kuap_save_amr_and_lock. 32-bit does it in
kuap_save_and_lock.

And then on the return path it's kuap_restore_amr() on 64-bit, and
kuap_restore on 32-bit.

I'll annotate what happens for the 64-bit case as it's the one I know
best:

         - mtspr(SPRN_AMR, 0)	// 0 means loads & stores permitted

         - pt_regs->kuap = mfspr(SPRN_AMR)

Yeah I think it is.

The range handling on 32-bit books follows the same pattern as above,
except that on exception entry we don't save the content of an SPR to
pt_regs, instead we save current->thread.kuap. (Because there isn't a
single SPR that contains the KUAP state).

cheers
