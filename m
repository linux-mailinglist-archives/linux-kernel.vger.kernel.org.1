None of us have time for this, hence why I think putting us all in one entry
with all of the files listed there makes the most sense; then people do
whatever they can and try to help each other out based on how much time they
have. I think that's much better than fine-grained maintainership where a
given file has a single point of failure.

So I think it should include:

  tools/perf/arch/arm64/
  tools/pmu-events/arch/arm64/

along with the SPE and Coresight files.

Arnaldo would still handle the patches, so this is really about giving us a
chance to review incoming patches without having to fish them out from the
lists.
