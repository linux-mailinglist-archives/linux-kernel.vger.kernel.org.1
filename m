I took the first 2 patches now, that was easy :)

I think we need more review for the rest of the series.  This does
change the way serial ports work in a non-traditional way (i.e. using
sysfs instead of terminal settings).  So I want to get a bunch of people
to agree that this is ok to do things this way now before taking this
new user-visible api.
