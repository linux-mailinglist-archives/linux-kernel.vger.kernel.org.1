I am confused now. This was already taken by Moritz, wasn't it? And
the dependencies were already taken, weren't they? Previously it was
depending on "Modularization of DFL private feature drivers" and "add
dfl bus support to MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE()"... now this is here so did
the dependencies change? What is the reason to include this patch
here?

My ack was for the purpose of taking it via Moritz tree, because of
the dependencies. If this is not the case, then probably better to
take it via memory controllers tree to avoid any conflicts (it's not a
small change).

Best regards,
Krzysztof
