No, you're right. The oldest gcc we support is 4.8 and that eats -msse2
just fine.

Yeah, he's been schooled now :)

Yeah, we had another issue recently with a funky compiler on some funky
distro:

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CAEJqkgi3w%2BzvMkRBP4VtAewX1UJxrVNRQ03MtRN_yH-PwOOScQ@mail.gmail.com

and I have to say, I'm not at all happy about such subtle issues
stemming from how a distro builds its compiler and that having an impact
on the kernel build. But I guess this is the new reality now since we're
getting more and more married to the compiler.

"pasta'd"- mmhmhm, tasty noodles. Good idea for lunch tomorrow, thanks!
:-)

But sure, if you feel bored. Let it soak a while first, though, until
all the builders and bots have seen it and haven't triggered moar funky
build errors.

Thx.
