AFAICS do_tee() in its current form is not something you should be
making available to anything else, because the file mode checks are
performed in sys_tee() instead of in do_tee(). (And I don't see any
check for file modes in your uring patch, but maybe I missed it?) If
you want to make do_tee() available elsewhere, please refactor the
file mode checks over into do_tee().

The same thing seems to be true for the splice support, which luckily
hasn't landed in a kernel release yet... while do_splice() does a
random assortment of checks, the checks that actually consistently
enforce the rules happen in sys_splice(). From a quick look,
do_splice() doesn't seem to check:

 - when splicing from a pipe to a non-pipe: whether read access to the
input pipe exists
 - when splicing from a non-pipe to a pipe: whether write access to
the output pipe exists

... which AFAICS means that io_uring probably lets you get full R/W
access to any pipe to which you're supposed to have either read or
write access. (Although admittedly it is rare in practice that you get
one end of a pipe and can't access the other one.)

When you expose previously internal helpers to io_uring, please have a
look at their callers and see whether they perform any checks that
look relevant.
