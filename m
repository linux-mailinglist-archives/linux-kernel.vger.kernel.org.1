Thanks for your comment.

I will improve the patch log and try to make it easily understand.

When the KEXEC_SIG_FORCE is not enabled, even if kexec kernel image doesn't
have the signature, or the key, etc, kexec should be still allowed to loaded,
unless kexec lockdown is executed.

This is the current situation, and we'd like to change it so that kexec allows
the kernel and initrd images to be loaded when they are not the lockdown or 
mandatory signature.

Currently, kernel will always verify the signature without the lockdown or
mandatory signature. This may prevent the kernel from loading the kernel and
initrd images via the kexec_file_load() syscall. However, we'd like to allow
to still load the images in such case rather than failure due to the signature
verification issue.

For example, at the stage of development and test, usually use a signature
key to test whether the procedure of signature can work well as expected.
Sometimes, the signing time may be expired, but still use the kernel with
the old signature key to reproduce some problems in some automatic tests,
which always caused the failure of loading images.

Let's clean the logic of kernel code and allow to still load the kernel and
initrd images without the lockdown or mandatory signature.


Hope this helps.

Thanks.
Lianbo
