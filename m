v1 --> v2:
Although it's simpler to delete the empty "dma-ranges" property, and the function
of_translate_one() in drivers/of/address.c will treate non "dma-ranges" case as
empty "dma-ranges". But as Arnd Bergmann suggested: it's not good for the scenario
of IOMMU disabled or absented.

This version make sure that the node have empty "dma-ranges" property have the same
"#address-cells" and "#size-cells" values as its parent node.


v1:
The following errors occured no matter which YAML file I executed on arm64.
Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate it so that people's time and energy are
not wasted every time.
