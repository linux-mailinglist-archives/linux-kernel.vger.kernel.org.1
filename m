I was hoping to get an Ack from Will or Catalin for my most recent
arm64 patch [1] and then it could land in your tree.  However, it
wouldn't be the end of the world if that landed later.  "kgdbwait"
would be broken if you used it together with "kgdb_earlycon" but
overall we'd still be in a better place than we were.

Right, that would be OK.  Nobody would actually be able to use
"kgdb_earlycon" until those landed but there would be no problem with
those two landing separately.

It would be nice for it to be explicit, but "get_maintainer" says that
Greg KH is the maintainer of serial drivers.  Git log confirms that he
also has been the one landing changes to these files.  Early-on he
provided his Reviewed-by for the series as a whole, so he's aware of
it and maybe would be fine w/ the serial changes landing through the
kgdb tree?

Greg: is that correct?

It feels to me that the kgdb tree is the best destination for all
these patches if possible.
