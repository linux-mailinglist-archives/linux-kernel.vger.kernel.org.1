Which interface to use for events? That is a good question and probably
this should be bring to the linux-input mailinglist. I think that
linux-input maintainers could have idea how to do it properly. We need
some interface which would be general enough and usable also by other
drivers / components and I'm sure that ACPI/WMI is not the only
subsystem which needs to send events from kernel to userspace.
