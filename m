Maybe I'm not making myself clear enough here: I'm talking about using
a *special* MCE signature which says "your mapping has disappeared from
underneath you." Maybe a bit in MCi_MISC which the hw doesn't use. Or
some other deprecated bit, whatever.

If that signature is unique you won't have to check for hypervisor - you
*know* it comes from it.

Because the hypervisor would be telling the guest: "I have removed the
page from under you, you should act accordingly" with that signature. Vs
the kernel going with the unspecific "am I running as a guest"?

See the huge difference?

See above. Below too. I actually got two.

Yes, and that new machine check should tell the guest: "do not CLFLUSH
this address - I've unmapped it and you don't have to do anything."
Basically what your hypervisor check does but *actually* stating why it
raised the second MCE.

... or not inject the second MCE at all.

That would be fixing it in the HV.

Because there's this other way to look at it and come to think of it,
fixing this in the HV makes a lot more sense. Why?

Well, let me elaborate:

The hypervisor just removed that page under the guest's feet and if that
hypervisor wants to support unenlightened guests which cannot even deal
with pages disappearing from under their feet, then that hypervisor
better not inject that second MCE.

Why would it even inject the MCE - what can the guest even do about
it? Exactly *nothing*. The page is unmapped and gone, the guest cannot
salvage any information anymore from it.

And yes, the hypervisor has *all* the information, it knows which page
it just removed so if the guest tries to access memory which HV just
poisoned and is within the range which was covered by that page, then it
should *not* inject that MCE. The guest can't handle it and why would it
inject it - it is an access to a poisoned page which the HV *knows* it
won't succeed so why bother?

The HV simply returns without injecting the MCE and so on, until the
4K page's end. It simply ignores guest accesses to the poisoned page.
Without any guest changes.

Yes, if the 4K page just went away, marking it UC doesn't make any
sense.
