I had a look at that branch and gave it a quick spin on my Firefly 
RK3288 and didn't notice any issues.

I can't see anything wrong with this commit, but equally in my DTS I 
have a "regulator-always-on" for vdd_gpu. My initial thought was that 
this could be runtime PM of the GPU - but I can't see how 
panfrost_device_suspend() would end up turning off the regulator. So 
unless there's some way that the regulator itself suspends (but it 
should know it's in use) I've no clue why this would be happening.

Since you've got a reproduction - can you get a backtrace where the 
regulator is getting disabled?

Sorry, my knowledge of the cooling framework is very limited. What 
you've got looks plausible, but I'm afraid I can't really help beyond 
that! As before - can you try adding some printk()s in e.g. 
of_devfreq_cooling_register_power() and find out where it is bailing out?
