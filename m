I don't think any of the binary distros ship big endian ARM64. There are
a couple of users that tend to build everything from source using Yocto
or similar embedded distros, but as far as I can tell this is getting less
common over time as applications get ported to be compatible with
big-endian, or get phased out and replaced by code running on regular
little-endian systems.

The users we see today are likely in telco, military or aerospace
settings (While earth is mostly little-endian these days, space is
definitely big-endian) that got ported from big-endian hardware, but
often with a high degree of customization and long service life.

My policy for Arm specific kernel code submissions is generally that
it should be written so it can work on either big-endian or little-endian
using the available abstractions (just like any architecture independent
code), but I don't normally expect it to be tested on big endian.

There are some important examples of code that just doesn't work
on big-endian because it's far too hard, e.g. the UEFI runtime services.
That is also ok, if anyone really needs it, they can do the work.

I definitely want all randconfig kernels to build without warnings,
and I agree with you that making it just fail at build time is not
a good solution.
