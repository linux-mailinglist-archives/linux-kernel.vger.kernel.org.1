Hi Dan, and everybody,

Thank you for the patch.

I've been pondering about this statement for several weeks now, sleeping
over it for far longer than I usually do. Despite this, I haven't been
able to shake off my initial feeling. Hence this reply.

This e-mail isn't challenging the proposed change to the kernel coding
style policy. That's a question that I believe has been widely discussed
behind closed doors, with also a few attempts to debate it publicly in
this mail thread. While that process causes me concern, that's a
separate topic, and I'm not questioning here the usefulness or
desirability of the change. I strongly believe in a welcoming and
inclusive kernel community, and in the need to translate these words
into actions.

The part that initially offended me is the claim that with this change
the "Linux kernel project has done its small part". I can't help feeling
this sounds hypocritical at best, and cynical at worst. Can we, as the
Linux kernel community, claim that taking this small and symbolic first
step would be enough ? I won't try to speak about the impact this coding
style policy change could have on people who today feel discriminated by
our practices, but I can only imagine that stating we "will have done
our part" could infuriate more than one, the same way I feel insulting
that companies raise rainbow flags during Pride week as a means of cheap
advertising.

Do we feel enough discomfort about our own racism to be compelled to
express public sympathy, but nowhere close enough to go further ? I feel
this would be fairly shameless, considering our community collaborates
with large companies that refuse to condemn hate speech. I don't know if
I'm the only one to see an elephant in the room here, but I think we
need to have a real debate about all the other actions we can take to
make a bigger difference.
