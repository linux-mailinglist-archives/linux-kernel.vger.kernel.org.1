The rpmsg_ns service does not use this structure. So seems to me not at the good place

The virtio_rpmsg.c does, and a vhost_rpmsg.c should do it as well.
I would be in favor of moving it to rpmsg_internal.h to expose it to
the rpmg_buses (e.g. rpmsg_vhost) as a generic message header.
Leaving it in virtio_rpmsg_bus.c also seems also a good alternative.

That seems reasonable, very simple to change this in future if needed.
