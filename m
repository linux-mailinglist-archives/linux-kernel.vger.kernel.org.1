Hi Mike,

Thanks again for looking at this.

Sounds good to me, but if the coresight_unregister() is the trouble 
point
causing these crashes, then can't we just remove that from 
tmc_shutdown()
callback? This would be like maintaining the same behaviour as now where
on reboot/shutdown we basically don't do anything except for disabling 
ETR.
This way, we do not have to introduce any new mode as well. To be exact, 
in
tmc_shutdown() we just disable ETR and then return without unregistering
which should not cause any issues since this is shutdown not the remove
callback which is a requirement for making coresight modular like below:

static void tmc_shutdown(struct amba_device *adev)
  {
          unsigned long flags;
          struct tmc_drvdata *drvdata = amba_get_drvdata(adev);

          spin_lock_irqsave(&drvdata->spinlock, flags);

          if (drvdata->mode == CS_MODE_DISABLED)
                  goto out;

          if (drvdata->config_type == TMC_CONFIG_TYPE_ETR)
                  tmc_etr_disable_hw(drvdata);

          /*
           * We do not care about coresight unregister here unlike remove
           * callback which is required for making coresight modular 
since
           * the system is going down after this.
           */
  out:
          spin_unlock_irqrestore(&drvdata->spinlock, flags);
  }


Thanks,
Sai
