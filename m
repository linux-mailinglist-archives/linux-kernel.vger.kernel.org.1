The problem with all those out-of-tree kernel debugging projects is that
they are even further away from the changes in upstream they need to
adjust to over and over again. It's already hard for scripts/gdb to keep
up as only few people are aware of the dependencies, and it's always
easy to forget. But it's getting better and better here IMHO. And that
was my idea behind pushing things into upstream.
