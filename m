No, no and no.

If you look up other discussions (especially the very first one) on such 
patches, you'll see that *I react to change requests with improved* 
(shortened) patches.

*I do them manually* and I've no problem with doing things manually, I 
just automate everything that is possible.

*I don't demand to accept my patches as-is.* The only thing I demand is 
letting me focus on one thing at a time.
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/6/27/64
You requested reanimatig a dead link. That's a legit thing, but it's 
*another* thing. Another than (the yet not done task of mine of) just 
HTTPSifying URLs.

And as it's the only URL here, of course the whole patch makes no sense 
anymore. If I'd replace the URL as you said, I'd make a *new patch* with 
a *new title* and just send it --in-reply-to here. And my statement 
"just forget [the old] patch" would still stand.

Also IMAO in this particular case *I don't deserve* to be the author of 
the new patch as *you did all the work* for it – i.e. figured out the 
replacement URL.
