Hi,

Prepare and Complete are callbacks defined as part of Sleep and Resume 
sequence

Entering PM SUSPEND the phases are : prepare --> suspend --> 
suspend_late --> suspend_noirq.
While leaving PM SUSPEND the phases are: resume_noirq --> resume_early 
--> resume --> complete.

The reason to push drm suspend handling to PM prepare phase is that 
parent here will trigger a modeset to turn off the timing and 
subsequently the panel.
the child devices should not turn of their clocks before parent unwinds 
the composition. Hence they are serialized as per the sequence mentioned 
above.

A similar approach is taken by other driver that use drm framework. In 
this driver, the device registers for prepare and complete callbacks to 
handle drm_suspend and drm_resume.
