I=E2=80=99m not sure whether I should apologize or feel proud of my ability t=
o injure your eyeballs at a distance.  In my defense, I looked for helpers l=
ike this by grepping for _ONCE and didn=E2=80=99t find _once.  I suppose I s=
hould have remembered that this helper existed.

Thanks for the fixup!=
