You were a bit faster with the other patches ;-) I was still
experimenting the the patches, but let me briefly respond here.

__no_sanitize_coverage won't work, because neither compiler has an
attribute to disable coverage instrumentation. I'll try and add this
to compilers, but KCOV_INSTRUMENT := n is in the right places right
now it seems. More on that in the patch adding this.

We'll probably need to bump the required compiler version if anybody
still attempts to use these old compilers with sanitizers. The precise
versions of compilers and what mixes with what is a bit of a
nightmare. For now I'd just say, let's add the attributes, and see
where that gets us. Surely it won't be more broken than before. ;-)

I don't think it's realistic to maintain a GCC plugin like that
indefinitely. We can investigate, but it's not a quick fix.

We have all attributes except __no_sanitize_coverage. GCC <= 7 has
problems with __always_inline, so we may just have to bump the
required compiler or emit a warning.

I was stuck on trying to find ways to emulate __no_sanitize_coverage
(with no success), and then agonizing which patches to send in which
sequence. ;-) You made that decision by sending the KCSAN noinstr
series first, so let me respond to that with what I think we can add
for KASAN and UBSAN at least.

Thanks,
