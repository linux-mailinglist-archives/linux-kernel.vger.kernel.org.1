thanks and agree all the thinking here. For the 0-day ci side, we will
be very careful, since the mechanism for us is to notify newly introduced
problems from developer's patch, this can allow relatively min effort
to solve the new problems.

The other consideration is we test a lot of developer's tree and mailing
list before they are upstream, we also hope such shift left testing can
expose these warnings in new patches before maintainer's trees. Of course,
there're extra reports due to W=1 against stable or mainline, while the
number is small comparing to developer and mailing list part.
