Yes. It is waiting for dt_overlays one way or another. I personally
don't currently have the bandwidth to work actively on this.

We've looked into this sort of patches over the years and never came to
a general interface that really works.

The OPAE folks (and other users I know of) usually use FPGA Manager with
a higher layer on top of it that moves the bitstream into the kernel via
an ioctl().

One concept I had toyed with mentally, but haven't really gotten around
to implement is a 'discoverable' region, that would deal with the
necessary re-enumeration via a callback and have a sysfs interface
similar to what the patch below has.
This would essentially cover use-cases where you have a discoverable
device implemented in FPGA logic, such as say an FPGA hanging off of
PCIe bus that can get loaded over USB, a CPLD or some other side-band
mechanism. After loading the image you'd have to rescan the PCIe bus -
which - imho is the kernel's job.

What I really wanna avoid is creating another /dev/fpga0 / /dev/xdevcfg
that completely leaves the kernel in the dark about the fact that it
reconfigures a bit of hardware hanging off the bus.

In my ideal world you'd create a pci driver that binds to your device,
and creates mfd style subdevices for whatever you'd want your design to
do. One of these devices would be an FPGA and a FPGA region attached to
that FPGA manager. Your top level driver would co-ordinate the fact that
you are re-programming parts of the FPGA and create / destroy devices as
needed for the hardware contained in the bitstream.
