Remember that the rpmsg_device_id name takes some space within here. So,
the shorter the rpmsg_device_id table name, the more room you have.

I am mostly using it to provide a unique instantiation name. In anycase,
I have cross-checked against my current firmwares, and so far all of
them happen to have the name + desc < 31 bytes.

Yeah ok. I have managed to get my downstream drivers that use the desc
field working with this patch after modifying the firmwares to publish
using combined name, and adding logic in probe to get the trailing
portion of the name.

So, the only thing that is missing or content for another patch is if we
need to add some tooling/helper stuff for giving the trailing stuff to
rpmsg drivers?
