HI Dongdong,

There are two method to make the buckets being filled faster.
1) use larger non-spinning backing device (e.g. a md raid0 with multiple
SSDs).
2) specify larger read block size and small write block size in fio

Or you may combine them together to fill the cache device faster.

Previous testing on tiny SSD size is much better than this time, I
cannot provide my opinion before a non-optimized-configuration testing
finished.

If the latency distribution has no (recognized) difference, it will mean
your patch does not improve I/O latency. I believe this is only the
testing is unfinished yet.

The idea to heuristically estimate bucket fragmentation condition is
cool IMHO, but we need solid performance number to prove this
optimization. Please continue to finish the benchmark with real hardware
configuration, and I do hope we can see recoganized positive result for
your goal (improve I/O latency and throughput for high bucket dirty
segmentation).


Thanks.
