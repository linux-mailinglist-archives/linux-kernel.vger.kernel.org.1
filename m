hmm - so I think you are saying there is then no need to change the
calling functions themselves - its still 'pr_debug()'. You could even
use the 'format' qualifier for example to implement your groups that
way.

For example:

pr_debug("failure type1: blah");
pr_debug("failure type2: blah blah");

and then do: ddebug_exec_queries("format type1 +p", module);

I would be curious to see what Stanimir thinks of this proposal
and whether it would work for his venus driver, which is what
prompted this module group discussion.

Thanks,
