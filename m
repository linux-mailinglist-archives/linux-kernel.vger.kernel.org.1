Indeed, I had not understood that this was a requirement. I will add a 
patch on top of this one introducing a new config, I have to think about it.

But even if I understand that the new level of indirection coming with 
PIE will be slower, is this new config worth it ? Can we benchmark 
somehow the performance loss ? IMHO I think that this config will get 
broken over time by lack of testing because I believe distributions will 
go for KASLR kernel which requires the relocatability property anyway.
