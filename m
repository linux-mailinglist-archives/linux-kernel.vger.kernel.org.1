I don't dispute it will not happen, my point is that, without a new
revision planned, we don't have enough information to tell which option
would be best to support future revisions. As I know we won't be blocked
(both compat string matching and adding new optional properties with
appropriate defaults will be viable options), I'm not concerned.
