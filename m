Good Day Dearest One,

I pray this mail finds you in a state of your sound health and
indomitable spirit. Please, I would like to confide in you for your
honesty and truth for progress, I feel quite safe dealing with you in
this important Project.

Let me introduce myself to you, I am MRS.MARIA DEL PILAR REZOLA from a
40 years period of marriage life without produce any child or
pregnant, my late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I
inherited some part of his business and money in
the bank.

The doctor has advised me that I may not live for more than three
months and 2 weeks and warn me to stop from thinking over who is going
to inherit me and the wealth. Based on that, today I have decided to
donate and contribute to the less privileges, charity homes, and
orphanage homes and to those displaced by wars going on in the
middle-east and around the world Covid 19 damages. I made this
decision after listing to the news line about 100 years old woman who
secretly donated her fortune and wealth upon her death, follow up on
this you-tube bellow:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8o-e-iLsUM

I choose you after much prayers as I'm devoted christian and always
doing the right thing as I have the confident in you because I have
prayed over it.

I am willing to donate the sum of $20.5million U.S dollars, to the
less privileged of which you will be responsible in taking care of the
disbursement and sharing of this money to organizations that I will
appoint. Meanwhile, you will also get 30% of the money which will be:
six million one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($6,150,000) as
your compensation for helping me fulfill this desire of donation.

But the gold bars quantity of (950 kg) which worth ($28.5Million US
Dollars) will go for building companies in our name for memorial
propose, Please I want you to note that this fund is still in the bank
where my late husband deposited it.

I am going to advice my lawyer to change my last will to your name and
file in an application for the transfer of the money in your
name.change the documents of the gold also in your name: astley, I
honestly pray that this money and gold when transferred to your
account will be used for the said purpose even though I am late then
or alive, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition is
not always the final thing in life or death if you do not help people
as well when they need it.

please bear it in mind that that all the money and the gold will
rightfully belong to your name as quickly as I get your reply, and I
made the promise to god that the fund will be used to help the needy
and the less privilege.

May the grace of our lord the love of god and the fellowship of god be
with you and your family, please further discussion contact me with my
private email address as follows:
(mrs.maria.del.pilarrezola07@gmail.com).

I await kind response and my regards to your family.

Remain Blessed,
Mrs.MARIA DEL PILAR REZOLA
