Subject: [PATCH v12 9/9] kdump: update Documentation about crashkernel

For arm64, the behavior of crashkernel=X has been changed, which
tries low allocation in DMA zone, and fall back to high allocation
if it fails.
We can also use "crashkernel=X,high" to select a high region above
DMA zone, which also tries to allocate at least 256M low memory in
DMA zone automatically.
"crashkernel=Y,low" can be used to allocate specified size low memory
in DMA zone.
For non-RPi4 platforms, change DMA zone memtioned above to DMA32 zone.

For x86 and arm64, we introduce threshold for the required memory.
if required size X is too large and leads to very little free low
memory after low allocation, the system may not work well.
So add a threshold and go for high allocation directly if the required
size is too large. The threshold is set as the half of low memory.

So update the Documentation.
