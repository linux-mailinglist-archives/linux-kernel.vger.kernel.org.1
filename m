Renamed version here:

although I haven't psyched myself up to write yaml yet.

Ok, sounds like we should at least get to a position where we can enumerate
things, though.

This is only a concern if KVM chooses to provide the Rx/Tx buffer pair
though, right? If we punt that down the road for the moment, then we can
just rely on FFA_RXTX_MAP for now.

I'm referring to in-kernel users in the host kernel. For KVM-managed guests,
we may not need these, although signalling things like system shutdown might
be better off done without relying on userspace. But my point is really that
separating the buffer management from the users means we can serialise
consumers, whether they are in-kernel or out in userspace.

Ok, please let me know if you have any more questions.
