What i meant was, that file was taken as a template & nothing more, at
same time i wanted to give credit to that file, i will explicitly
mention it next time.

It is not meant to deduplicate it. Functionality here is completely
different.

In the case here, there would be different virtual address mapping
that CPU will be see once in Kernel as compared to user mode.

Here a facility is provided to access the user page, when the
current virtual address mapping of the CPU excludes it. This
is for providing full 4G virtual address to both user & kernel on
32bit ARM to avoid using highmem or reduce the impact of highmem,
i.e. so that Kernel can address till 4GiB (almost) as lowmem.

Here assumption is that user mapping is not a subset of virtual
address mapped by CPU, but a separate one. Upon Kernel entry ttbr0
is changed to Kernel lowmem, while upon Kernel exit is changed back to
user pages (ttbrx in ARM, iiuc, equivalent to cr3 in x86)

Now realize that i am unable to put coherently the problem being
attempted to solve here to a person not familiar w/ the issue
w/o taking considerable time. If above explanation is not enough,
i will try to explain later in a better way.

i am not following you here, for my case !CONFIG_64BIT case in that
file was required, hence only it was picked (or rather not deleted)

i was not aware of it, will use it as required.

Okay

yes better to move there

Okay, i will check

The reason it was there was because of copy-paste :), passing unsigned
long as 'void *' or 'const void *' requires casting right ?, or you
meant something else ?

now i checked removing the cast, compiler is abusing me :), says
'makes pointer from integer without a cast'

Okay

Yes, surely, intention was to post proof-of-concept ASAP, perhaps
contents will change drastically in next version so that any
resemblence of arch/um/kernel/skas/uaccess.c might not be there.
