I'm concerned if the physical address gets mapped with different=20
cacheability attributes where that ordering is not enforced by cache=20
coherency

 "The PAT allows any memory type to be specified in the page tables, and=20
 therefore it is possible to have a single physical page mapped to two=20
 or more different linear addresses, each with different memory types.=20
 Intel does not support this practice because it may lead to undefined=20
 operations that can result in a system failure. In particular, a WC=20
 page must never be aliased to a cacheable page because WC writes may=20
 not check the processor caches." -- Vol. 3A 11-35

Maybe I'm over thinking it, and this would never happen anyway because=20
if anyone were to map a RAM page WC, they might always have to ensure=20
all processor caches are flushed first anyway so perhaps this is just a=20
non-issue?

Thanks,
Nick
