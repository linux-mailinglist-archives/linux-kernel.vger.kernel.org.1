To do so would require solving the halting problem.

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem

Or perhaps reading the DWARF output of the compiler to determine if it
optimized the location you are looking for.

The first case is impossible to solve, the second would take a lot of
work, (are you going to fund it?)

Your comment about tracing internals is valid, but if you can't
understand the optimization of the compiler on the kernel, I suggest
you stick with the static trace events. kprobes can be added virtual
anywhere in the kernel. It's very function requires a kprobe *user* to
understand the internals of the kernel as well as its executable binary
code, and not expect the kprobe to figure it out for you.

We are all for adding infrastructure to make kprobes easier. But
figuring out that the kernel optimized a function call so that we can
add some wrapper to *simulate* the optimized out function call is
something I believe is out of scope for a kprobe. In fact, I would call
that a feature! I would like to know that a function was optimized out.
When I add a kprobe, I'm more interested in what the compiler actually
did to the kernel than what the source code shows us. That is very
useful information.
