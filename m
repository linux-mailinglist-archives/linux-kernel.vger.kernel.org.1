Side-note, we have the same issue with work scheduled when GPU
completes a batch/submit.. I'm less sure what to do with that, so
figured I'd start with the commit_work because that was the "easy"
part ;-)

The retire_work tends to complete quickly, so maybe sched_set_fifo()
is sufficient.  (That plus these days things that run android tend to
have 8 cores so you can kinda get away with multiple things at the
same RT priority level to some degree..)
