I can just reapeat what I said before: we will not be changing
inheritance behavior. It will break userspace.

And there's more problems.
Changing oom_score_adj is usually guarded by CAP_SYS_RESOURCE. It
doesn't seem like the change here adresses that in the code or in the
commit message. So from what I can tell this change here means, that a
parent process that has a "always kill" or "never kill" oom score can
spawn children that don't. That's at least surprising and at worst a
potential security issue.

In addition, given that you assign OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN to
oom_score_adj_min you also seem to basically allow the child process to
set /proc/<pid>/oom_score_adj to whatever low value after fork the
process sees fit without requiring CAP_SYS_RESOURCE basically enabling a
process to set itself to never be killed even though it's parent might
have been in "always kill" mode. See in fs/proc/base.c:

if ((short)oom_adj < task->signal->oom_score_adj_min &&
		!capable(CAP_SYS_RESOURCE)) {
	err = -EACCES;
	goto err_unlock;
}

Excuse my french but that's crazy and a security issue imho.

So we won't be taking this patch, sorry!

For future patches, you should also explain why you need this change.
The commit message here makes it seem you're asking for that change
without any specific reason. That's not just against expectations but
also problematic here because this is a uapi change where we're usually
very strict.
