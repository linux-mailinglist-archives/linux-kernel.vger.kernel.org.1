Append to the 2nd paragraph: 'pinctrl-8' is the current maximum found
in dts files.

My initial thought was I'd expect the dependencies to be uniform
across pinctrl-%d properties as each one is supposed to be a different
mode of the same set of pins. However, the dra7 pathologic cases don't
follow that exactly with the higher speed MMC modes having an
additional i/o delay controller setting.
