I do have the same pet peeve and I'm thinking we should just revert
644592d32837 ("objtool: Fail the kernel build on fatal errors") which
would ease most of the pain.  Those fatal errors don't really buy us
much IMO.  Agree?

It's an interesting idea, but it might have its own share of annoyances.

If you added something bad to a file, and just rebuilt that file, you
wouldn't see the objtool warning until later when you build the entire
kernel.  (Of course the same complaint would apply to vmlinux.o
validation.)  But the warning shows the .o file, which could be
confusing.

And for localized testing where you don't want to rebuild everything,
you'd have to figure out which archive belongs to the .o file you want
to run objtool on.  And then rebuilding that archive manually might not
work, for example I have no idea what's going wrong here:

  $ make arch/x86/kernel/built-in.a
    CALL    scripts/checksyscalls.sh
    CALL    scripts/atomic/check-atomics.sh
    DESCEND  objtool
    AR      arch/x86/kernel/built-in.a
  ar: arch/x86/kernel/fpu/built-in.a: No such file or directory
  make[2]: *** [scripts/Makefile.build:387: arch/x86/kernel/built-in.a] Error 1
  make[1]: *** [scripts/Makefile.build:488: arch/x86/kernel] Error 2
  make: *** [Makefile:1723: arch/x86] Error 2


Though I do really like Ingo's idea for parallelizing things for
vmlinux.o.
