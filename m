Agreed with above points. What do you think about
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200922190859.GH12990@dhcp22.suse.cz. I assume
that you do not want to override memory.high to implement this because
that tends to be tricky from the configuration POV as you mentioned
above. But a new limit (memory.middle for a lack of a better name) to
define the background reclaim sounds like a good fit with above points.
