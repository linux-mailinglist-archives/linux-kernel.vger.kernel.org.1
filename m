If the whole bailout is guarded by CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT specific atomicity
check then there is no functional problem - GFP_RT_SAFE would still be
GFP_NOWAIT so functional wise the allocator will still do the right
thing.

As I've tried to explain already, I would really hope we can do without
any new gfp flags. We are running out of them and they tend to generate
a lot of maintenance burden. There is a lot of abuse etc. We should also
not expose such an implementation detail of the allocator to callers
because that would make future changes even harder. The alias, on the
othere hand already builds on top of existing NOWAIT semantic and it
just helps the allocator to complain about a wrong usage while it
doesn't expose any internals.
