Nicholas wrote a patch that attempted to resolve the issue by adding every
CRTC into the commit to use use the stall checks. [1] While this forces
synchronisation on commits, it's kind of a hacky method that may take a
toll on performance.

Is it possible to have a DRM helper that forces synchronisation on some
commits without having to add every CRTC into the commit?

Also, is synchronisation really necessary for fast updates in amdgpu?
I'll admit, the idea of eliminating the use-after-free bug by eliminating
the use entirely doesn't seem ideal; but is forcing synchronisation on
these updates that much better?
