I personally think it's fine as it is but as it might help users if we
reported ESRCH something like the patch below might do.
Actual cleanup of the notifier should still happen in
seccomp_notify_release() imho, and not in __poll_t both conceptually and
also because f_op->release() happens on finaly fput() which punts it to
task_work() which finishes when the task returns from kernel mode (or
exits) - or - if the task is not alive anymore just puts it on the
kernel global workqueue which is perfect for non-high-priority cleanup
stuff. It's better than making __poll_t heavier than it needs to be.
Unless there's an obvious reason not to.
