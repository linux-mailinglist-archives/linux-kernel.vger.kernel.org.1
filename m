Well, the KUNIT configs are kinda of a special case, since normally
they don't have a lot of huge number of dependencies, since unit tests
in general are not integration tests.  So ideally, dependencies will
mostly be replaced with mocking functions.  And if there are *real*
dependencies that the Kunit Unit tests need, they can be explicitly
pulled in with selects.

That being said, as I said, I'm not picky about *how* this gets
achieved.  But ease of use is a key part of making people more likely
to run the unit tests.  So another way of solving the problem might be
to put some kind of automated dependency solver into kunit.py, or some
way of manually adding the necessary dependencies in some kind of
Kunitconfig file that are in directories where their are Unit tests,
or maybe some kind of extenstion to the Kconfig file.  My main
requirement is that the only thing that should be necessary for
enabling the ext4 Kunit tests should be adding a single line to the
.kunitconfig file.  It's not fair to make the human developer manually
have to figure out the dependency chains.

As far as I'm concerned, ease of use is important enough to justfy
special casing and/or bending the rules as far as "select" is concered
for Kunit-related CONFIG items.  But if someone else want to suggest a
better approach, I'm all ears.
