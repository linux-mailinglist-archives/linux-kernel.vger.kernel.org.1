If the device has both front and rear mics and only one can be active at
once that seems obvious and sensible.  If the devices only have one of
these then this seems like a bad idea.

I don't understand what "logic scattered in various dtsi files" means,
sorry.

Richard was looking at some basic configuration for PLLs.

The CODEC change is going to be described in the DT no matter what -
you'll have a reference to the CODEC node but it may make sense if
there's enough custom code around it.  For front vs rear mic the
simplest thing would just be to not mention which if this is a hardware
fixed thing, otherwise a control.

I don't recall having suggested distinguishing these things with a
compatible string, especially not the microphones.  UCM can already use
the display names for the boards to distinguish things.
