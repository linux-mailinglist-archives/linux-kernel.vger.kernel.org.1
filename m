We renamed it J32 because although the patents have expired the trademarks have
not, and provoking Renesas' lawyers more than necessary seemed gratuitous.

It's actually been feature complete for years now, but we've never ported the
kernel to it. (Rich has been working on a kernel port since new year's though.
Jeff Garzik sponsored some engineering time in our 2021 budget to finally get
that done, which has been our blocker for publishing because the lab tests don't
guarantee we won't have to change bits of the API in response to real world loads.)

Alas I'm not in charge of what is cleared for public release. (I complain about
it on the weekly calls from time to time.) We have actual marketing people now
(Mike and Bunga) so I'm not supposed to do the website in raw stylesheet-less
html with vi anymore.

Unpublished stuff we _mean_ to publish is a form of technical debt. It
_shouldn't_ be (release early release often) but Jeff insists on doing
everything in Mercurial which makes dogfooding our github repos as part of our
normal process darn awkward, and once there a little out of sync with the rest
of the build it becomes a todo item...
