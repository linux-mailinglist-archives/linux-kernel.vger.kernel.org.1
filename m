I've just set this off on an Raspberry Pi 4 running a locally-built
arm64 v5.10 defconfig. I'm using a SATA SSD mounted via a USB-SATA
adapter. I'll try to give that a few reboots see if I can reproduce the
issue.

Just to check -- how is your ext4 fs mounted? Mine is mounted as:

 /dev/sda2 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro)

... and are you using defconfig or something else?

Just in case the compiler has some impact, can you way which compilers
you've been using? On the rpi4 I'm using GCC 8.3.0 as packaged by Debian
Buster (10.7).

Thanks,
Mark.
