But struct file is always associated with a single file descriptor,
it's not the case for struct line. I would be fine with this name if
it was an object representing a single line like in libgpiod's
gpiod_line.

struct line sounds as if it represented a single line, struct
line_data is more ambiguous and can be understood both ways IMO.
