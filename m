Thanks for doing this: I think there are quite a few tests which could
benefit from something like this.

I think there were actually two separate questions: what do we do with
unexpected messages (most of which I expect are useless, but some of
which may end up being related to an unexpected test failure), and how
to have tests "expect" a particular message to appear. I'll stick to
talking about the latter for this thread, but even there there's two
possible interpretations of "expected messages" we probably want to
explicitly distinguish between: a message which must be present for
the test to pass (which I think best fits the "expected message"
name), and a message which the test is likely to produce, but which
shouldn't alter the result (an "ignored message"). I don't see much
use for the latter at present, but if we wanted to do more things with
messages and had some otherwise very verbose tests, it could
potentially be useful.

The other thing I'd note here is that this proposal seems to be doing
all of the actual message filtering in userspace, which makes a lot of
sense for kselftest tests, but does mean that the kernel can't know if
the test has passed or failed. There's definitely a tradeoff between
trying to put too much needless string parsing in the kernel and
having to have a userland tool determine the test results. The
proposed KCSAN test suite[1] is using tracepoints to do this in the
kernel. It's not the cleanest thing, but there's no reason KUnit or
similar couldn't implement a nicer API around it.

Is having a nice way to handle expected messages the only thing
holding up porting this to KUnit?
