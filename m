Agree, sampling is an important measurement for perf, we should integrate it
to perf as soon as possible after overflow interrupt mechanism is standardized.

It seems that the document mentioned some hook functions, it is good for me to
reserve this document, maybe we could try to give some modification. I
would check that. Thanks
