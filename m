Lyra,

Copying a reply I sent to Orson who sent me this patch privately this
morning with some additional information.

ISTR the reason that this was dropped was because of the a problem with
the way systemd read the kernel's timestamps.  It got the attention of
Linus, and it was then pulled from the tree.

I need to go back and review the entire thread as it's been several years
since we had the discussion although ISTR someone mentioning that doing two
timestamps would not be a problem for systemd.

For example,

[48551.015086]

would be

[48551.015086] m[xxxx.xxxx]

for the monotonic clock timestamp, and

[48551.015086] b[xxxx.xxxx]

for the boottime clock, etc.

P.
