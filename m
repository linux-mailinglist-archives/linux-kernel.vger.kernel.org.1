It wasn't in the queue which I queued up because that was based on
5.8-rc4.  Linus was a bit grumpy (fairly so) because it was late, and
that's totally on me.

He has said that he's going to start ignoring pull requests that
aren't fixes only if this becomes a pattern, so while I can send him
another pull request which will just have that one change, there are
no guarantees he's going to take it at this late date.

Sorry, when you sent me the commit saying that the changes that were
needed were already upstream on August 3rd, I thought that meant that
they were aready in Linus's tree.  I should have checked and noticed
that that in fact "ext4: flag as supporting buffered async reads"
wasn't compiling against Linus's upstream tree, so I didn't realize
this needed to be handled as a special case during the merge window.

Cheers,
