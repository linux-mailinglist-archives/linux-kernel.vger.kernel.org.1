Mostly the problem doesn't occur very often and likely
isn't worth much effort.

Combinations aren't common in git logs and arbitrary
combinatorial logic isn't trivial.

For the last million commits, only ~3000 have any combination
and almost all of those are Reported-and-tested-by:

Likely that could be added to $signature_tags and the problem
just ignored.

I'd still exempt signature lines from line length limits.
