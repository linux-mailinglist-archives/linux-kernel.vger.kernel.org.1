Will update it to MHI host.

I say assumption because we act based on the "graceful" flag passed by
the MHI controller driver. Link may be accessible but the controller has
instructed MHI not to do any further accesses. They may decide to set 
the
flag as "false" if they see any read/access issues, an actual link down
interrupt from the bus driver or a sideband GPIO signal declaring that a
software assert occurred on the device.

MHI host sees that power down attempt as ungraceful and assumes that the
controller has decided that it's either a link down or a fatal error.

Once an "ungraceful" power down attempt is made, MHI host moves to the
LD_ERR_FATAL_DETECT pm_state and without this patch, it moved from an
LD_ERR_FATAL_DETECT to SHUTDOWN_PROCESS state, where SHUTDOWN_PROCESS
is defined as a register accessible state by the MHI_REG_ACCESS_VALID()
macro.

If someone were to do a call that needed a register access from their
.remove() callback, for example, we could see a bus error.

Moves from MHI_PM_M3 to SHUTDOWN_PROCESS and LD_ERR_FATAL_DETECT to
SHUTDOWN_PROCESS are not allowed by use of this patch.

I'll add better wording and explanation.

Sure. I will add that.
