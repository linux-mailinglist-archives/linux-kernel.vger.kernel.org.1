Given that you guys have just reiterated yet again that you are very
unhappy with either a GFP_ flag or a special function like the one that
Peter Zijlstra put together, it would be very helpful if you were to at
least voice some level of support for Thomas Gleixner's patchset, which,
if accepted, will allow me to solve at least 50% of the problem.

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200928233041.GA23230@paulmck-ThinkPad-P72/
	Patch series including Thomas's patchset.
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201001210750.GA25287@paulmck-ThinkPad-P72/
	Corresponding pull request.

							Thanx, Paul
