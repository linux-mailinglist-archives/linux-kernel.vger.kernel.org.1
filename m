Awesome and don't worry, I'm pretty sure we've all been stubborn
occasionally :-)

From a drivers/gpu pov I think still not quite there since we also
want to see the compiler for these programmable accelerator thingies.
But just having a fairly good consensus that "userspace library with
all the runtime stuff excluding compiler must be open" is a huge step
forward. Next step may be that we (kernel overall, drivers/gpu will
still ask for the full thing) have ISA docs for these programmable
things, so that we can also evaluate that aspect and gauge how many
security issues there might be. Plus have a fighting chance to fix up
the security leaks when (post smeltdown I don't really want to
consider this an if) someone finds a hole in the hw security wall. At
least in drivers/gpu we historically have a ton of drivers with
command checkers to validate what userspace wants to run on the
accelerator thingie. Both in cases where the hw was accidentally too
strict, and not strict enough.

Cheers, Daniel
