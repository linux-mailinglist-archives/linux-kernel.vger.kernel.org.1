A From: line is generally used when sending a patch authored
by someone else.

It would be better here not to use a From: line at all as you
are both the author and sender.

Also please make your first patch somewhere in drivers/staging
and not any other directory until you are familiar with the
kernel styles and tools.  kernel/ isn't really a good place
for a first patch to be accepted, though I don't see anything
wrong with this patch other than the From: line.

But whitespace only changes outside of drivers/staging and a
few other directories are generally not accepted unless sent
as a patch series along with some other change such as
refactoring or a logical change for a defect.

cheers, Joe
