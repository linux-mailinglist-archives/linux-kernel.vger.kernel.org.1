I know it's a little early to ping and that folks are busy, but I'm
getting to a bit of a time crunch to land this driver in the Chrome OS
kernel tree.  I'd prefer for it to land upstream first so I can pick
exactly what landed but if not then I'll just pick what I posted to
the mailing list.

Any chance you can give an approximate timeline for when it might land
so I can either wait a little while longer or stop waiting and just
take what I posted to the lists?

Thanks!  :-)
