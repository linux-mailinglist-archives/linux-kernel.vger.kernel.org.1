That was a poorly worded example :)

The point I was trying to make was more that one TID of a group (not cgroup!)
of tasks is just an arbitrary value.

At a single process (or pair rather) level, sure, you can see it as an
identifier of whom you want to share with, but even then you have to tag
both processes with this. And it has less meaning when the whom you want to
share with is mutltiple tasks.

The kernel doesn't care or have to track anything.  The admin does.
At the kernel level it's just matching cookies. 

Tasks A,B,C all can share core so you give them each A's TID as a cookie.
Task A then exits. Now B and C are using essentially a random value.
Task D comes along and want to share with B and C. You have to tag it
with A's old TID, which has no meaning at this point.

And if A's TID ever gets reused. The new A` gets to share too. At some
level aren't those still 32bits?

Seems that would be more flexible for the admin. 

What if you had two cgroups you wanted to allow to run together?  Or a
cgroup and a few processes from a different one (say with different
quotas or something).

I don't have such use cases so I don't feel that strongly but it seemed
more flexible and followed the mechanism-in-kernel/policy-in-userspace
dictum rather than basing the functionality on the implementation details.
