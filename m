Hi James, Borislav, and Thomas,

James: From my perspective the series is ready for consideration by the
x86 maintainers and you already included the appropriate mailing list
and cc for this series to be queued for their consideration. My
"Reviewed-by" for patch 10 should have included a "#for resctrl". It
indeed needs more reviews for the cacheinfo.h changes but I expect that
to happen during review by x86 maintainers.

Thank you very much
