We can't do anything for out-of-tree modules as they suddenly become
"higher priority" than in-tree code if you have to not do specific
changes or extra work for them.  Which is not fair at all to the in-tree
code developers at all.

With drivers/staging/ we removed the barrier for accepting any license
compliant driver, so that solved the huge majority of these issues.

That is up to you all, as you are the one preventing this from being
merged in the tree, not me :)

Again, don't make us do _more_ work for out-of-tree modules than we do
for in-tree modules, that's just crazy to expect.
