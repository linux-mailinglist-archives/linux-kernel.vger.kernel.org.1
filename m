Hi Florian,

Thanks for you feedback.

I see your point. After a quick look, I think that, practically, the
issue is with ARM32 LPAE addresses, for which phys_addr_t is a u64. So,
basically, for AArch32 systems with LPAE the 64-bit shmem_paddr gets
truncated to 32-bit when it's passed to the SMC32/HVC32 call.

To solve that, I would prefer splitting the address between two SMC
parameters (a1 = addr_lo, a2 = addr_hi), instead of imposing an
arbitrary alignment. Would that be reasonable?

The return code is actually checked at the end of the function:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8-rc4/source/drivers/firmware/arm_scmi/smc.c#L118

But in the meantime scmi_rx_callback() has already been called. Not
sure if that's intentional or a possible bug.

Well, the trusted firmware might reserve a bigger region to be used for
other service as well. In other words, the MMU of TF-A is not necessary
specifically set up for this region, but, possibly, for a bigger
general shared region.

Passing the SCMI shmem to the SMC call allows the shmem to be moved
within such bigger shared memory without modifying the trusted
firmware.

Yes, that's a possible solution, but it looks more complicated to me,
since it adds an additional component (the boot loader) to the
equation, while the goal of this patch was to reduce the coupling
between components (namely the DT/kernel and the trusted firmware).

I guess my question is: if we fix the handling of LPAE addresses and
the SMC return code, what is the drawback of having the shmem address
passed to the SMC?

Anyway, I should have mentioned this in the commit message (sorry for
not doing so), but I submitted this patch because initial feedback from
Sudeep was positive [1]; but if there is no consensus around it I'm
fine with dropping it.
