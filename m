Subject: [PATCH V6 0/5] Add APSS clock controller support for IPQ6018
Date:   Wed, 27 May 2020 17:54:47 +0530

The CPU on Qualcomm's IPQ6018 devices are primarily fed by APSS PLL and XO,
these are connected to a clock mux and enable block.

This patch series adds support for these clocks and inturn enables clocks
required for CPU freq.

[V6]
 * Split mailbox driver from this series, mailbox changes will sent as a
   separate series
 * Addressed review comments from Stephen
[V5]
 * Addressed Bjorn comments on apss clk and dt-bindings
 * Patch 2 depends on a53 pll dt-bindings
   https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-clk/msg48358.html  
[V4]
 * Re-written PLL found on IPQ platforms as a separate driver
 * Addressed stephen's comments on apss clock controller and pll
 * Addressed Rob's review comments on bindings
 * moved a53 pll binding from this series as it is not applicable, will send
   it separately.
[V3]
 * Fixed dt binding check error in patch2
   dt-bindings: clock: Add YAML schemas for QCOM A53 PLL
[V2]
 * Restructred the patch series as there are two different HW blocks,
   the mux and enable belongs to the apcs block and PLL has a separate HW
   block.
 * Converted qcom mailbox and qcom a53 pll documentation to yaml.
 * Addressed review comments from Stephen, Rob and Sibi where it is applicable.
 * Changed this cover letter to state the purpose of this patch series
