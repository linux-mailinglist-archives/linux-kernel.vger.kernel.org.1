So that's in the case of offloading, right? Well, I don't think we'd
need to even disable bh nor lock nocb. We just need the current CPU
to see the local update of cblist->offloaded = CBLIST_OFFLOADING
before the kthread is unparked:

    cblist->offloaded = CBLIST_OFFLOADING;
    /* Make sure subsequent softirq lock nocb */
    barrier();
    kthread_unpark(rdp->nocb_cb_thread);

Now, although that guarantees that nocb_cb will see CBLIST_OFFLOADING
upon unparking, it's not guaranteed that the nocb_gp will see it on its
next round. Ok so eventually you're right, I should indeed lock nocb...

Ah it's called using work_on_cpu() which launch a workqueue on the
target and waits for completion. And that whole thing is protected
inside the barrier mutex and hotplug.

Mutual agreement! :-)

Thanks.
