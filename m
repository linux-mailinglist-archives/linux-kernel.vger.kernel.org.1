Interesting, we have a discussion going on about a related
(while at the same time almost orthogonal) discussion for
setting policies for if the code managing the restraints
(which on x86 is often hidden in firmware or ACPI DPTF tables)
should have a bias towards trying to have as long a battery life
as possible, vs maximum performance. I know those 2 aren't
always opposite ends of a spectrum with race-to-idle, yet most
modern x86 hardware has some notion of what I call performance-profiles
where we can tell the firmware managing this to go for a bias towards
low-power / balanced / performance.

I've send a RFC / sysfs API proposal for this here:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pm/20201003131938.9426-1-hdegoede@redhat.com/

I've read the patches in this thread and as said already I think
the 2 APIs are mostly orthogonal. The API in this thread is giving
userspace direct access to detailed power-limits allowing userspace
to configure things directly (and for things to work optimal userspace
must do this). Where as in the x86 case with which I'm dealing everything
is mostly handled in a black-box and userspace can merely configure
the low-power / balanced / performance bias (*) of that black-box.

Still I think it is good if we are aware of each-others efforts here.

So Daniel, if you can take a quick look at my proposal:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pm/20201003131938.9426-1-hdegoede@redhat.com/

That would be great. I think we definitely want to avoid having 2
APIs for the same thing here. Again I don't think that is actually
the case, but maybe you see this differently ?

Regards,

Hans


*) bias might not always give the correct impression at least
on some Thinkpads switching from balanced (which they call medium)
to performance boosts the long time power-limit from aprox.
15W to 25W which as expected results in a significant performance
boost.

Note usually we have no idea what the black-box knob which we are
tweaking actually does, all we know is that it is there and
Windows 10 often has a slider to configure it and users want
the same functionality under Linux.
