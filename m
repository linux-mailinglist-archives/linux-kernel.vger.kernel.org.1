Sorry, I for confused (again) by the cpufeature code :) I'm going to add
the following to my comment:

However, I think we really want to get rid of ftr_generic_32bits[] entirely
and spell out all of the register fields, even just using comments for the
fields we're omitting:

Longer term, I think we'll probably want to handle these within
ARM64_FTR_BITS, as we may end up with features that we want to hide from
KVM guests but not from the host kernel.
