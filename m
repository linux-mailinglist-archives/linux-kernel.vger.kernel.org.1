I'm thinking that it helps nothing other than telling the possible 
hypervisors "we have a new feature SLD enabled in kernel, but you seem 
not aware of it. To avoid something wrong with you and your VMs, you are 
not allowed to be loaded. Please tell me sld_safe as your assurance to 
get approval"

It's actually the bug/issue of hypervisor and it does no harm to (host) 
kernel. We can just leave it to hypervisor developer that they need to 
fix the bug in their hypervisor.

If we go the way like this patch, then whenever someone reports a 
similar bug due to new feature introduced and enabled in the future, we 
add a new xxx_safe module info?
