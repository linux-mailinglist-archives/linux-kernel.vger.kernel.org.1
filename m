If SCMI is to be accepted as a standard (which I hope), it has to
support most kinds of controllers, but currently the implementation is
too myopic. It is only a matter of time, when someone sees value in
reusing firmware implementation (scmi) but does not have a MHU like
controller.

Your logs show (in your test case), using 1 physical channel shows
better transfer (those that complete) rates than virtual channels.
The transfers that fail are purely because of this short timeout.

Increasing timeout does not increase latency.
Also scmi_xfer() can not know if it was reached from the fast_switch path.

If a platform has many users over a channel such that it can not
guarantee low enough latency, then it must not set the
fast_switch_possible flag, which is optional for this reason.

If you want to uncover remote issues, start the timeout in
tx_prepare() because that is when the message is physically sent to
the remote.

Again, increasing timeout does not slow the system down. It is to
support more variety of platform setups.

Cheers!
