OK.  I ended up adding a patch that makes our general re-entry
handling better and then relying on that since there's no other great
way to neuter the kgdb panic handler.  Then I just called panic().

NOTE: it's actually quite hard to reproduce this.  If you specify
"earlycon_kgdboc" but not "kgdboc" it'll notice at configure_kgdboc()
that the boot console vanished.  I could reproduce this by hacking
configure_kgdboc() not to do this, but otherwise it was hard.

...oh, but I did realize that there's a window where the boot console
has vanished and our init function hasn't yet been called.  That's a
pretty small window on the systems I tested, probably owing to the
fact that kgdboc itself is listed in the serial drivers and is listed
last, so it'll typically probe right after serial drivers do.  ...and
if I hit deferred probing again I should run after the deferred probe
of the serial driver I needed.  It's slightly fragile but maybe it'll
do for now.  I guess if people start hitting this panic we'll have to
figure out what to do.  If we don't want to add hooks in for the
kernel to tell us about this event we could always do something hacky
like poll every millisecond and it's probably work.  For now I'll just
document that people should use "keep_bootcon" if they end up in this
situation.

Unfortunately it's not totally trivial.  At least one problem that
feels difficult to solve is that kdb_init() (and all its
sub-functions) are marked "__init" but kgdb_register_io_module() isn't
(and can't be).

One possible solution: I could totally remove this call and things
will work fine, but only if you do "kgdbwait" or if you make sure your
code doesn't crash or hit any hardcoded kgdb_breakpoint() until
dbg_late_init() is called.  That's not totally ideal.  I'm going to
assume it's OK for me to leave the kdb_init() here.

NOTE: I believe that the existing "ekgdboc" has the same issues but
I'm not setup to use "ekgdboc" and so I haven't tested.  If you can
reproduce the "ekgdboc" issue that is there (in theory) I can also
post up a patch that'll fix that the same way...

OK.  I ended up adding a "deinit" function call and using that as an
indication that the ops are replaceable.  This cleaned up some of the
earlycon_kgdb code and seemed sane.
