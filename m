IMHO, this need to be done in a cycle until is succeeds. The previous
descriptor might get reopened or commited several times in the mean time.

I have played with the code from the original patchset in parallel
and came with alreanative solution that uses DESC_FINAL_MASK
as I originally thought. See below.

I still have to shake my head around both approaches.

Anwyay, here is my code against the original patchset:

Subject: [PATCH] printk: Alternative solution for handling non-finalized
 descriptors

The original patchset allowed to set PRB_FINAL_MASK even when PRB_COMMIT_MASK
was not set. It was used in prb_reserve() to make sure that the previous
record will always get finalized.

The result is that there are more possible combinations of the bits
and more cmpxchg calls have to be used with different combinations
of bits.

This is easy in prb_commit(). It needs to set PRB_COMMIT_MASK.
PRB_FINAL_MASK could never get removed. So it is enough to try
both possibilities in the right order.

But it gets more problematic in prb_reserve() because the previous
descriptor might get repeatedly re-reserved. It would need to
try both combinations in a cycle until it succeeds. It would
work in reality because the data block could not get extended
indefinitely. But it might make headaches when one tries
to understand the logic.

Alternative solution is to allow to set PRB_FINAL_MASK only
when PRB_COMMIT_MASK is set. This might result in a non-finalized
descriptor when PRB_COMMIT_MASK was not set when the next descriptor
was reserved and nobody later called prb_commit_finalize().

The solution is to set PRB_FINAL_MASK also from prb_commit()
when the next descriptor is already reused. The only requirement
is to set PRB_COMMIT_MASK before checking the next descriptor
to avoid race.

By other words. PRB_FINAL_MASK could be set from two locations.

    + prb_reserve() must not set it when PRB_COMMIT_MASK has not
      been set yet. But then prb_commit() must be called and
      it must see that the next descriptor has been reused.

    + prb_commit() must check if the next descriptor is already
      reused and set PRB_FINAL_MASK just in case it has not
      already been done by prb_reserve().

All new cmpxchg() are full barriers to be on the safe side.
I believe that it is necessary but I did not have time
to describe it. We might discuss it later when this approach
was used.
