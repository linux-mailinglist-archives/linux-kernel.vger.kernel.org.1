Hm, between drm_crtc_vblank_off and drm_crtc_vblank_on
drm_crtc_vblank_get should fail (and leave the refcount unchanged).
It's convoluted logic, but the check for vblank->enabled should catch
that and return -EINVAL for this case. Does that not happen?

It would indeed explain the bug (I think, I've been wrong way too many
times with this).
