That is fine. I can do quick review and Ack so you can take them
through gpio tree.

Tests and features go through subsystem trees to avoid delays. Please
make sure the test doesn't break the default kselftest build/run.

In the future it would help if you include all the maintainers on the
patch series, so I can review the tests from the framework angle to
see if they build/run correctly.
