It would mean being able to set an ESR_EL2 register value into ESR_EL1,
and there is nothing in the architecture that would allow that, with
the exception of nested virt: a VHE guest hypervisor running at EL1
must be able to observe S2 faults for its own S2, as synthesized by
the host hypervisor.

The trouble is that:
- there is so far no commercially available CPU supporting NV
- even if you could get hold of such a machine, there is no
   guarantee that such "EL2 syndrome at EL1" is valid outside of
   the nested context
- this doesn't solve the issue for non-NV CPUs anyway

Right. That's definitely a more interesting version of "swap-in".
