You should put it mostly in the commit message which will be part of the 
git log history. The cover letter, on the other hand, is not part of the 
git log.

I agree that it is a different use case. I just hope that you keep the 
possible future extension to support FUTEX_LOCK/UNLOCK in mind so that 
they won't conflict with each other.
