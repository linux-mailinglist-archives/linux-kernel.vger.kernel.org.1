Iâ€™m not too familiar with the RT kernel, but in the none RT kernel, 
this function is called in run to completion parts only, hence does not 
need a lock. Actually, this was designed in such a way that it does not 
need a lock at all.

So maybe this needs a get_cpu() instead of the light variant in the RT 
case?
