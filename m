Please also apply "[PATCH v2 1/7] arm64: dts: allwinner: h6: Add
clock to CPU cores" from the v2 series, otherwise cpufreq will
not work.

I can also send a missing patch adding the trip points, and cpu
as a cooling device, that I linked in my other reply to this patch
series afterwards, if Clément wants.

regards,
	o.
