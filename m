Enabled all the configs except "CONFIG_MODULES=n" and
"CONFIG_SHADOW_CALL_STACK=y" (can't do that via make menuconfig,
do it manually?) in the link, but still got the same warnings and
no other warnings as before, the system is in good function, please
let me know I can do anything more to help the debug.

Thanks
