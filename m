Thanks Michal.

As previously stated, I do not have a strong opinion about this.  Because of
this, let's just leave things as they are and not add the message.

It is pretty clear that a user needs to read the value after writing to
determine if all pages were allocated.  The log message would add little
benefit to the end user.
