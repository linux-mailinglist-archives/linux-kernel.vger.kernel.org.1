Hi,

Here's a V2 of my patchset that attempts to clean up the current
situation with DSI/DBI panels drivers, and tinyDRM.

For the record, here is a small sum-up of the current situation:

- the current MIPI DBI code (drivers/gpu/drm/drm_mipi_dbi.c) is lagging
  way behind the MIPI DSI code (drivers/gpu/drm/drm_mipi_dsi.c). While
  the DSI code adds a proper bus support, with support for host drivers
  and client devices, there is no such thing with the DBI code. As such,
  it is currently impossible to write a standard DRM panel driver for a
  DBI panel.

- Even if the MIPI DBI code was updated with a proper bus, many panels
  and MIPI controllers support both DSI and DBI, so it would be a pain
  to support them without resolving to duplicating each driver.

- The panel drivers written against the DBI code are all "tinyDRM"
  drivers, which means that they will register a full yet simple DRM
  driver, and cannot be used as regular DRM panels for a different DRM
  driver.

- These "tinyDRM" drivers all use SPI directly, even though the panels
  they're driving can work on other interfaces (e.g. i8080 bus). Which
  means that one driver written for e.g. a ILI9341 would not work if
  the control interface is not SPI.

- The "tinyDRM" common code is entangled with DBI and there is no clear
  separation between the two. It could very well be moved to a single
  "tinyDRM" driver that works with a DRM panel obtained from devicetree,
  because the only requirement is that the panel supports a few given
  DCS commands.

Noteworthy changes since V1:

* The DT binding document for the NV3052C panel has been updated with
  the feedback I got from V1. It now supports multiple power supplies.

* Instead of using macros to define bus types, we now have an enum
  mipi_dcs_bus_type.

* The WARN_ONE_ONCE() that were in place to check that the host and
  client drivers provided the DCS bus bitmask is gone, we just default
  to DSI instead.

* DBI/SPI driver code was moved out of drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/.

* The DBI/SPI driver is registered as a driver by each client if needed,
  they just call module_mpi_dbi_spi_driver(). This addresses the issue
  in V1 that compatible strings had to be added to two different places.

* NV3052C and ILI9341 panel drivers were updated to remove custom
  backlight handling, call drm_panel_{disable,unprepare} on module exit,
  and various small fixes.

For a more detailed changelog, see the header of each individual patch.
