I take it back. The very first place I looked seemed to do exactly that.

See "do_csum()" in the kernel. It doesn't handle carry for any of the
usual cases, exactly because it knows it doesn't need to.

Ok, so do_csum() doesn't take that initial value, but it's very much
an example of the kind of algorithm I was thinking of: it does do
things 32 bits at a time and handles the carry bit in that inner loop,
but internally it knows that the val;ues are limited in other places,
and doesn't need to handle carry everywhere.
