I haven't ran into any issues with it; I was just looking at the code
as reference for a patch I'm working on.

I initially assumed that casting a const pointer to non-const and
writing to it would be undefined behaviour, but after reading through
the C99 standard I can't find an unambiguous statement whether it is
undefined behaviour even if the const pointer points to an object that
was originally non-const (like char* -> const char* -> char* casts); it
only says it is undefined behaviour if the object was defined with the
const qualifier.

I should probably stop bothering you with my newbie questions.
