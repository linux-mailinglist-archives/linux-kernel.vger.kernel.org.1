The problem I see is that by looking at just the existing attributes,
you have no way of telling what namespace the strings are in,
and a script that tries pattern matching could confuse two
hexadecimal numbers from a different namespace, such as
pci vendor/device or usb vendor/device IDs that are similar
in spirit to the jep106 codes.

This is part of the same issue: If we put just "jep106 identified SoC"
as the "family", it would be something a driver could match against.

In most cases, the existing drivers put a hardcoded string into the
family, such as

"Samsung Exynos"
"Freescale i.MX"
"Amlogic Meson"

or slightly more specific

"R-Car Gen2"

Having a numeric identifier for the SoC manufacturer here is a
bit more coarse than that, but would be similar in spirit.

I don't think we need a real name like "Arm" or "Samsung" here,
but just a number is not enough, it should at least be something
that can be assumed to never conflict with the name of a chip
by another scheme.

jep106:5678 (the IMP_DEF_SOC_ID field in my example) would
probably be sufficient to not conflict with a another soc_device
driver, but is quite likely to clash with an ID used by another
manufacturer.

jep106:1234 (the manufacturer ID) in turn seems too broad from
the soc_id field, as that would include every chip made by one
company.
