Why should it ? Usually, the page fault handler is able to resolve the
resulting minor page faults lazily.

Who said tracing was easy ? ;-)

I know the question is not addressed to me, but here are my 2 cents:

It's subtle because ftrace is tracing the page fault handler through
tracepoints. It would not make sense to slow down all vmalloc or
percpu_alloc() just because tracing recurses when tracing page faults.

I think the right approach to solve this is to call vmalloc_sync_mappings()
before any vmalloc'd memory ends up being observable by instrumentation.
This can be achieved by adding a vmalloc_sync_mappings call on tracepoint
registration like I proposed in my patchset a few week ago:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200409193543.18115-2-mathieu.desnoyers@efficios.com

The tracers just have to make sure they perform their vmalloc'd memory
allocation before registering the tracepoint which can touch it, else they
need to issue vmalloc_sync_mappings() on their own before making the
newly allocated memory observable by instrumentation.

This approach is not new: register_die_notifier() does exactly that today.

Thanks,

Mathieu
