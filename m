hum, I dont think this will be a problem:

    Allowing top 4% of low memory (per user) to be allocated in epoll watches,
    we have:

    LOMEM    MAX_WATCHES (per user)
    512MB    ~178000
    1GB      ~356000
    2GB      ~712000

my laptop has 19841945 allowed watches per user

apart from this one I still have a problem with that stat factoring
having 1 complicated function deal with both fork and no fork processing,
which I already commented on, but you ignored ;-)

I'll try to go through that once more, and post some comments
