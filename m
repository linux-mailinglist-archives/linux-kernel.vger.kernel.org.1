I'll revisit this and try to figure it out, but I think what we have
today is still correct.  The only "problem" that people were having with
the original code is the kobject_uevent() path walk when a parent was
gone before the child.  I've sent a patch to solve that problem, so we
"should" be ok.

Unfortunatly, it turns out that the owner of the kobject in question was
assuming that it could always reach the parent when things were being
cleaned up, but it was tearing things down in the backwards order.  So
even if I did move the logic around "correctly" in this patch, it still
died a horrible death (and there was other under-run errors reported as
well by other subsystems.)

So again, I think what we have today is ok.  But I'll beat on it for a
while this week to ensure that.  Time to start using the kunit test
framework for kobjects it seems :)

Doh, ok, that makes more sense.  It's just that a apply/revert sequence
does not happen a lot that I happen to notice this when digging through
the logs for fixes.

I'll use --full-history for now on when trying to dig up stable changes,
as that should help.  But ugh, you are right, there is a lot more noise
in there, loads of merge commits that shouldn't matter.  Will add
--no-merges to the line as well, and that helps out.
