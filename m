Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: add of_match_full_name boolean flag
Date:   Wed, 19 Aug 2020 15:04:48 +0100

When an .of_match non-null string is defined in struct regulator_desc, the
regulator core searches for regulators trying to match, at first, such
string against the 'regulator-compatible' property and then falls back to
use the name of the node itself.

Property 'regulator-compatible' is now deprecated (even if still widely
used in the code base), and the node-name fallback works fine only as long
as the nodes are named in an unique way; if it makes sense to use a common
name and identifying them using an index through a 'reg' property the
standard advices to use a naming in the form <common-name>@<unit>.

In this case the above matching mechanism based on the simple (common) name
will fail and the only viable alternative would be to properly define the
deprecrated 'regulator-compatible' property equal to the full name
<common-name>@<unit>.

In order to address this case without using such deprecated property,
define a new boolean flag .of_match_full_name in struct regulator_desc to
force the core to match against the node full-name instead.
