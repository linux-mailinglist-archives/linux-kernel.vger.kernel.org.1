I dug some more into this; if I got my math right, this can be reproduced
with a single task group below the root. Forked tasks get max load, so this
can be tried out with either tons of forks or tons of CPU hogs.

We need

  p->se.avg.load_avg * cfs_rq->h_load
  -----------------------------------  < 1
    cfs_rq_load_avg(cfs_rq) + 1

Assuming homogeneous system with tasks spread out all over (no other tasks
interfering), that should boil down to

  1024 * (tg.shares / nr_cpus)
  ---------------------------  < 1
  1024 * (nr_tasks_on_cpu)

IOW

  tg.shares / nr_cpus < nr_tasks_on_cpu

If we get tasks nicely spread out, a simple condition to hit this should be
to have more tasks than shares.

I can hit task_h_load=0 with the following on my Juno (pinned to one CPU to
make things simpler; big.LITTLE doesn't yield equal weights between CPUs):

  cgcreate -g cpu:tg0

  echo 128 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/tg0/cpu.shares

  for ((i=0; i<130; i++)); do
      # busy loop of your choice
      taskset -c 0 ./loop.sh &
      echo $! > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/tg0/tasks
  done

For here and below; wouldn't it be a tad cleaner to just do

        foo = max(task_h_load(p), 1);

Otherwise, I think I've properly convinced myself we do want to have
that in one form or another. So either way:
