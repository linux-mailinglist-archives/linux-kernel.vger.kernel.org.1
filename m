That was my original suggestion, and I'm not actually sure it's invalid.  It
would mean that both the kernel's physical and virtual addresses are set by the
bootloader, which may or may not be workable if we want to have an sv48+sv39
kernel.  My initial approach to sv48+sv39 kernels would be to just throw away
the sv39 memory on sv48 kernels, which would preserve the linear map but mean
that there is no single physical address that's accessible for both.  That
would require some coordination between the bootloader and the kernel as to
where it should be loaded, but maybe there's a better way to design the linear
map.  Right now we have a bunch of unwritten rules about where things need to
be loaded, which is a recipe for disaster.

We could copy the kernel around, but I'm not sure I really like that idea.  We
do zero the BSS right now, so it's not like we entirely rely on the bootloader
to set up the kernel image, but with the hart race boot scheme we have right
now we'd at least need to leave a stub sitting around.  Maybe we just throw
away SBI v0.1, though, that's why we called it all legacy in the first place.

My bigger worry is that anything that involves running the kernel at arbitrary
virtual addresses means we need a PIC kernel, which means every global symbol
needs an indirection.  That's probably not so bad for shared libraries, but the
kernel has a lot of global symbols.  PLT references probably aren't so scary,
as we have an incoherent instruction cache so the virtual function predictor
isn't that hard to build, but making all global data accesses GOT-relative
seems like a disaster for performance.  This fixed-VA thing really just exists
so we don't have to be full-on PIC.

In theory I think we could just get away with pretending that medany is PIC,
which I believe works as long as the data and text offset stays constant, you
you don't have any symbols between 2GiB and -2GiB (as those may stay fixed,
even in medany), and you deal with GP accordingly (which should work itself out
in the current startup code).  We rely on this for some of the early boot code
(and will soon for kexec), but that's a very controlled code base and we've
already had some issues.  I'd be much more comfortable adding an explicit
semi-PIC code model, as I tend to miss something when doing these sorts of
things and then we could at least add it to the GCC test runs and guarantee it
actually works.  Not really sure I want to deal with that, though.  It would,
however, be the only way to get random virtual addresses during kernel
execution.

Ya, it terrified me as well.  Alex says arm64 puts the kernel in the vmalloc
region, so assuming that's the case it must be possible.  I didn't get that
from reading the arm64 port (I guess it's no secret that pretty much all I do
is copy their code)

I'm operating under the assumption that we don't want to add an additional load
to virt2phys conversions.  arm64 bends over backwards to avoid the load, and
I'm assuming they have a reason for doing so.  Of course, if we're PIC then
maybe performance just doesn't matter, but I'm not sure I want to just give up.
Distros will probably build the sv48+sv39 kernels as soon as they show up, even
if there's no sv48 hardware for a while.
