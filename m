Right -- that was sort of the point of my original question about the
xfstest. The fact that ceph wasn't returning ESTALE in this situation
didn't seem to be technically _wrong_ to me, but the xfstest treated
that as a failure. It's probably best to return ESTALE since that's the
conventional behavior, but I don't think it's necessarily required for
correct operation in general.

FWIW, if we ever implement O_TMPFILE in ceph, then we may need to
revisit this code. With that, you can do a 0->1 transition on i_nlink,
which blows some of the assumptions we're making here out of the water.

They do work across clients, but a file handle is just an identifier for
an inode. That's completely orthogonal to whether the file is open.
