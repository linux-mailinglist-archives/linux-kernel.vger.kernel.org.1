If they don't affect the issue you are fixing, there are good reasons
for leaving ETB./ETF running.
If a system is not completely powered down, then the static ram in
these devices can sometimes be used for post-mortem diagnosis after
re-start.

I think this use case can be handled slightly differently than the
general requirements for modular CoreSight drivers.

What is needed here is a way of stopping the underlying ETR hardware
from issuing data to the SMMU, until the entire device has been shut
down, in a way that does not remove the driver, breaking existing
references and causing a system crash.

We could introduce a new mode to the ETR driver - e.g. CS_MODE_SHUTDOWN.

At the end of the block tmc_shutdown(struct amba_device *adev), set
drvdata->mode to CS_MODE_SHUTDOWN & remove the coresight_unregister().
This new mode can be used to  prevent the underlying hardware from
being able to restart until the device is re-powered.

This mode can be detected in the code that enables / disables the ETR
and handled appropriately (updates to tmc_enable_etr_sink and
tmc_disable_etr_sink).
This mode will persist until the device is re-started - but because we
are on the device shutdown path this is not an issue.

This should leave the CoreSight infrastructure stable until the
drivers are shut down normally as part of the device power down
process.

Mike
