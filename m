So my patch is correct but the warnings I added were probably overkill.

About the warnings, Vineeth explained to me on IRC that the design was
intially done to set ->core_pick to NULL if nothing is being picked for a
sibling rq, and the fact that we don't increment that rq's core_sched_seq
means it would the rq it is being set for would not go read core_pick.

And that resetting ->core_pick should be ok, since a sibling will go select a
task for itself if its core_pick was NULL anyway.

The only requirement is that the selection code definitely select something
for the current CPU, or idle. NULL is not an option,

So I guess we can drop the additional warnings I added, I was likely too
paranoid.

Makes sense.

It occurs to us that may we want to optimize this a bit more, because we have
to copy cpumask every schedule() with my patch which may be unnecessarily
expensive for large CPU systems.  I think we can do better -- probably by
unconditionally running the selection code on the current CPU without first
preparing an intermediate mask..

Agreed, I think my patch can be used as a starting point and we optimize it
further.

Me/Vineeth will continue to work on this and come up with a final patch, thanks!
