No problem, I see them in linux-next now.  Thanks!

I've CC-ed linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org on the whole
series.  Did you mean anything else by the ARM patches queue?

Sure, in fact patch 4/4 depends on the DTS one (3/4) and also on
the l2c fix (2/4) as otherwise prefetch would actually not be
enabled.  So it sounds like both remaining ones 2/4 and 4/4 are
actually now pending Russell's ack.

Best wishes,
Guillaume
