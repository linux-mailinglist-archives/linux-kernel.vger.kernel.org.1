Alexander,
Next time, please ask if you aren't sure about including others' 
suggestions -- no need to term it as "stealing". Masami asked if you can 
include this, and I shared what I thought are the correct URLs so that 
they can be included. We don't mind someone else doing this change.

Besides, there are ways to acknowledge others, through a Suggested-by 
tag, as an example.

Sure, I will send a patch.
