All of the below is already tremendously helpful! I remember it took me
quite some time to figure out e.g. how we could observe p->on_cpu &&
!p->on_rq and why we cared about it in ttwu(). On the bright side, I'm
happy that my notes aren't completely off - there may be hope for me yet.

Have some small comments below.

Only extra thing that comes to mind is p->uclamp*; dunno how exhaustive you
want this list to be.

That's more of a good practice rather than a hard rule, right? We do that
with proxy execution (the whole migrate to owner's rq thing), at least in
its current shape.

Isn't that one under double_rq_lock()?

For some reason the alignment is off in my mail view, but looks okay once
applied.

Sorry if I'm being dense; don't you mean "running" here? If it stops being
current inbetween set_current_state() and schedule(), __schedule() will
deactivate() it, so AFAICT it can only be either running or deactivated.
