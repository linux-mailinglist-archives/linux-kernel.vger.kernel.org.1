Hello,

This patchset improves iocost in three areas to make iocost internal
operations more accurate and immediate with the goal of improving work
conservation and distribution fairness, and removing dependence on vrate
adjustments for masking work conservation issues. This improves overall
control quality and allows regulating vrate more tightly for more consistent
behavior as vrate now only needs to respond to device behavior changes.

1. Donation

iocost implements work-conservation by making under-utliized cgroups to
donate unused budgets to saturated cgroups. This approach has the
significant advantage that calculation or synchronization inaccuracies never
lead to over utilization of the device while allowing all hot path
operations to be local to each cgroup - it's inherently safe w/o needing
system-wide synchronization in hot paths.

However, this approach requires dynamically adjusting weights according to
the current usage of each cgroup. Given that a cgroup with weight X is using
only a portion of its hierarchical absoulte share, it needs to scale down X
so that the share matches the observed usage. With nesting and multiple
nodes needing adjustments at once, the math is non-trivial. The current
implementation works around the issue by trying to converge by repeatedly
under-adjusting the weight of each cgroup.

The innate inaccuracies can lead to significant errors impacting work
conservation and fairness, and the workarounds around them weigh down the
rest of the control logic.

Andy Newell devised a method to calculate the exact weight updates given the
target hierarchical shares which is described in the following pdfs.

  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PsJwxPFtjUnwOY1QJ5AeICCcsL7BM3bo
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vONz1-fzVO7oY5DXXsLjSxEtYYQbOvsE
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WcrltBOSPN0qXVdBgnKm4mdp9FhuEFQN

This patchset implements Andy's method for precise donation weight
adjustments on each period timer.

Donation amount is also adjusted during a period if the donor is running out
of budget. This mechanism used to be very coarse as donation calculations
weren't accurate to begin with. Now that donation calculations are exact,
this patchset improves in-period adjustments too.

2. Debt

Some IOs which are attributed to a low priority cgroup can cause severe
priority inversions when blocked - e.g. swap outs and filesystem metadata
IOs. These IOs are issued right away even when the cgroup doesn't have
enough budget. When this happens, the cgroup incurs debt, which the cgroup
has to pay off before issuing more IOs.

There were several issues around debt handling around how weight is adjusted
while under debt, how payment is calculated, and how anonymous memory delay
duration is determined. This patchset fixes and improves debt handling and
adds debt forgiveness mechanism which avoids extended pathological stalling
on very slow devices.

3. Excess handling

During a period, each cgroup mostly runs on its own without constantly
synchronizing with other cgroups. This often leads to excess budget which
needs to be thrown away at the end of the period, which can have negative
impact on work conservation. This is somewhat offset by vrate adjustments
but vrate compensation is delayed and can sometimes be erratic and it
prevents us from confining vrate for more consistent behavior.

This patchset implements excess vrate compensation where the effective vrate
is transparently boosted to compensate for excesses without affecting the
regular latency based vrate adjustment mechanism. This compensates for
excesses immediately and accurately and allows the regular vrate adjustment
mechanism to worry only about device behavior changes.


This patchset is on top of for-5.10/block (2b64038972e4) and availalbe in
the following git branch.
