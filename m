Is there any fundamental problem to make zone raw_spin_lock?

I do not think this is a good idea. Single purpose gfp flags that tend
to heavily depend on the current implementation of the page allocator
have turned out to be problematic. Users used to misunderstand their
meaning resulting in a lot of abuse which was not trivial to remove.
This flag seem to fall into exactly this sort of category. If there is a
problem in nesting then that should be addressed rather than a new flag
exported IMHO. If that is absolutely not possible for some reason then
we can try to figure out what to do but that really need a very strong
justification.
