I did not say panic is better, I said that while we have restart already in mainline dm-verity code,
panic() is almost the same, so I see no problem in merging this patch.

Stopping system this way could create more damage if it is not configured properly,
but I think it is quite common to stop the system as fast as possible if data system integrity
is violated...

I think Mike can fold-in version increase, if the patch is accepted.

But please include these version changes with every new feature.

Actually I am tracking it here for dm-verity as part of veritysetup userspace documentation:
  https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/wikis/DMVerity

Thanks,
Milan
