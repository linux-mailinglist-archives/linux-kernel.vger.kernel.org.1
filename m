I don't have any need for this at the moment, as my initial goal was
to enable a different boot flow for VHE. The BTI "support" was added
as a way to demonstrate the use of __read_sysreg_by_encoding(), and
your patches were a good opportunity to converge on a single solution.

But if you write the patches that do that, I can add them to the series,
and Catalin/Will can decide whether they want to take them.

Thanks,

         M.
