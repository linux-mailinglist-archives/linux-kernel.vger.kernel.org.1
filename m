RPMON is a driver framework. It supports remote processor monitor
from user level. The basic components are a character device
with sysfs interfaces for user space communication and different
kinds of message drivers introduced modularly, which are used to
communicate with remote processors.

As for user space, one can get notifications of different events
of remote processors, like their registrations, through standard
file read operation of the file descriptors related to the exported
character devices. Actions can also be taken into account via
standard write operations to the devices. Besides, the sysfs class
attributes could be accessed conveniently.

Message drivers act as engines to communicate with remote processors.
Currently RPMON_QMI is available which uses QMI infrastructures
on Qualcomm SoC Platforms.

RPMON_QMI implements a kind of communication routine for RPMON to
communicate with remote processors through QMI infrastructure.
RPMON_QMI itself is designed as a modular framework that would
introduce different kind of message sets which are binding to
different services.

RPMON_QMI creates a device of rpmon_device type for each remote
processor endpoint. All the endpoint devices share an unique set
of QMI suite.

RPMON_QMI_MSG_V01 implements a RPMON_QMI message set for connection check.
RPMON_QMI defines its message types modularly. Each rpmon service
binds to a message set and introduced as a module. This version 1.0
message set could be used for connection checking of remote processors.

RPMON_QMI messages depend on QCOM_QMI_HELPERS and should be updated
together with QMI related modules.
