I'm fine with not moving that functionality into the VFS. The problem
I have in gfs2 is that taking glocks is really expensive. Part of that
overhead is accidental, but we definitely won't be able to fix it in
the short term. So something like the IOCB_CACHED flag that prevents
generic_file_read_iter from issuing readahead I/O would save the day
for us. Does that idea stand a chance?

We could theoretically also create a copy of
generic_file_buffered_read in gfs2 and strip out the I/O parts, but
that would be very messy.

Thanks,
Andreas
