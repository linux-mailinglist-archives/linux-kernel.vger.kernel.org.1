What do you mean repeat across reboots? If it doesn't happen it wont
ever happen, but if you reboot it may have it happen again?

I haven't used arm lately, and I'm unfamiliar with atrace. So I don't
really know what is going on. If you can reproduce this with just a
shell script accessing the ftrace files, that would be much more useful.
