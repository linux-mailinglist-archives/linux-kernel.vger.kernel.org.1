1) i'll update the patch to use "drm_mode_config_helper_suspend/resume". 
This will help in additional cleanup such as enabling FBDEV emulation in 
the build.

2) For the asymmetry part,
  pm_runtime_force_resume() was not waking up the device forcefully if 
the usage count is 1. PM core thinks that if usage count is 1 then 
device can be runtime resumed after suspend/resume sequence is complete. 
This is true for all the child nodes and the parent node. Hence to 
overcome that i used pm_runtime_resume on parent.

I have explored a bit on how to handle this cleanly, found an old thread 
discussing on the similar problem 
(https://lists.gt.net/linux/kernel/1556562  post no#4 Alan Stern ) the 
suggestion was to use runtime API's directly in PM Suspend/Resume.

I have found few example implementations on similar lines.
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/msm/-/blob/msm-next/drivers/media/platform/mtk-mdp/mtk_mdp_core.c#L279
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/msm/-/blob/msm-next/drivers/media/i2c/ak7375.c#L273
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/msm/-/blob/msm-next/drivers/gnss/sirf.c#L377

I have changed the implementation on those lines in v6.

Summary of the flow now:

PM Sleep -->  pm_prepare for parent ( Disable all the DRM CRTCs) --> 
Suspend for child1, child2 ( turn off child clocks )--> Suspend for 
parent (turn off parent clocks )

PM Wakeup --> Resume for child1, child2 ( force resume is inactive due 
to usage count 1, but the call is needed to undo the force suspend 
things ) --> Resume for Parent (turn on parent clocks ) --> PM_complete 
for Parent.( By the time we reach here, PM core will remove the usage 
count for all the children and they are ready for runtime resume. Parent 
enables CRTCs which will runtime resume all the child clocks)

Let me know your views on it.
