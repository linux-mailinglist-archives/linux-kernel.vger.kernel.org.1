Yes, but this is still MFD specifc, because no other normal (in lack of
a better word, think of one-function-devices) I2C device has sub-nodes.
Thus my proposal for that simple-mfd-i2c driver. And keep in mind that
this likely isn't specific to I2C but also to SPI (without having
looked at it). So in theory that simple-mfd-i2c, could also register
a spi_driver which then registers an SPI regmap and enumerates the
children. So this is not only an I2C topic, but IMHO still MFD.
