Hm, you're probably right, I didn't check how the name was used by
nvmem. I also see that partition names can contain spaces, which is
not that great. So, if we want to use mtd->unique_name we should
probably sanitize it before passing it to nvmem. All this makes me
reconsider your initial proposal: use 'mtdX' as the nvmem name. It's
unique and it's simple enough to not require this extra sanitization
pass, on the other hand, guessing the nvmem partition based on such an
opaque name is not simple, not to mention that the mtd device name can
change depending on the probe order.

I also wonder if creating nvmem devs unconditionally for all mtd
devices is a good idea. Sounds like we should only do that if there's an
explicit request to have one partition exposed as an nvmem.

Note that, no matter what we decide about nvmem, I think having unique
names at the MTD level is a good thing.
