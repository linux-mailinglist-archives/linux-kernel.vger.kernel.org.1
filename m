Ok but the only thing I find wrong in this approach is that it is a 
redundant
information because CSV2 is already advertising the mitigation, but 
again
CSV2 check is done first so it doesn't really hurt to add it to the safe
list because we already know that it is safe.

Sorry but I don't see how the guest kernel will see the CSV2 bits set 
for
gold CPU cores without actually adding them to the safe list or reading 
the
not sanitised value of ID_AA64PFR0_EL1 ?

Thanks,
