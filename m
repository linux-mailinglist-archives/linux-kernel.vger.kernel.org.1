Thanks for testing! I'm glad that appears to work, as it suggests
there's not another massive problem lurking in this area.

While cleaning/splitting that up today, I spotted a couple of new
problems I introduced, and I'm part-way through sorting that out, but
it's not quite ready today after all. :/

Fingers crossed for tomorrow...

Hmm... I suspect that arch_cpu_idle() is being traced here, and I reckon
we have to mark that and its callees as noinstr, since it doesn't seem
sane to have ftrace check whether RCU is watching for every function
call. Maybe Paul or Steve can correct me. ;)

If you still have the binary lying around, can you check whether
default_idle_call+0x94/0x38c is just after the call to arch_cpu_idle()?
If you could dump the asm around that, along with whatever faddr2line
tells you, that'd be a great help. 

This looks like it should be reproducible, so I'll enable the boot-time
self tests in my kernel and check whether I see the above too.

Thanks,
Mark.
