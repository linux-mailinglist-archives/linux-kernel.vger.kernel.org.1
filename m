Yes, that series of latency_nice seems to be in good shape to be used for
any usecases. Hopefully, OSPM will lead to its upstreaming sooner :-)
But at the end, we aim to have both the per-task and cgroup based interface
to mark the latency_nice value of a task.
Till, then I'm finding some generic use-cases to show benefits of such task
attribute to increase community interest.


Thanks,
