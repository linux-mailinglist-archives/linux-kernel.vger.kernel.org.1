I think you are persuading me.

Although I can think of plenty of places where it isn't safe to step I'm
struggling to think of any way for us to end up stopped in the debugger
in those places and certainly now without setting the catastrophic
(which is the only safety rail currently extant).

That means I don't think I can put up a strong enough case that this
patch is better than doing nothing!

I'll drop it for now.

I think on the whole you've expressed things more lucidly than I have!
Nevertheless...

... when we stop on the first instruction of a function then we have not
actually executed any part of it. In other words we haven't executed
anything on the blocklist.

Of course the whole issue is moot for now.
