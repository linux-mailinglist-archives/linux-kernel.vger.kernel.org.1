Linus just pointed me at this thread.

If you could run:
	echo -n 'module xhci_hcd =p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
and run the same workload to see if anything shows up in the log when
xhci crashes, that would be great.

Although if you are using an "older version" of the driver, there's not
much I can suggest except update to a newer one :)
