As you say, a UUID to the kernel is a binary blob except for input,
which to the kernel is INIT_UUID or INIT_GUID and output, which is
either printk %Ub for uuid_t or %Ul for guid_t.

The bit I objected to was doing a %Ul on a uuid_t because it's going to
trip the static checkers.  That shows me there's a confusion in the
code between little and big endian UUID types, but I haven't looked
further than that.
