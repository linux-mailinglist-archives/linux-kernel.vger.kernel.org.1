To me it's always seemed like there are two major divisions among THP =
use
cases:

1) Applications that KNOW they would benefit from use of THPs, so they
call madvise() with an appropriate parameter and explicitly inform the
kernel of such

2) Applications that know nothing about THP but there may be an
advantage that comes from "automatic" THP mapping when possible.

This is an approach that I am more familiar with that comes down to:

    1) Is a VMA properly aligned for a (whatever size) THP?

    2) Is the mapping request for a length >=3D (whatever size) THP?

    3) Let's try allocating memory to map the space using (whatever =
size)
       THP, and:

        -- If we succeed, great, awesome, let's do it.
        -- If not, no big deal, map using as large a page as we CAN get.

There of course are myriad performance implications to this. Processes
that start early after boot have a better chance of getting a THP,
but that also means frequently mapped large memory spaces have a better
chance of being mapped in a shared manner via a THP, e.g. libc, X =
servers
or Firefox/Chrome. It also means that processes that would be mapped
using THPs early in boot may not be if they should crash and need to be
restarted.

There are all sorts of tunables that would likely need to be in place to =
make
the second approach more viable, but I think it's certainly worth =
investigating.

The address selection you suggest is the basis of one of the patches I =
wrote
for a previous iteration of THP support (and that is in Matthew's THP =
tree)
that will try to round VM addresses to the proper alignment if possible =
so a
THP can then be used to map the area.
