I think I'm more confused now :-/

Where do we use ->owner after event creation? The moment you create your
eventN you create the link to sink0. That link either succeeds (same
'cookie') or fails.

If it fails, event creation fails, the end.

On success, we have the sink pointer in our event and we never ever need
to look at ->owner ever again.

I'm also not seeing why exactly we need ->owner in the first place.

Suppose we make the sink0 device return -EBUSY on open() when it is
active. Then a perf session can open the sink0 device, create perf
events and attach them to the sink0 device using
perf_event_attr::config2. The events will attach to sink0 and increment
its usage count, such that any further open() will fail.

Once the events are created, the perf tool close()s the sink0 device,
which is now will in-use by the events. No other events can be attached
to it.

Or are you doing the event->sink mapping every time you do: pmu::add()?
That sounds insane.
