Hi Christoph,

That had slipped my mind - what we would have submitted would have been 
a modified /drivers/dma-heap/heaps/cma_heap.c, which would have created 
a "linux,cma-nofail" heap, that when allocated from, passes GFP_NOFAIL 
to cma_alloc().  But, since this retry approach (finite and infinite) 
has effectively been nacked, I've gone back to the drawing board to find 
either (1) a lock based approach to solving this (as posed by Andrew 
Morton here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/8/21/1490), or (2) using 
preempt_disable() calls.

Thanks,

Chris.
