I think, when preempt_rt is fully integrated to the kernel, we might get
new users with such demand. So, it is not a closed topic so far, IMHO.

I do not have a strong opinion here. Giving the fact that maintaining of
such "deferring" is not considered as a big effort, i think, we can live
with it.
