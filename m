Its probably the differences with RDT that are important, so I'll focus on those:

MPAM has has a CPU interface that controls how the CPU tags traffic, and controls that are
scattered through the system, and are accessible via MMIO.

Arm doesn't specify a cache topology, (hence we have funny terms like PoU), so likewise
the controls, and where they are in the address space, are totally up to the implementer.
Linux would have to discover all this from an ACPI-table/DT-node.

MPAM has ~six different types of control, all of which are optional. Cache Portion bitmaps
correspond closely to CAT's behaviour. MBM's behaviour can be approximated with either the
bandwidth bitmap or the bandwidth max/min controls.

MPAM has partid's, which correspond perfectly with closid. It has performance monitors,
but these behave much more like a PMU than RDT's monitors. This is where it gets messy:

RDT has RMIDs as an independent value used for monitoring. There is one monitor per RMID.
MPAM has 'PMG', that subdivide the partid space. There are a number of PMU-like monitors
that can be configured to count for a partid, or a partid-and-pmg. It is very likely that
the number of these counters is much smaller than the number of partid, or partid+pmg.

PMG does not correspond to RMID, even though they look compatible from a distance.
(I can't see a way of fixing this is a compatible way. Supporting it via a different
mechanism is my best bet).

MPAM has something like the CPU interface for tagging traffic in Arm's irqchip and IOMMU.
MPAM has virtualisation support in the CPU, for mapping virtual partids to physical partids.


> A start would be how resctrl is expected to support MPAM.

Exactly as it works on an Intel Xeon today!
User-space should not be able to tell the difference.

I intend to get as much of MPAM going with this constraint as possible. We can then
discuss what needs changing/extending to allow other features to be used. (and what those
features are good for).

Practically this means that systems with MPAM can only use resctrl if they look a bit like
a Xeon. (i.e. bitmap controls on L2 or L3, bandwidth controls on-or-behind L3)


> Could you highlight where does resctrl interface or assumptions currently fall short?
> How is the planned MPAM integration addressing these shortcomings?

(shortcomings -> Design decisions that make sense for resctrl to support RDT.)

The resctrl monitor code implicitly assumes 'this' CPU all over the place. For MPAM any
'this' CPU may be a set of CPUs, which make this code tricky to work with.

tangent: (what! why? ... Reported by more than one of Arm's partners, is that part of
their system is made up of slices, which act as one component when integrated together. I
assume this helps scale the design, or improve the yield. There is one set of MPAM
controls per slice, which means each of the controls needs to be configured the same to
give one behaviour for the component. The MPAM controls may only be accessible from the
local CPUs if this slice thing contains CPUs... Arm's software model does exactly this
with its L3).


resctrl doesn't have the concept of having to allocate a counter for an RMID, because for
RDT these things are 1:1. Because the bandwidth counters are left running, and accessible
via the filesystem, MPAM cannot let resctrl use the bandwidth counters unless there are as
many PMU-like monitors as there are partid+pmg, which isn't likely.

My plan here is to add a 'resctrl_pmu' to perf. (I know there is some history with perf
here). This would allow perf to read the values that are already exposed via resctrl.
For MPAM this should give us the schedule-in/out hooks we need to allocate the PMU-like
counter when its actually being used.

I'd expect this to be done in the core /fs/ code, so that it uses a common interface to
resctrl, and works in exactly the same way with RDT. (no additional arch code means it
works on the next architecture to support resctrl too)


The rdt_resources_all array, and these alloc_enabled, alloc_capable flags are a really
neat trick to implement CDP on RDT. But this looks very much like an array of every SoC
that has been built, which is tricky if the topology is discovered at boot. It also leaves
properties of the user visible schemata file in the hands of the arch code.
I want it to be, very difficult, for Arm to invent new schemata without discussing whether
the interface is abstract enough to support on other architectures.
A good chunk of the MPAM tree is moving all the user-visible CDP behaviour into the code
that moves to /fs. This lets the arch code only deal with L2 or L3, and CDP becomes a
property of the configuration.

(this is probably one of the stranger looking changes. Secondary motivations are to avoid
emulating CDP under arch/arm64, and avoiding the nightmare SoC topology where there are
more MPAM controls to be configured, because of this slicing, in L2 than there are in
L2CODE....)

For now, that is totally out of scope.

As you asked!
The principle here is not to change the user-visible bits of resctrl at all.

We only need to support KVM, and the definition of KVM's virtual machine (memory layout,
number of CPUs etc) comes from its user-space virtual-machine-manager, which is typically
Qemu.
KVM only needs to support the CPU-interface parts of MPAM. The controls, configured via
MMIO could be emulated by the VMM. (this lets it give an accurate model of the machine it
is emulating)
The VMM would need to allocate a number of control groups via resctrl, then pass their
names (or preferably closid) to KVM to set up the mapping. The MPAM hardware performs the
mapping when the guest uses a partid.
When the guest tries to configure the controls, this would trap back to the VMM, as it
does for any emulated device. The VMM can then make the corresponding change in resctrl.

This lets the VMM emulate MPAM controls that the host doesn't have, or control MPAM for
the guest using a different user-space interface.

This has only been discussed vaguely with the Qemu folk, its all subject to change.

I would like to be able to allocate closid in the kernel for KVM guests, as this is a step
towards supporting other in-kernel users. (in particular, the IOMMU).

No changes to the schemata! That would cause variation between RDT and MPAM, and fragment
user-space software.

The commit message is certainly terrible. That patch is part of the chunk that folds the
L3CODE, L3DATA and L3 resources together so that the arch code is only dealing with L3,
(or L2 or MBM). This is so that the CODE/DATA schema behaviour lives in the core /fs/
code, so that its much harder for it to behave differently on systems with MPAM.

Interesting. This is the change that makes the CDP on/off global, instead of per cache.
Its still controlled by user-space. (so nothing is forced).
Do you have systems that support CAT at L3 and L2, but only CDP at L3, not L2?
(I was under the impression the L2 stuff was all Atom, and the L3+MBM was all Xeon).

MPAM's equivalent to CDP is just part of the CPU interface. Its always on.
To support 'CDP on L2 but not L3', (neither of which exist), we'd need to have extra code:
"was I asked to pretend CDP is enabled on this cache".

As CDP affects the way you allocate closid, (that odd/even thing), which is global, it
makes sense that this is either on or off. (doing this let me support CDP without the arch
code doing anything special!)

Existence of hardware that does this would obviously change this.

ACPI-tables/DT to describe the topology, and then code to 'pick' which MPAM features map
best onto resctrl.
Its likely that there will be systems that have MPAM, but can't use resctrl without
user-visible changes. Discussing user-visible changes can happen at that point.

Indeed. Because there is nothing quite like RMID, there is nothing I can expose as
num_rmid. Whatever value I expose there will cause user-space to detect some breakage.

(crumbs, you've dug into this in some detail!)

... Welcome to the wonderful world of Arm specifications:

On page 234 of [0], it describes the CSU controls:
| If MATCH_PMG == 1 and MATCH_PARTID == 0, it is CONSTRAINED-UNPREDICTABLE whether the
| monitor instance:
| * Measures the storage used with matching PMG and with any PARTID.
| * Measures no storage usage, that is, MSMON_CSU.VALUE is zero.
| * Measures the storage used with matching PMG and PARTID, that is, treats
|   MATCH_PARTID as == 1.

Whenever you see something all-caps (CONSTRAINED-UNPREDICTABLE in this case), it means
this is pretty useless to general purpose software. We would need per-platform quirks for
which of these behaviours the implementer built.
"Measures the storage used with matching PMG and with any PARTID." is the one we wanted,
but the spec people made it optional, and its not discoverable.

Curiously, the text describing the bandwidth controls doesn't describe this as
unpredictable... I'll check that isn't an oversight. Being able to do this with the
bandwidth controls doesn't help, as we can't support those unless we have enough monitors
for the free-running files in resctrl.

Even if we could rely on this, we'd still have the problem that MPAM expects PMG to extend
the partid space. There may be very few PMG because they are expected to be used
per-partid. If there are fewer PMG than partid, we are straight back to square-one: 'no
monitor support'.

Today, no. Only those that map in a usable way to what resctrl already exposes to user-space.

If someone comes up with a use-case that benefits from one of the the extra controls, we
can discuss how that could be abstracted to work on multiple architectures.

I think not-at-all is the answer here. Resctrl's ABI is a ship that has sailed. Where at
all possible I intend to map what MPAM has to what resctrl exposes.

The num_rmid issue has me painted into a corner. No value there reflects the behaviour.
The only option may be not to expose any of the counters via the resctrl filesystem,
instead making them accessible via perf.
I think that would only fly if I can make it work on x86 too.

Ultimately yes, but the aim here isn't to support all of MPAM.
Its just to support what maps nicely. We can then discuss what to do next.

Yeah! Me to. But this is what Fenghua asked to see:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20180827142204.GA223688@romley-ivt3.sc.intel.com/

You'll be glad to know I have no intention of posting all that in one go (obvious, but
worth saying).

Thanks for going through this with such a level of detail. I'm sure we agree on the 'no
user-visible changes' aspect, so the next pieces is where the split between core code and
arch code should be.


Thanks,

James
