Hi Rob

That does not work in the use case i'm interested in, which is giving
a W=1 warning. Take a look at the last example in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/dsa/marvell.txt

We have an Ethernet switch, using the compatible string
"marvell,mv88e6390". Embedded within the hardware, and within the same
driver, we have two MDIO busses. One is internal, for the PHYs
integrated into the switch, and one is external, of discrete PHY
connected to the switch. The external MDIO bus has its own compatible
string. However, there is no struct driver for it, the switch driver
is driving the MDIO bus. So of_device_get_match_data() will use the
wrong match table.
