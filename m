Why do we care about optimizing the error case?

It's a simple test. Do the child devices have any dependency on the
parent to probe and/or function? If so, not a simple-bus.

Can you quantify that?

Have you run with devlinks enabled. You need a command line option to
enable. That too should reduce deferred probes.

Deferred probe only runs when a device is added, so it's not like it
is continually running.
