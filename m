This is similar in concept to a patch that did something similar except
in adjust_numa_imbalance(). It ended up being great for light loads like
simple communicating pairs but fell apart for some HPC workloads when
memory bandwidth requirements increased. Ultimately it was dropped until
the NUMA/CPU load balancing was reconciled so may be worth a revisit. At
the time, it was really problematic once a one node was roughly 25% CPU
utilised on a 2-socket machine with hyper-threading enabled. The patch may
still work out but it would need wider testing. Within mmtests, the NAS
workloads for D-class on a 2-socket machine varying the number of parallel
tasks/processes are used should be enough to determine if the patch is
free from side-effects for one machine. It gets problematic for different
machine sizes as the point where memory bandwidth is saturated varies.
group_weight/4 might be fine on one machine as a cut-off and a problem
on a larger machine with more cores -- I hit that particular problem
when one 2 socket machine with 48 logical CPUs was fine but a different
machine with 80 logical CPUs regressed.

I'm not saying the patch is wrong, just that patches in general for this
area (everyone, not just you) need fairly broad testing.
