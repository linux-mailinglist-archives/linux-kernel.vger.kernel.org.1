I think there is only one case: VMA with VM_PFNMAP set will get pre-populated during
kvm_arch_prepare_memory_region(), but they are always made device at stage2, so MTE isn't
a concern there.

It looks like its only called through set_pte_at_notify(), which is used by things like
KSM/COW that change a mapping, and really don't want to fault it a second time. I guess
they are only for PAGE_SIZE mappings.

Other mapping sizes would get faulted in by user_mem_abort().


I think this should happen in the same places as we clean new pages to PoC, as that is
also an additional piece of maintenance KVM has to do that the host's stage 1 doesn't.

You may be able to rename clean_dcache_guest_page() to encompass maintenance that we need
when a page is accessible to a different EL1.


Thanks,

James
