Well, write_stamp is updated via local64, which I believe handles this
for us. I probably should make before_stamp handle it as well.

The two terms are basically interchangeable here, but for consistency,
I will update it. Thanks.

I believe the answer is still yes. But I can run some benchmarks to
make sure.

Oops, When I first wrote this, I used "a" and "b" for "after" and
"before" and had "after" and "before" be "after_stamp" and
"before_stamp". I missed this update. Nice catch.

Hmm, you may be right. Previous iterations of this code had a distinct
difference here, but after restructuring it, I don't think that
distinction is valid anymore. If anything, having this at least lets me
validate that it's doing what I believe it should be doing (as I added
a ton of trace_printk()s into this).

Yes. I can add that for clarity, but perhaps I don't need that if I
merge the two.

My email client messed up your formatting of the rest of the email, so
I'll send a separate reply.
