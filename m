Hello! I should have been more precise about it. CLOCK_BOOTTIME and
CLOCK_MONOTONIC do not jump but I understood that they are affected by
adjtime(). So these clocks may tick faster or slower than real time. NTP
daemon when see that CLOCK_REALTIME is incorrect, it may speed up or
slow down its ticking. And this is affected also by CLOCK_BOOTTIME and
CLOCK_MONOTONIC, right?

  CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
      Similar to CLOCK_MONOTONIC, but provides access to a raw
      hardware-based time that is not subject to NTP adjustments or the
      incremental adjustments performed by adjtime(3).

I understood it that it is like CLOCK_MONOTONIC but is not affected by
adjtime() which is used by NTP daemon to slow down or speed up system
clock to synchronize it (when system clock is incorrect).

So I thought that this clock is better for time differences as measured
time would not be affected when NTP daemon speeded up system clock via
adjtime().

You wrote that this clock is subject to drifts. What exactly may happen
with CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW?

Sorry, by jump I mean that clock may be adjusted (even smoothed
adjustment).
