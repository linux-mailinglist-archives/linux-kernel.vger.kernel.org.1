I know the syzkaller guys tried to run the fuzzer with kmemleak enabled
and there were false positives that required human intervention. IIRC
they disabled it eventually. The proposal was for a new feature to
kmemleak to run the scanning under stop_machine() so that no other CPU
messes with linked lists etc. That would make kmemleak more reliable
under heavy load. Another option was to let the system cool down before
running the scanning.

I guess we don't need the full stack trace. About 4 function calls to
the refcount modification should be sufficient to get an idea.
