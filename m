The audio should have a dependency on the GPU device.  The GPU won't enter =
runtime pm until the audio has entered runtime pm and vice versa on resume.=
 Please attach a copy of your dmesg output and lspci output.

Presumably something is using the device.  Maybe a framebuffer console
or X?  Or maybe the something like tlp has disabled runtime pm on your
device?  You can see the current status by reading the files in
/sys/class/drm/cardX/device/power/ .  Replace cardX with card0, card1,
etc. depending on which device is the radeon card.

FWIW, I have a fiji board in a desktop system and it worked fine when
this code was enabled.
