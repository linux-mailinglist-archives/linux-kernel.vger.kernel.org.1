task_struct will have its own member for bpf local storage as I explained.
For most structs we won't be adding new member or even reusing lsm's security
blob pointer, because existing bpf hash table approach is fast enough and
flexible, since it can key based on anything. Any pointer and any struct can
have additional scratch area available to bpf progs. We're adding
*_local_storage only to kernel objects where performance is critical. Like
'struct sock'.

It's not about lsm and not about bpf_lsm.
The *_local_storage infrastructure is generic and available to
bpf program types where it can be done safely.
Like sk_local_storage is avaiable to ~25% of networking bpf prog types.
(not to 100% because bpf progs run in a many different contexts
and in some sock pointer is not accessibly safely).
Similarly inode_local_storage will be available to different types
of progs. Including tracing progs where it's safe.

To rephrase bpf's *_local_storage could have been used by selinux
and other lsm instead of current infra and likely would have been
faster. In that sense selinux would be seen as another bpf program.
It's not a program, of course, but it could have accessed it through
the same mechanism.
So, no, we're not "abandoning existing mechanism because it's too slow"
we've created a new mechanism because it's generic (not related
to lsm-s and security) and made it faster for all, so other kernel
bits (including lsm-s) are welcome to use it.
