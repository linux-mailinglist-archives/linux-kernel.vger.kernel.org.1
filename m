Well, Kees wants to restore the common version of cache_from_obj() [1] for SLAB
hardening.

To prevent all that back and forth churn entering git history, I think the best
is for me to send a -fix to my patch that is functionally same while keeping the
common function, and then this your patch should only have a minor conflict and
Kees can rebase his patches on top to become much smaller?
