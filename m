Gotcha. So your perspective is that the goal is actually to have no
list at all in the end, because all MSR writes should go through sysfs
interfaces and such, always? I certainly like that goal -- it'd make a
whole lot of CPU functionality a lot more discoverable and easier to
tinker with. In practice, it seems like that's a hard goal to
accomplish, with different MSRs having different semantics and
meanings of different bit offsets, and a great deal of them aren't
actually publicly documented by Intel. Were you hoping to just handle
these piece by piece, and eventually Linux will have a decent
compendium of MSRs? That sure would be nice. Is Intel on board with
that plan?
