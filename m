This patch must come first in the set so that other reviewers can read
what all this jazz is about first, before exposing them to the gory
details later.

Only the title of the document should be sandwiched between two lines of

============

as that is what appears in the documentation TOC. As it is right now,it says
"Architecture" but it should say "Software Guard eXtensions (SGX)"

Architecture should follow only with a bottom line as a section name:
