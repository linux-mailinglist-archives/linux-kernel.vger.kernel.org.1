For 'arch_freq_scale' and 'tsc_adjust' percpu variable, they are only
accessed by their own CPU, and usually no other CPU will touch them, the
hot node path only use this_cpu_read/write/ptr. And each CPU's static
percpu variables are all packed together in one area (256KB for one CPU on
this test box), so I don't think there is multiple CPUs accessing one cache
line scenario, which is easy to trigger false sharing.

Also our different test shows the test score is higher if 'arch_freq_scale'
and 'tsc_adjust' are in 2 separate cachelines.
