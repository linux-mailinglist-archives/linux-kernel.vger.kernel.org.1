Hello My Dear,

My Greetings to you, MY Dear This is my second email to you but No 
reply.
Why? Please I need a good clarification / my question is; have you 
received
your charity offer this sum of €3.8 MILLION EUROS from the 
correspondence
bank?

It's just because the donation offer this sum of €3.8 MILLION EUROS has
been registered in your name for Humanitarian & Charity works to help 
those
Less privileges and old folks living in your home town as part of rural 
&
Charity Supports in your community.

Please i need your urgent clarifications. Have you received the donation
offer or not yet?

Best Regards,
 From Mrs Helena Fredric,
Secretary of Economic & Development(OECD).
