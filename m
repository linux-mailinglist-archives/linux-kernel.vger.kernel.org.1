Yes.

I looked at that and I saw that if the get() callback is not provided,
the current frequency showed by userspace is policy->cur. For this
device, policy->cur is accurate and so if we added the get() callback we
essentially just going to return policy->cur. Therefore, given that we
already know policy->cur, I did not see the point in adding a device
specific handler to do the same thing.
