You are correct.  With range (1g-2m, 1g+2m) within a vma (0, 2g) the existing
code will only adjust to (0, 1g+2m) which is incorrect.

We should cc stable.  The original reason for adjusting the range was to
prevent data corruption (getting wrong page).  Since the range is not always
adjusted correctly, the potential for corruption still exists.

However, I am fairly confident that adjust_range_if_pmd_sharing_possible is
only gong to be called in two cases:
1) for a single page
2) for range == entire vma
In those cases, the current code should produce the correct results.

To be safe, let's just cc stable.
