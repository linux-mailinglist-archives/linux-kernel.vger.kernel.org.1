I'll try to leave only relevant parts for a question below...

Do you expect that mcount subcmd would be called on more than one object 
file at a time? I don't see a reason for that with all the Makefile 
changes, but I may be missing something (Kbuild is a maze for me).

Because if not, I think it would be nice to make record_mcount() more 
similar to what we have for check(). After Julien's changes 
(20200608071203.4055-1-jthierry@redhat.com) at least. So that 
record_mcount() could accept struct objtool_file and work directly on 
that.

It would also impact several other patches in the series. For example, 
is there a need for a private 'struct elf *lf' in mcount.c?

Thanks
Miroslav
