Probably not, I think this goes back to the long debate of whether to 
use DMA API unconditionally. If we did that, we can support legacy 
virtio driver.

The vDPA device needs to provide a DMA device and the virtio core and 
perform DMA API with that device which should work for all of the cases.

But a big question is, do upstream care about out of tree virtio drivers?

Thanks
