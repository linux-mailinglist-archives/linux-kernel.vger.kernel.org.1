The point is at b.iii where the TLBI is not enough. There are many page 
mappings that we need to merge into a block mapping.

We invalidate the TLB for the input address without level hint at b.iii, 
but this operation just flush TLB for one page mapping, there

are still some TLB entries for the other page mappings in the cache, the 
MMU hardware walker can still hit these entries next time.


Maybe we can imagine a concrete example here. If we now need to merge 
page mappings into a 1G block mapping, and the

fault_ipa to user_mem_abort() is 0x225043000, after ALIGNMENT to 1G, the 
input address will be 0x200000000, then the TLBI

operation at b.iii will invalidate the TLB entry for address 
0x200000000. But what about address 0x200001000 , 0x200002000 ... ?

After the installing of 1G block mapping is finished, when the fault_ipa 
is 0x200007000, MMU can still hit the TLB entry for page

mapping in the cache and can also access memory through the new block entry.


So adding TLBI operation in stage2_map_walk_leaf() aims to invalidate 
TLB entries for all the page mappings that will be merged.

In this way, after installing of block mapping, MMU can only access 
memory through the new block entry.

Yes, there is not a condition for now that cache attributes will be 
changed in this case.

Maybe this part of dcache flush can be cut.
