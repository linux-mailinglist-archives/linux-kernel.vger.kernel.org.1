Yeah, that could work. I meant there was no way to do it with what was there :)

In our initial attempts at using BPF to get at nr_running (which I was not
involved in and don't have all the details...) there were issues being able to
keep up and losing events.  That may have been an implementation issue, but
using the module and trace-cmd doesn't have that problem. Hopefully you don't
see that using RAW_TRACEPOINTs.


Fwiw, I don't think these little helper routines are all that hard to maintain.
If something changes in those fields, which seems moderately unlikely at least
for many of them, the compiler will complain.

And I agree with you about preferring to use the public headers for the module.
I think we can work around it though, if needed.


Cheers,
Phil
