Additionally, I don't see mentioned on-thread (it's on the bug and now
in the details below) that we're talking multi-monitor, not
single-monitor. Presumably that goes some way toward answering the "why
not force order?" question, considering the outputs may be running at
different refresh frequencies, etc...

All the reports on the bug seem to be multi-monitor (after seeing
multi-monitor/output in several reports I asked if anyone was seeing it
with only one monitor and no answers), and as you commented on the bug
for your proposed patch but seems missing from this one here (different
author/proposal) ...

Commits #1 and #2 don't touch any of the same core DRM objects (CRTCs,
Planes, Connectors) so Commit #2 does not stall for Commit #1. DRM
Private Objects have always been avoided in stall checks, so we have no
safety from DRM core in this regard.
