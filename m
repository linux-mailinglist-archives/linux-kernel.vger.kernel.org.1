Add QMP V3 USB3 PHY entries for SC7180 in phy driver and
device tree bindings.

changes in v7:
*As per Matthias comments conversion to yaml and splitting out DP PHY bindings
 patches are separated.
*PATCH v7 1/4 is for coversion to yaml.
*PATCH v7 2/4 has splitting out DP PHY bindings and adding as separate yaml
 for DP PHY  bindings.
*No changes in PATCH v7 3/4 and 4/4.

changes in v6:
*Added separate yaml file for USB3 DP PHY bindings.

changes in v5:
*Addressed comments from Matthias in yaml file.
*Dropped PATCH 4/4 as it is landed in linux-next. 

changes in v4:
*Addressed comments from Matthias and Rob in yaml file.

changes in v3:
*Addressed Rob's comments in yaml file.
*Sepearated the SC7180 support in yaml patch.
*corrected the phy reset entries in device tree.

changes in v2:
*Remove global phy reset in QMP PHY.
*Convert QMP PHY bindings to yaml.
