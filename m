This won't help. While kmemleak_alloc_phys() allows passing a physical
address, it doesn't track physical address references to this object. It
still expects VA pointing to it, otherwise the object would be reported
as a leak.

We currently only call this from the memblock code with a min_count of
0, meaning it will not be reported as a leak if no references are found.

We don't have this issue with page tables on other architectures since
most of them use whole page allocations which aren't tracked by
kmemleak. These powerpc functions use kmem_cache_alloc() which would be
tracked automatically by kmemleak. While we could add a phys alias to
kmemleak (another search tree), I think the easiest is as per Qian's
patch, just ignore those objects.
