I guess this should talk only about our own kcpuid tool since we wanna
do that now, right?

You already give the separate example for "no5lvl" below so use something else
above, say, "nofsgsbase", for example.

Another example would be: broken CPUs and them missing microcode patches
and due to that the kernel deciding not to enable a feature.

But yap, all in all looks like a good idea. I'll take the next version
after you've fixed those nitpicks.

Thx.
