I guess I still don't totally get it.  So let's say we have:

void dont_trace_this(...)
{
  thing_not_to_trace_1();
  thing_not_to_trace_2();
  don_t_trace = this;
}
NOKPROBE_SYMBOL(dont_trace_this);

void trace_me()
{
  sing();
  dance();
  dont_trace_this();
  party();
}

So presumably the dont_trace_this() function is marked as
NOKPROBE_SYMBOL because it's called by the kprobe handling code or by
kgdb, right?  So if we had a breakpoint there then we'd just have
infinite recursion.  Thus we want to prevent putting breakpoints
anywhere in this function.  Even though dont_trace_this() is also
called from the trace_me() function it doesn't matter--we still can't
put breakpoints in it because it would cause problems with the
debugger.

Now, I guess the question is: why exactly do we need to prevent single
stepping in dont_trace_this().  In the case above where
dont_trace_this() is called from trace_me() it would actually be OK to
single step it, right?  ...unless this is on a CPU that doesn't have a
"single step mode" and has to implement stepping by breakpoints, of
course.

...but maybe I'm confused and there is a reason that we shouldn't
allow single stepping into dont_trace_this() when called from
trace_me().  If that is the case, I'm wondering why it's OK to step
and stop on the first instruction of the function but it's not OK to
step and stop through the other instructions in the function.
