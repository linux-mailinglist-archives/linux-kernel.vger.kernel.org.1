I am afraid the people would see missing timestamps as a bug.
They want it because they want to corelate kernel and userspace logs.
The timestamps from realtime clock are supposed to make it
straightforward.

More importantly. I do not see a reasonable way how to handle it.
No timestamp is worse than timestamps from non-synchronized clock.
Mixing timestamps from different clocks (as fallback) would cause
a lot of confusion (more harm than good).

Yeah, I think that dict are less used on normal systems. But it might
be very different when a driver gets more verbose during debugging
and the amount of dev_printk() calls is much higher.
