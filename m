Subject: [PATCH v5 0/6] DVFS for IO devices on sdm845 and sc7180
Date:   Wed, 13 May 2020 16:42:56 +0530

Changes in v5:
1. Opp cleanup path fixed up across drivers

Changes in v4:
1. Fixed all review feedback on v3
2. Dropped the dts patches, will post as a seperate series once
driver changes are reviewed and merged.
The driver changes without DT updates to include OPP tables will
have zero functional change.
3. Dropped the mmc/sdhc patch, which is a standalone patch. will
repost if needed seperately.

Changes in v3:
1. Added better error handling for dev_pm_opp_of_add_table()
2. Some minor changes and fixes in 'PATCH 12/17' as compared to v2
3. Dropped the mmc patch picked up by Ulf [2]

Changes in v2:
1. Added error handling for dev_pm_opp_set_clkname()
and dev_pm_opp_of_add_table()
2. Used dev_pm_opp_put_clkname() in the cleanup path
3. Dropped the OPP patch pulled in by Viresh [1]
4. Dropped the UFS patches since they had some major rework
needed because of changes that were merged in the merge window
and I don't have a UFS device currently to validate the changes.

We have had support added in the OPP core for a while now to support
DVFS for IO devices, and this series uses that infrastructure to
add DVFS support for various IO devices in sdm845 and sc7180 SoCs.
