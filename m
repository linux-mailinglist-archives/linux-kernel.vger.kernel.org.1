The caveats you list are the important ones and the reason why it was
not done asynchronously. In an earlier implementation all the work was
done by a dedicated thread and ultimately abandoned.

There is no guarantee there is an idle CPU available and one that is
local to the thread that should be doing the scanning. Even if there is,
it potentially prevents another task from scheduling on an idle CPU and
similarly other workqueue tasks may be delayed waiting on the scanner. The
hiding of the cost is also problematic because the CPU cost is hidden
and mixed with other unrelated workqueues. It also has the potential
to mask bugs. Lets say for example there is a bug whereby a task is
scanning excessively, that can be easily missed when the work is done by
a workqueue.

While it's just an opinion, my preference would be to focus on reducing
the cost and amount of scanning done -- particularly for threads. For
example, all threads operate on the same address space but there can be
significant overlap where all threads are potentially scanning the same
areas or regions that the thread has no interest in. One option would be
to track the highest and lowest pages accessed and only scan within
those regions for example. The tricky part is that library pages may
create very wide windows that render the tracking useless but it could
at least be investigated.
