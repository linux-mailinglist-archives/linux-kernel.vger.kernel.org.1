 That's because I don't merge the bindings in the main branch.

 In addition to sys/gnu/dts we also have sys/dts/ which are our own DTs
before we used the Linux ones (a long time ago but some platform
weren't converted, they will just die sometime in the futur if nobody
takes care of them I guess).

 I'm not familiar with this platform at all, it was done under
contract by Semihalf and I'm sure that if something fails and their
client starts to complain they will fix it.

 I wouldn't worry about us on this case, this binding requirements
seems to have be done a long time ago before we had any clock framework
and if our drivers needs to be updated we will do it when we imports
DTS from whatever Linux version this will be merged in.

 Yes, I (and others) insist on using the DTs from Linux and not doing
any patches to it without sending them to the Linux ML.
