On second thoughts, why wouldn't a relative 'sustainable-power' value work?
On every device, one would need to do the exercise that Matthias did to come
up with the OPP at which we can sustain max CPU/GPU loads anyway.
I mean even if we do change the DPC values to match actual power, Matthias would
still observe that we can sustain at the very same OPP and not any different.
Its just that the mW values that are passed to kernel are relative and not
absolute. My worry is that perhaps no SoC vendor wants to put these absolute numbers
out.
