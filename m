Fair enough. Is anybody working on a tree-wide sweep for this, like we've
done for other things such as zero-length arrays? If so, I can start
enforcing this in the arch code as well (I haven't been so far, even though
I do run sparse on every commit).

Anyway, I've dropped the last patch from the branch, and we can put a fix
for the missing prototype on top.
