Right but I was asking specifically about the IOVA reservation introduced
by commit aadad097cd46. They are not registered as reserved regions within
the IOMMU core, they are only taken into account by dma-iommu.c when
creating a DMA domain. As VFIO uses UNMANAGED domains, it isn't aware of
those regions and they won't be seen by vfio_iommu_resv_exclude().

It looks like the PCIe regions used to be common until cd2c9fcf5c66
("iommu/dma: Move PCI window region reservation back into dma specific
path.") But I couldn't find the justification for this commit.

The thing is, if VFIO isn't aware of the reserved PCIe windows, then
allowing VFIO or userspace to choose MSI_IOVA_BASE won't solve the problem
reported by Srinath, because they could well choose an IOVA within the
PCIe window...

Thanks,
Jean
