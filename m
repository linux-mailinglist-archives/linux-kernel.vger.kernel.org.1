There are also quite some quirks which work around gcc/binutils
weirdness in the kernel. E.g. there are macros to make VFP support work
with older binutils versions.

I understand, Clang is the newcomer here. Breaking gcc/binutils is a
nogo, and functionality or maintainability should not suffer.

I think the important thing here is that whatever workarounds are
introduced that they are properly documented: Why is this required, how
does it work, and under what circumstances can it be removed again. This
should be in commit logs as well as inline.

And that is true with gcc/binutils work arounds which have been
introduced long time ago.

From my perspective, the kernel always tried to be very user oriented
when it comes to toolchain support: Rather than blacklist a known broken
toolchain version, work arounds have been introduced. And I think we
should treat Clang no different.

That being said, I am not saying we should hack up the kernel to make
Clang work no matter what. There are fixes made in Clang so we can avoid
introducing hacks in the kernel. There needs to be a balance.

Again, I think more important is that when we introduce work arounds in
Linux, that we make sure that such changes are properly document. This
will make cleanup a *lot* easier and therefor more likely down the road.

That is actually a very good point and hasn't really been taken into
account in this discussion.

Currently the default behavior is that iWMMXT is enabled for all CPUs
supporting it. With the patch as-is, users who might try out Clang (with
integrated assembler) likely will not notice that iWMMXT is not
supported. They will be in for a surprise once they try to use user
space applications making use of iWMMXT instructions.

Avoiding such surprises would mean we either disable all iWMMXT
CPUs/architectures when using Clang's integrated assembler or make sure
they work with the integrated assembler.

Is there a nice way to print a warning at build time in this case?

I guess making the macros a Clang only thing should be doable.

So far I at least did not really look into supporting ARMv5
architectures when building with Clang. I would be fine to just disable
ARMv5 architecture when using Clang's integrated assembler, at least for
now.

However, iWMMXT is also supported by Marvell's PJ4 microarchitecture,
which is an ARMv7-A architecture. Hence this file is assembled when
building multi_v7_defconfig (since ARCH_DOVE is enabled there). So if we
consider iWMMXT mandatory to support an architecture, we would have to
disable more than "just" ARMv5.

That said, I still would prefer this patch over disabling all the
architectures. Keep in mind that integrated assembler needs to be
explicitly enabled (using LLVM_IAS=1).

While I fear that the asm macro surgery will not be that clean/trivial,
I still think its the best option. It side steps the problem of
accidentally breaking user space and ultimately allows to build more
configurations with Clang's integrated assembler.
