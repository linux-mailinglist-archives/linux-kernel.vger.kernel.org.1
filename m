Yes, the CPU stopper (i.e. CFS's active load balance) can help here.
IMHO, using the CPU stopper in RT/DL for moving the running task (next
to using best fit rather than just fit CPU) is considered future work.
AFAICS, push/pull is not designed for migration of running tasks.

So far Capacity awareness in RT/DL means that as long as there are CPUs
available which fit the task, use one of them. This is already
beneficial for a lot of use cases on CPU asymmetric systems since it
offers more predictable behavior.

I'll add a note to the cover letter in the next version about the reason
of the rt-app 'delay'.
