Main reason is we want to ensure the MHI controller is zero-initialized 
and
we want to mandate it as it is better to have it under our control in 
case
we also want to allocate and track peripheral data/memory related to the 
MHI
controller.

This one should be dependent on the patch [1] which exists on mainline 
and
should already part of your tree if you're on any 5.10 RC.
