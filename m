A complete correction of the unix name actually becomes SD-X, supply and 
demand OS.

So this is now what it is called, with all things discussed included.

Supply and Demand being a monotheistic principle that decides what 
happens on the OS, like indeed school teaches.
(Rather than "Uni" which seems to be a "hip" version of "god" or something).

Serenity,
Ywe CÃ¦rlyn.
