For older CPUs, it doesn't matter what the latest ARM ARM says, the
appropriate version of the ARM ARM is the one relevant for the CPU
architecture.  This is a mistake frequently made, and it's been pointed
out by Arm Ltd in the past (before ARMv6 even came on the scene) that
keeping older revisions is necessary if you want to be interested in
the older architectures.

However, there's an additional complication here: DEC's license from
Arm Ltd back in the days of StrongARM allowed them to make changes to
the architecture - that was passed over to Intel when they bought that
part of DEC.  Consequently, these "non-Arm vendor" cores contain
extensions that are not part of the ARM ARM.  iWMMXT is one such
example, which first appeared in the Intel PXA270 SoC (an ARMv5
derived CPU).

In fact, several of the features found in later versions of the ARM
architecture came from DEC and Intel enhancements.

If your compiler/assembler only implements what is in the latest ARM
ARM, then it is not going to be suitable for these older CPUs and
alternate vendor "ARM compatible" CPUs.

That gets close to a GPL violation; the GPL requires that source code
be in the preferred form for making modifications. Encoding raw opcodes
can in no way be argued to be the preferred form. Arguing that raw
opcodes is acceptable sets a precedent that makes it acceptable for
other "works" to do the same, which makes arguments against firmware
supplied as a hexdump null and void.

Using macros to emulate the instructions and create the appropriate
opcodes is an alternative; we already have that for some of the VFP
code as early toolchains had no support for the VFP instructions.

So no, bare opcodes are unacceptable.
