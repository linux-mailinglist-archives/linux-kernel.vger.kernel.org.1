Let me make a more precise statement and tell me if you agree. The "no
eligible task" is concerning for the charging path but not for the
writer of memory.max. The writer can read the usage and
cgroup.[procs|events] to figure out the situation if needed. Usually
such writers (i.e. resource managers) use memory.high in addition to
memory.max. First set memory.high and once the usage is below the high
then set max to not induce the oom-kills.
