Subject: Bought Samsung Galaxy S20+ at ZERO DOLLAR on 2nd July 2020 
Thursday

Mr. Turritopsis Dohrnii Teo En Ming (Singaporean Targeted Individual) 
bought a Samsung Galaxy S20+ at ZERO DOLLAR on 2nd July 2020 Thursday. 
It is an Android 10 smartphone. Android is based on Linux. The Linux 
Kernel version of my Samsung Galaxy S20+ is 4.19.87-18598659 #1 Thu May 
14 17:43:28 KST 2020.

Mr. Turritopsis Dohrnii Teo En Ming (Singaporean Targeted Individual) is 
a Linux supporter and enthusiast.

Color: Cloud Blue
RAM: 8 GB
Internal Storage: 128 GB, expandable to 1 TB using microSD card

Date bought: 2nd July 2020 Thursday
Time bought: 7 pm to 8 pm Singapore Time GMT+8
Place bought: Singtel shop, Bugis Junction, Singapore, Singapore
Price: ZERO DOLLAR

Signed 2-year mobile contract with Singtel. The 2-year mobile contract 
will expire on 1st July 2022.

Mobile plan: Singtel Combo 3
Add-on: Data X Infinity (Unlimited mobile data)

SMS, Unlimited mobile data

The biggest selling point of Samsung Galaxy S20+ is its ability to take 
8K (7680x4320) videos. 1 minute of 8K video will take up 600 MB of 
storage space. There is a limitation on the maximum duration of 8K 
videos you can take on the Samsung Galaxy S20+. It is capped at 5 mins. 
5 mins of 8K video will take up 5 x 600 = 3000 MB or 3 GB of storage 
space.

Mr. Turritopsis Dohrnii Teo En Ming (Singaporean Targeted Individual) is 
very excited about being able to take 8K videos and is one of the very 
few in the world to do so.
