capitalize acronyms, please:                             NUMA

Now I'm confused.  5 lines above here it says "All memory amounts are in bytes"
but these appear to be in pages. Which is it?  and what size pages if that matters?

Is it like this?
	  type N0=<bytes in node 0 pages> N1=<bytes in node 1 pages> ...

Some of the descriptions above end with a '.' and some do not. Please be consistent.
