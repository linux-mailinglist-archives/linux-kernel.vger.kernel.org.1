OK, got it, and thank you for the explanation.

Well, there really is a bug.  Yes, right now all ->sync pointers are
non-NULL, but they have not been in the past and might not be in the
future.  So if ->sync is NULL, rcu_torture_fwd_prog_nr() either should
not be called or it should return immediately without doing anything.

My current thought is something like the (untested) patch below, of
course with your Reported-by.

Thoughts?
