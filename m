This is caused by c03584e30534 ("mm: memmap_init: iterate over memblock
regions rather that check each PFN"). The commit sha is valid for
v5.7-rc6-mmots-2020-05-19-21-52, so it will change in a day or so :)

As it seems, sparc32 never registered the memory occupied by the kernel
image with memblock_add() and it only reserves this memory with
meblock_reserve(). 

I don't know what would happen on real HW, but with 

qemu-system-sparc -kernel /path/to/kernel

the memory occupied by the kernel is reserved in openbios and removed
from mem.available. The prom setup code in the kernel used mem.available
to set up the memory banks and essentially there is a hole for the
memory occupied by the kernel.

Later in bootmem_init() this memory is memblock_reserve()d.

Before the problematic commit, memmap initialization would call
__init_single_page() for the pages in that hole, the
free_low_memory_core_early() would mark them as resrved and everything
would be Ok.

After the change in memmap initialization, the hole is skipped and the
page structs for it are not inited. And when they are passed from
memblock to page allocator as reserved it gets confused.

Simply registering the memory occupied by the kernel with memblock_add()
resolves this issue, at least for qemu-system-arm and I cannot see how
it can harm any other setup.

If all that makes sense I'll send a proper patch :)
