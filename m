Yes. Please see perf_event_create_kernel_event(), which is
an exported function allowing any kernel code (including modules)
to use the PMU (just like the userspace perf tool would do).
Just because your use case doesn't trigger this (because
you don't run something that can trigger this) doesn't mean
this can't be triggered.
