Ah, OK!  Could that be added to the commit message?

Also, shouldn't you mark kgdb_arch_set_breakpoint()?  What about
dbg_activate_sw_breakpoints()?  I haven't gone and extensively
searched, but those two jump out to me as ones that were missed.

I suppose that means that if someone tried to set a breakpoint on a
kgdb function that wasn't one of the ones that you listed then the
system would happily report that the breakpoint has been set (no error
given) but that the breakpoint would just have no effect?  It wouldn't
crash (which is good), it just wouldn't detect that the breakpoint was
useless.  However, if these were in the NOKPROBE_SYMBOL then you'd get
a nice error message.  Is there no way we could use a linker script to
just mark everything using a linker script or somesuch?
