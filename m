Icelake has the same capabilities against software attacks as
generations before that given the same CPU access control.

A custom interposer on a bus could use replay for the data coming out of
the CPU package. In pre-Icelake (i.e. MEE), this is prevented with a
Merkle tree.

However, DMA is still blocked by the PRMRR to the EPC memory even on
Icelake (SDM section 41.10), which adds some cost to do so (e.g. a
malicous peripheral).

Memory is of course encrypted in both architectures.

Agreed that the current paragraph looks confusing. I'll refine it based
on what I just wrote. I want to make it as transparent as possible but
it cannot be achieved without appropriate feedback.

Executing in a process context.

Thanks, I'll fix that one.

Sorry for the late response. I came last week back from vacation and
have been purging the piled up stacks of email (looking at your domain
I have to add that I was in Brno, Czech).
