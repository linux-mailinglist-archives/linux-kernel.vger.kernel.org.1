It would be a bit complicated.  Definitely after any signals from the
syscall are delivered.  Right now, I think that we don't deliver a
SIGTRAP on the instruction boundary after SYSCALL while
single-stepping.  (I think we used to, but only sometimes, and now we
are at least consistent.)  This is because IRET will not trap if it
starts with TF clear and ends up setting it.  (I asked Intel to
document this, and I think they finally did, although I haven't gotten
around to reading the new docs.  Certainly the old docs as of a year
or two ago had no description whatsoever of how TF changes worked.)

Deciding exactly *when* a trap should occur would be nontrivial -- we
can't trap on sigreturn() from a SIGTRAP, for example.

So this isn't fully worked out.

You're assuming that figuring out the cause doesn't need the kernel
entry code to run first.  In the case of the 32-bit vDSO fast
syscalls, we arguably don't know whether an entry is a syscall until
we have done a user memory access.  Logically, we're doing:

if (get_user() < 0) {
  /* Not a syscall.  This is actually a silly operation that sets AX =
-EFAULT and returns.  Do not audit or invoke ptrace. */
} else {
  /* This actually is a syscall. */
}

So we really do want to stick arch code between the
enter_from_user_mode() and the audit check.  We *can't* audit because
we don't know the syscall args.  Now maybe we could invent new
semantics for this in which a fault here is still somehow a syscall,
but I think that would be a real ABI change and would want very
careful thought.  And it would be weird -- syscalls are supposed to
actually call the syscall handler, aren't they?  (Arguably we should
go back in time and make this a SIGSEGV.  We have the infrastructure
to do this cleanly, but when I wrote the code I just copied the ABI
from code that was before my time.  Even so, it would be an exception,
not a syscall.)

Why do we want to distinguish between exception and syscall
entry/exit?  For the enter part, AFAICS the exception case boils down
to enter_from_user_mode() and the syscall case is:

        enter_from_user_mode(regs);
        instrumentation_begin();

        local_irq_enable();
        ti_work = READ_ONCE(current_thread_info()->flags);
        if (ti_work & SYSCALL_ENTER_WORK)
                syscall = syscall_trace_enter(regs, syscall, ti_work);
        instrumentation_end();

Which would decompose quite nicely as a regular (non-syscall) entry
plus the syscall part later.

This is why I still like my:

arch_c_entry()
  irqentry_enter_from_user_mode();
  generic_syscall();
  exit...
}
