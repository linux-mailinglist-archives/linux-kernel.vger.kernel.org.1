I'm also starting to think this isn't even possible or currently doable
safely.
The fdtable in the kernel would end up with a dangling pointer, I would
think. Unless you backtrack all fds that still have a reference into the
fdtable and refer to that file and close them all in the kernel which I
don't think is possible and also sounds very dodgy. This also really
seems like we would be breaking a major contract, namely that fds stay
valid until userspace calls close, execve(), or exits.
