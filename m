to fix this.

I believe we are PTRACE_GETREGSing and later PTRACE_SETREGSing, but
doing the latter with garbage for fs/gs_base for a 32 bit tracee. That
didn't used to matter (because those values were completely ignored
for a 32 bit tracee) but now it does.

There's a good case that that's our fault and I'm happy to spend my
"don't break userspace" points somewhere else ;)
