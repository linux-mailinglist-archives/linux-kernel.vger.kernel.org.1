I'm not too convinced about this. While I'm not able to produce a
reference from a quick view either into ieee1275 and DTSpec, I believe
the DT describes the hardware from software's perspective.

That is, there's no point in describing hardware implementation details
that have no bearing on software interface (such as a single
software-controlled clock being routed to different parts of a chip).

Adding Rob to Cc, he will likely be able to clarify.
