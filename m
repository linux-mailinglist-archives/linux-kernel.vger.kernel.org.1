OK more thoughts and few points I missed earlier. The SoC infrastructure
is more wider than the SoC itself IMO. The machine and serial_number
are beyond the SoC and this SMCCC SOC_ID confined itself to SoC for
simple reason that it is part of SoC vendor firmware which could be
used across various machines/boards/platforms.

I wonder now that rather than adding this as a SoC sysfs driver on it's
own, does it make sense to keep it as library which existing drivers
can use. Or we need to standardise the machine level interface that may
like outside SoC firmware and use both to have a generic SoC sysfs driver.

Sorry, I am just writing as I am thinking and may be talking garbage.
