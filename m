Okay, i updated in v17.

Sure, Added in v17 to mention display RSC.

It can, but it will require changing multiple places to make it const. 
some of those functions are

dropped/modified in doug's cleanup series. I can do in separate patch 
once this series is pulled in.

Ok, added in v17.

Okay. AddedÂ  lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled(). But this may need to be 
dropped when

we add support for display RSC.
