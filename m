The host does not consume the manifest directly -- instead, the bootloader
will use the manifest to populate these DT nodes. Again, these are *only*
for non-secure virtual partitions which are to be managed by KVM.

Make what discoverable?

The host is trusted during early boot, and gives up this trust after
initialising EL2 fully. So roughly speaking, we:

	* Boot at EL2 and install a shim
	* Drop down to EL2 and start the host kernel
	* Before some initialisation (DT parsing, SMP bringup, etc)
	* Init KVM by calling back up to EL2 to install the full hypervisor

At that point, the EL1 host is no longer trusted and the last call
effectively "locks it out" from EL2.

Right, but the format of the manifest isn't defined by the spec so I really
don't think it's something that Linux should be dealing with directly.
