So in Arm SMMU analogy terms it's more like a context bank index than a 
stream ID - got it.

Aha, indeed that iommu-map-mask is the trick :)

Yes, the "iommus" property will mean that the group always gets created 
first for the platform device owning the host bridge, and thus won't be 
visible to pci_device_group() anyway. Subsequent tegra_smmu_group_get() 
calls for the PCI devices (including the PCI side of the host bridge 
itself) are then going to match TEGRA_SWGROUP_AFI in the smmu->groups 
list lookup and return early, so the dev_is_pci() condition will never 
be true, and the call to pci_device_group() is in fact entirely dead code.

(I was assuming a case where you didn't have the "iommus" property, in 
which case you would reach that path exactly once for the first PCI 
device probed, wherein pci_device_group() is still only going to fall 
through to calling iommu_group_alloc() anyway).

Cheers,
Robin.
