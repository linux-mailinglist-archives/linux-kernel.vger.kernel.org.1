This commit contains the changes required to re-layout the kernel text
sections generated by -ffunction-sections shortly after decompression.
Documentation of the feature is also added.

After decompression, the decompressed image's elf headers are parsed.
In order to manually update certain data structures that are built with
relative offsets during the kernel build process, certain symbols are
not stripped by objdump and their location is retained in the elf symbol
tables. These addresses are saved.

If the image was built with -ffunction-sections, there will be ELF section
headers present which contain information about the address range of each
section. Anything that is not broken out into function sections (i.e. is
consolidated into .text) is left in it's original location, but any other
executable section which begins with ".text." is located and shuffled
randomly within the remaining text segment address range.

After the sections have been copied to their new locations, but before
relocations have been applied, the kallsyms tables must be updated to
reflect the new symbol locations. Because it is expected that these tables
will be sorted by address, the kallsyms tables will need to be sorted
after the update.

When applying relocations, the address of the relocation needs to be
adjusted by the offset from the original location of the section that was
randomized to it's new location. In addition, if a value at that relocation
was a location in the text segment that was randomized, it's value will be
adjusted to a new location.

After relocations have been applied, the exception table must be updated
with with new symbol locations, and then re-sorted by the new address. The
orc table will have been updated as part of applying relocations, but since
it is expected to be sorted by address, it will need to be resorted.

+=====================================================================
+Function Granular Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (fgkaslr)
+=====================================================================
+
+:Date: 6 April 2020
+:Author: Kristen Accardi
+
+Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) was merged into the kernel
+with the objective of increasing the difficulty of code reuse attacks. Code
+reuse attacks reused existing code snippets to get around existing memory
+protections. They exploit software bugs which expose addresses of useful code
+snippets to control the flow of execution for their own nefarious purposes.
+KASLR as it was originally implemented moves the entire kernel code text as a
+unit at boot time in order to make addresses less predictable. The order of the
+code within the segment is unchanged - only the base address is shifted. There
+are a few shortcomings to this algorithm.
+
+1. Low Entropy - there are only so many locations the kernel can fit in. This
+   means an attacker could guess without too much trouble.
+2. Knowledge of a single address can reveal the offset of the base address,
+   exposing all other locations for a published/known kernel image.
+3. Info leaks abound.
+
+Finer grained ASLR has been proposed as a way to make ASLR more resistant
+to info leaks. It is not a new concept at all, and there are many variations
+possible. Function reordering is an implementation of finer grained ASLR
+which randomizes the layout of an address space on a function level
+granularity. The term "fgkaslr" is used in this document to refer to the
+technique of function reordering when used with KASLR, as well as finer grained
+KASLR in general.
+
+The objective of this patch set is to improve a technology that is already
+merged into the kernel (KASLR). This code will not prevent all code reuse
+attacks, and should be considered as one of several tools that can be used.
+
+Implementation Details
+======================
+
+The over-arching objective of the fgkaslr implementation is incremental
+improvement over the existing KASLR algorithm. It is designed to work with
+the existing solution, and there are two main area where code changes occur:
+Build time, and Load time.
+
+Build time
+----------
+
+GCC has had an option to place functions into individual .text sections
+for many years now (-ffunction-sections). This option is used to implement
+function reordering at load time. The final compiled vmlinux retains all the
+section headers, which can be used to help find the address ranges of each
+function. Using this information and an expanded table of relocation addresses,
+individual text sections can be shuffled immediately after decompression.
+Some data tables inside the kernel that have assumptions about order
+require sorting after the update. In order to modify these tables,
+a few key symbols from the objcopy symbol stripping process are preserved
+for use after shuffling the text segments. Any special input sections which are
+defined by the kernel build process and collected into the .text output
+segment are left unmodified and will still be present inside the .text segment,
+unrandomized other than normal base address randomization.
+
+Load time
+---------
+
+The boot kernel was modified to parse the vmlinux elf file after
+decompression to check for symbols for modifying data tables, and to
+look for any .text.* sections to randomize. The sections are then shuffled,
+and tables are updated or resorted. The existing code which updated relocation
+addresses was modified to account for not just a fixed delta from the load
+address, but the offset that the function section was moved to. This requires
+inspection of each address to see if it was impacted by a randomization.
+
+In order to hide the new layout, symbols reported through /proc/kallsyms will
+be sorted by name alphabetically rather than by address.
+
+Performance Impact
+==================
+
+There are two areas where function reordering can impact performance: boot
+time latency, and run time performance.
+
+Boot time latency
+-----------------
+
+This implementation of finer grained KASLR impacts the boot time of the kernel
+in several places. It requires additional parsing of the kernel ELF file to
+obtain the section headers of the sections to be randomized. It calls the
+random number generator for each section to be randomized to determine that
+section's new memory location. It copies the decompressed kernel into a new
+area of memory to avoid corruption when laying out the newly randomized
+sections. It increases the number of relocations the kernel has to perform at
+boot time vs. standard KASLR, and it also requires a lookup on each address
+that needs to be relocated to see if it was in a randomized section and needs
+to be adjusted by a new offset. Finally, it re-sorts a few data tables that
+are required to be sorted by address.
+
+Booting a test VM on a modern, well appointed system showed an increase in
+latency of approximately 1 second.
+
+Run time
+--------
+
+The performance impact at run-time of function reordering varies by workload.
+Randomly reordering the functions will cause an increase in cache misses
+for some workloads. Some workloads perform significantly worse under FGKASLR,
+while others stay the same or even improve. In general, it will depend on the
+code flow whether or not finer grained KASLR will impact a workload, and how
+the underlying code was designed. Because the layout changes per boot, each
+time a system is rebooted the performance of a workload may change.
+
+Image Size
+==========
+
+fgkaslr increases the size of the kernel binary due to the extra section
+headers that are included, as well as the extra relocations that need to
+be added. You can expect fgkaslr to increase the size of the resulting
+vmlinux by about 3%, and the compressed image (bzImage) by 15%.
+
+Memory Usage
+============
+
+fgkaslr increases the amount of heap that is required at boot time,
+although this extra memory is released when the kernel has finished
+decompression. As a result, it may not be appropriate to use this feature
+on systems without much memory.
+
+Building
+========
+
+To enable fine grained KASLR, you need to have the following config options
+set (including all the ones you would use to build normal KASLR)
+
+``CONFIG_FG_KASLR=y``
+
+fgkaslr for the kernel is only supported for the X86_64 architecture.
+
+Modules
+=======
+
+Modules are randomized similarly to the rest of the kernel by shuffling
+the sections at load time prior to moving them into memory. The module must
+also have been build with the -ffunction-sections compiler option.
+
+Although fgkaslr for the kernel is only supported for the X86_64 architecture,
+it is possible to use fgkaslr with modules on other architectures. To enable
+this feature, select the following config option:
+
+``CONFIG_MODULE_FG_KASLR``
+
+This option is selected automatically for X86_64 when CONFIG_FG_KASLR is set.
+
+Disabling
+=========
+
+Disabling normal kaslr using the nokaslr command line option also disables
+fgkaslr. In addtion, it is possible to disable fgkaslr separately by booting
+with fgkaslr=off on the commandline.
+
+Further Information
+===================
+
+There are a lot of academic papers which explore finer grained ASLR.
+This paper in particular contributed significantly to the implementation design.
