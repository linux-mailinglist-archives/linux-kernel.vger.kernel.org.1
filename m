OK.

No, for indicating if the remoteproc is 32-bit or 64-bit and adjust the 
loading handlers if the resource types need to be segregated accordingly.

Yeah, definitely a draw-back if we want to support big-endian rprocs. Do 
you have any remoteprocs following big-endian? All TI remoteprocs are 
little-endian except for really old ones.
