The origin motivation is for debugging purpose during daily work,
I was trying to evaluate the load balance behavior on some specific
platforms.
Another motivation was inspired by a previous lkp performance regression
report that, after the rework of load balance, some workloads might get
performance downgrading. And it is suspected that the system after the
rework is more likely to spread tasks onto more CPUs, which brings more
idle time -> and deeper cstate -> lower performance. So in order to
evaluate which flag might help mitigate the spreading(disable PREFER_SIBLING?),
it might be an applicable option to make the flags writable, so lkp could
launch the workload with different flags settings so we can gather more clues.
But yes, I'm ok if the flags are kept read-only, and we can hack into
the code temporarily to turn it into writable for debugging.

thx,
Chenyu
