If you were using it for DP, you would need a DT node for the DP
connector (with bindings to be added to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/connector/, similar to the
ones we already have for other connectors). That DT node should
reference the HPD pin GPIO. The bridge driver for the connector
(drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/display-connector.c) would then handle HPD. The
good news is that it already does :-)

Bridge drivers should only implement support for features available from
the corresponding hardware. If an HPD signal is connected to a dedicated
pin of the bridge, and the bridge can generate an interrupt and expose
the HPD status through I2C, then it should implement HPD-related
operations. If the HPD pin from the connector is hooked up to a GPIO of
the SoC, it should be handled by the connector bridge driver.
