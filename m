Hi Boris,

Thanks for your help.

I was thinking about the bindings and I think that the bindings below 
are close to what has been done for Atmel EBI/Raw NAND bindings (in 
terms of structure of bindings if I have well understood).
I think that these proposed bindings are very close to the first 
proposed version (V1/V2).
