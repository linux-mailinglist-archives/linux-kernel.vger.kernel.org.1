+SPU_CREATE(2)              Linux Programmer's Manual             SPU_CREATE(2)
+
+
+
+NAME
+       spu_create - create a new spu context
+
+
+SYNOPSIS
+       #include <sys/types.h>
+       #include <sys/spu.h>
+
+       int spu_create(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
+
+DESCRIPTION
+       The  spu_create  system call is used on PowerPC machines that implement
+       the Cell Broadband Engine Architecture in order to  access  Synergistic
+       Processor  Units (SPUs). It creates a new logical context for an SPU in
+       pathname and returns a handle to associated  with  it.   pathname  must
+       point  to  a  non-existing directory in the mount point of the SPU file
+       system (spufs).  When spu_create is successful, a directory  gets  cre-
+       ated on pathname and it is populated with files.
+
+       The  returned  file  handle can only be passed to spu_run(2) or closed,
+       other operations are not defined on it. When it is closed, all  associ-
+       ated  directory entries in spufs are removed. When the last file handle
+       pointing either inside  of  the  context  directory  or  to  this  file
+       descriptor is closed, the logical SPU context is destroyed.
+
+       The  parameter flags can be zero or any bitwise or'd combination of the
+       following constants:
+
+       SPU_RAWIO
+              Allow mapping of some of the hardware registers of the SPU  into
+              user space. This flag requires the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability, see
+              capabilities(7).
+
+       The mode parameter specifies the permissions used for creating the  new
+       directory  in  spufs.   mode is modified with the user's umask(2) value
+       and then used for both the directory and the files contained in it. The
+       file permissions mask out some more bits of mode because they typically
+       support only read or write access. See stat(2) for a full list  of  the
+       possible mode values.
+
+
+RETURN VALUE
+       spu_create  returns a new file descriptor. It may return -1 to indicate
+       an error condition and set errno to  one  of  the  error  codes  listed
+       below.
+
+
+ERRORS
+       EACCES
+              The  current  user does not have write access on the spufs mount
+              point.
+
+       EEXIST An SPU context already exists at the given path name.
+
+       EFAULT pathname is not a valid string pointer in  the  current  address
+              space.
+
+       EINVAL pathname is not a directory in the spufs mount point.
+
+       ELOOP  Too many symlinks were found while resolving pathname.
+
+       EMFILE The process has reached its maximum open file limit.
+
+       ENAMETOOLONG
+              pathname was too long.
+
+       ENFILE The system has reached the global open file limit.
+
+       ENOENT Part of pathname could not be resolved.
+
+       ENOMEM The kernel could not allocate all resources required.
+
+       ENOSPC There  are  not  enough  SPU resources available to create a new
+              context or the user specific limit for the number  of  SPU  con-
+              texts has been reached.
+
+       ENOSYS the functionality is not provided by the current system, because
+              either the hardware does not provide SPUs or the spufs module is
+              not loaded.
+
+       ENOTDIR
+              A part of pathname is not a directory.
+
+
+
+NOTES
+       spu_create  is  meant  to  be used from libraries that implement a more
+       abstract interface to SPUs, not to be used from  regular  applications.
+       See  http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/ for the rec-
+       ommended libraries.
+
+
+FILES
+       pathname must point to a location beneath the mount point of spufs.  By
+       convention, it gets mounted in /spu.
+
+
+CONFORMING TO
+       This call is Linux specific and only implemented by the ppc64 architec-
+       ture. Programs using this system call are not portable.

+SPU_RUN(2)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                SPU_RUN(2)
+
+
+
+NAME
+       spu_run - execute an spu context
+
+
+SYNOPSIS
+       #include <sys/spu.h>
+
+       int spu_run(int fd, unsigned int *npc, unsigned int *event);
+
+DESCRIPTION
+       The  spu_run system call is used on PowerPC machines that implement the
+       Cell Broadband Engine Architecture in order to access Synergistic  Pro-
+       cessor  Units  (SPUs).  It  uses the fd that was returned from spu_cre-
+       ate(2) to address a specific SPU context. When the context gets  sched-
+       uled  to a physical SPU, it starts execution at the instruction pointer
+       passed in npc.
+
+       Execution of SPU code happens synchronously, meaning that spu_run  does
+       not  return  while the SPU is still running. If there is a need to exe-
+       cute SPU code in parallel with other code on either  the  main  CPU  or
+       other  SPUs,  you  need to create a new thread of execution first, e.g.
+       using the pthread_create(3) call.
+
+       When spu_run returns, the current value of the SPU instruction  pointer
+       is  written back to npc, so you can call spu_run again without updating
+       the pointers.
+
+       event can be a NULL pointer or point to an extended  status  code  that
+       gets  filled  when spu_run returns. It can be one of the following con-
+       stants:
+
+       SPE_EVENT_DMA_ALIGNMENT
+              A DMA alignment error
+
+       SPE_EVENT_SPE_DATA_SEGMENT
+              A DMA segmentation error
+
+       SPE_EVENT_SPE_DATA_STORAGE
+              A DMA storage error
+
+       If NULL is passed as the event argument, these errors will result in  a
+       signal delivered to the calling process.
+
+RETURN VALUE
+       spu_run  returns the value of the spu_status register or -1 to indicate
+       an error and set errno to one of the error  codes  listed  below.   The
+       spu_status  register  value  contains  a  bit  mask of status codes and
+       optionally a 14 bit code returned from the stop-and-signal  instruction
+       on the SPU. The bit masks for the status codes are:
+
+       0x02   SPU was stopped by stop-and-signal.
+
+       0x04   SPU was stopped by halt.
+
+       0x08   SPU is waiting for a channel.
+
+       0x10   SPU is in single-step mode.
+
+       0x20   SPU has tried to execute an invalid instruction.
+
+       0x40   SPU has tried to access an invalid channel.
+
+       0x3fff0000
+              The  bits  masked with this value contain the code returned from
+              stop-and-signal.
+
+       There are always one or more of the lower eight bits set  or  an  error
+       code is returned from spu_run.
+
+ERRORS
+       EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
+              fd is in non-blocking mode and spu_run would block.
+
+       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.
+
+       EFAULT npc is not a valid pointer or status is neither NULL nor a valid
+              pointer.
+
+       EINTR  A signal occurred while spu_run was in progress.  The npc  value
+              has  been updated to the new program counter value if necessary.
+
+       EINVAL fd is not a file descriptor returned from spu_create(2).
+
+       ENOMEM Insufficient memory was available to handle a page fault result-
+              ing from an MFC direct memory access.

-       The  spu_create  system call is used on PowerPC machines that implement
-       the Cell Broadband Engine Architecture in order to  access  Synergistic
-       Processor  Units (SPUs). It creates a new logical context for an SPU in

-       ated on pathname and it is populated with files.
-
-       The  returned  file  handle can only be passed to spu_run(2) or closed,
-       other operations are not defined on it. When it is closed, all  associ-
-       ated  directory entries in spufs are removed. When the last file handle
-       pointing either inside  of  the  context  directory  or  to  this  file
-       descriptor is closed, the logical SPU context is destroyed.
-

-       directory  in  spufs.   mode is modified with the user's umask(2) value
-       and then used for both the directory and the files contained in it. The
-       file permissions mask out some more bits of mode because they typically
-       support only read or write access. See stat(2) for a full list  of  the
-       possible mode values.

-
-RETURN VALUE
-       spu_create  returns a new file descriptor. It may return -1 to indicate
-       an error condition and set errno to  one  of  the  error  codes  listed
-       below.

-
-ERRORS
-       EACCES
-              The  current  user does not have write access on the spufs mount
-              point.
-
-       EEXIST An SPU context already exists at the given path name.
-
-       EFAULT pathname is not a valid string pointer in  the  current  address
-              space.
-
-       EINVAL pathname is not a directory in the spufs mount point.
-
-       ELOOP  Too many symlinks were found while resolving pathname.
-
-       EMFILE The process has reached its maximum open file limit.
-
-       ENAMETOOLONG
-              pathname was too long.
-
-       ENFILE The system has reached the global open file limit.
-
-       ENOENT Part of pathname could not be resolved.
-
-       ENOMEM The kernel could not allocate all resources required.
-
-       ENOSPC There  are  not  enough  SPU resources available to create a new
-              context or the user specific limit for the number  of  SPU  con-
-              texts has been reached.
-
-       ENOSYS the functionality is not provided by the current system, because
-              either the hardware does not provide SPUs or the spufs module is
-              not loaded.
-
-       ENOTDIR
-              A part of pathname is not a directory.

-NOTES
-       spu_create  is  meant  to  be used from libraries that implement a more
-       abstract interface to SPUs, not to be used from  regular  applications.
-       See  http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/ for the rec-
-       ommended libraries.
-
-
-FILES
-       pathname must point to a location beneath the mount point of spufs.  By
-       convention, it gets mounted in /spu.
