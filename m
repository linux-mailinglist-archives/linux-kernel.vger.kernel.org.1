Hi,

Seems that we have different hardware, so the first question is
first the most interesting thing: how much does the hw actually differ,
especially do they require different device trees?

Can you provide me a photo of your hardware?
Or is it a Shine 3?

Mine is at https://misc.andi.de1.cc/tolino2.jpg

Just for the readers with IMX knowledge but without knowledge of the
vendor kernel hacks used here: That block is on a hidden partition of
the boot medium (uSD or eMMC) describing the hardware, the kernel gets
it from the bootloader and it is used e.g. in the board file.

correct. It uses the brcmfmac driver on mainline and the .
bcmdhd in the vendor kernel

as long as these chips do not use oob interrupts, just sdio,
it should be no problem. The question is just how much our devices
differ.
