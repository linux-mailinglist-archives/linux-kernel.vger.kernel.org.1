Just as a note: One effect of that will be that if a process goes into
execve on a setuid binary, but bails out before the point of no
return, a tracer may fail to attach to it during that time window. But
that should be completely fine.

Right, we should be able to do that stuff quite a bit later than it happens now.

At the moment the final security_bprm_set_creds() seems to happen
before we're calling would_dump(), which computes some of the data
we'll need for access checks... I guess we'll have to split up
security_bprm_set_creds into one hook for "here's another executable
file that's part of the execve chain" and a second hook
("security_bprm_cred_sync()"?) for "now the ->unsafe flags are ready
and we're about to drop the lock again, time to modify the creds if
you want to do that". And then LSMs can make decisions that are
influenced by ->unsafe (fiddling with the creds or rejecting the
execution - I think e.g. selinux_bprm_set_creds() can do both) inside
the "cred sync point".

Yeah, seccomp should be able to reject any thread sync if the "next
cred" pointer is set on any of the threads. It should work well as
long as the lock around the "next cred" pointer is at least on the
level of the signal_struct (or broader), so that TSYNC can decide
whether everything's good before starting to iterate over the threads.
