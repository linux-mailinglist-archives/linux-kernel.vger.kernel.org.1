True.

This is true. We could do this if wanted. Most of the time bad source
address would require either badly behaving run-time or doing it on
purpose. For the former case, since it is badly behaving by definition,
this granularity would not improve situation. For the latter case, we do
not want to do any active support.

I guess I'll still have to correct the documentation just a bit.

I don't think we care about that unless it renders out any legit
correctly working feature for a run-time.
