An interesting observation I want to share with interested, is a problem 
in democratic politics where politics end up in a vain cycle due to the 
peoples interests but lack of knowledge.

Brexit seems to be such a thing, where supposedly people want to return 
to a nations values, that is monarchic, that again in Englands case is 
Bal, that again is the Bibles God, again Tor turned cider, and Jesus 
water to wine scenarios.

In old mesopotamia it is a similar scenario called The Bal Cycle, where 
kings cycle according to the definitions of their gods.

If we rather focus on a supply and demand principles, which is 
monotheistic, we break this cycle.

And then we also gain the adamic background on fair pay.

Serenity,
Ywe Cærlyn.
