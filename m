Yes, in principle everything seccomp does could have been done with
ptrace but the whole point was not to use ptrace as a primitive to
build hacks upon. So this is not a good solution.

Using LD_PRELOAD for security infrastructure is a really bad idea
anyway. There are nearly unboundedly many ways code could end up
executing before the preloaded ctors. Preinit arrays, malformed ELF
headers seizing control of execution of ldso, etc. The seccomp filters
really need to be in place *before* the untrusted code runs.

I would assume you use SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF to implement policy for
controlling these operations and allowing only the ones that are valid
during dynamic linking. This also allows you to defer application of
the filter until after execve. So unless I'm missing some reason why
this doesn't work, I think the requested functionality is already
available.

If you really just want the "activate at exec" behavior, it might be
possible (depending on how SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF behaves when there's
no notify fd open; I forget) to setup the filter so that the "mode
switch" happens automatically at exec by having the notify fd being
close-on-exec (notifications handled by a thread before exec). If this
works it would avoid having an extra process involved and managing its
lifetime.

I don't think this can be made into a safe security boundary.

This distinction is probably over-rated. Certainly there's a lot of
software (see the example of systemd) that's on a spectrum between
"actively malicious" and "actively doing things that the developers
don't intend or perceive as malicious but that the user does, and that
would be harmful to their system if allowed to execute outside of the
sandbox". This also applies to things like games with invasive/spyware
anti-cheat features, proprietary software with license manager
interactions, etc.
