FWIW, I think we have two pretty fundamental issues:

  1) The E820 map isn't a very good match for the Linux resource
  manager because Linux assumes resources can't overlap unless they're
  strictly hierarchical.  The E820 and EFI memory maps make no such
  assumption.

  2) We only look at ACPI _CRS information on an ad hoc basis, so we
  ignore most of the detailed address space information from firmware.
