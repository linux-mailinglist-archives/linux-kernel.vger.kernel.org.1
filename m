The purpose of signed dm-verity images is to authenticate files, or said
in another way, to enable the kernel to trust disk images in a flexible
way (i.e. thanks to certificate's chain of trust). Being able to update
such chain at run time requires to use the second trusted keyring. This
keyring automatically includes the certificate authorities from the
builtin trusted keyring, which are required to dynamically populate the
secondary trusted keyring with certificates signed by an already trusted
authority. The roots of trust must then be included at build time in the
builtin trusted keyring.

To be meaningful, using dm-verity signatures implies to have a
restricted user space, i.e. even the root user has limited power over
the kernel and the rest of the system. Blindly trusting data provided by
user space (e.g. dm-verity table argument, kernel module parameter)
defeat the purpose of (mandatory) authenticated images.

That is already the current state (on purpose).

Moreover, a Kconfig knob makes sense as much as
DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG,
IMA_KEYRINGS_PERMIT_SIGNED_BY_BUILTIN_OR_SECONDARY, MODULE_SIG_FORCE and
other similar authentication mechanisms. Indeed, when using these
configurations, we want the kernel to enforce a specific policy.

Obviously, we can't make the DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG relies on the
secondary trusted keyring without important security implications for
systems already using this configuration (and then the builtin trusted
keyring as the unique source of trust).
