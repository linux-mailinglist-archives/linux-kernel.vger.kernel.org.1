I don't think the kernel can do much better than what you're seeing. I don't
know the time scale that you need - is it some tens of microseconds range? I'm
definitely not an expert on the subject but on generic kernels I don't think
you can achieve anything sub millisec with any kind of reliability.

If the timing is that tight and it's not a hot path, the right solution may be
polling for it rather than yielding the cpu and hoping to get scheduled in
time.

Just glanced over it and I still wonder whether it needs to be that tightly
integrated, but we can look into that once we settle on whether this is the
right direction.

Thanks.
