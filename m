I believe the "clock" that is being used here is actually a software
message to the power manager hardware that the debug subsystem isn't
being used anymore. When nothing is requesting that it be enabled the
power manager turns off the power to the debug subsystem and then the
register context is lost. It shouldn't be a clock in the clk subsystem.
It should be a power domain and be attached to the amba devices in the
usual ways. Then the normal runtime PM semantics would follow. If amba
devices require a clk then we'll have to provide a dummy one that
doesn't do anything on this platform.

>=20

Ideally the drivers can have enough knowledge about this situation to do
the proper save/restore steps so that if the coresight hardware isn't
being used we don't keep it powered forever and so that across system
wide suspend/resume we can properly power it off.
