Even without preempt a scheduler is somewhat useful, if you have a
very spammy client. Of course it assumes that everyone submits
reasonably short workloads, otherwise nothing you can do.

Ok so I think it's all good, no misunderstanding, but the commit
message. I think if you delete the first sentence that cross-device
sync must use explicit fences then it all makes sense and is
consistent. Or clarify it that this is cross-engine sync with explicit
internal synchronization, to differentiate it against cross-device
sync (as seen by userspace, like different drm_device instances) and
explicit dma_fence synchronization controlled by userspace.
