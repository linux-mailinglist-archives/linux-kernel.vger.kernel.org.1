Or the other option is to strictly support only one version - the lowest
version supported by the system, which is compatible with all the
others. This could be achieved by using the sanitised feature value of
the SPE version.

Will,

What do you prefer ?

I think the driver assumes that the system supports uniform version
of the SPE (which was valid when the driver was written).
