While this approach of enabling system cache globally for both page 
tables and other buffers
works for the GPU usecase, this isn't ideal for other clients that use 
system cache. For example,
video clients only want to cache a subset of their buffers in the system 
cache, due to the sizing constraint
imposed by how much of the system cache they can use. So, it would be 
ideal to have
a way of expressing the desire to use the system cache on a per-buffer 
basis. Additionally,
our video clients use the DMA layer, and since the requirement is for 
caching in the system cache
to be a per buffer attribute, it seems like we would have to have a DMA 
attribute to express
this on a per-buffer basis.

Thanks,
Isaac
