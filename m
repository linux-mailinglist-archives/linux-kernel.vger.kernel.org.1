That could be pretty clean, I hadn't though about it that way. Some questio=
ns:

- Being a PCIe device the XHCI controller doesn't show up in the device-tre=
e. I
  guess it could be added as a child node of pcie-brcmstb, but is that even
  acceptable?

- Same goes for xhci-pci being a consumer of the reset controller. Given th=
e
  reset scheme is board specific (the chip can be found all over the place,=
 but
  the firmware loading scheme is 100% RPi specific), to what extent we can
  introduce that as a binding?

Regards,
Nicolas
