Right, so when the system is operating normally, then the accounting is
correct.  When the reschedule path is being explicitly traced, then
the accounting will be doubled for it.

What's being proposed for ARM is to always have this mis-accounting,
where no mis-accounting was present before - and some of us (me) /do/
enable IRQ accounting in our kernels as standard. So, you can take
this as a kernel regression report from a user.

Yes, but is there anyone who cares about this for MIPS?
