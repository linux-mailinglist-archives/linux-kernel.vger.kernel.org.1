Adding it back later on with a loadable device driver should
not be a problem, as this is not a violation of the boot protocol.

Thank you for the detailed explanation. I've never seen this done
in the Linux boot flow, but I can see how it helps prevent certain
kinds of attacks.

It seems that just reserving the u-boot area and optionally
freeing it later from a driver solves most of your problem.
I have one related question though: if the kernel itself is
protected, does that mean that any driver that does a DMA
to statically allocated memory inside of the kernel is broken
as well? I think this is something that a couple of USB drivers
do, though it is fairly rare. Does u-boot protect both only
the executable sections of the kernel or also data, and does
the hardware block both read and write on the IMR, or just
writes?
