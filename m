my bad. thanks for pointing that out.

Instead of moving WARN_ON to macro as it requires mhi_cntrl->max_chan to 
compare, how about just adding WARN_ON statement above if condition like 
this

		WARN_ON(chan >= mhi_cntrl->max_chan);
		/*
  		 * Only process the event ring elements whose channel
		 * ID is within the maximum supported range.
		 */
  		if (chan < mhi_cntrl->max_chan) {
                       	mhi_chan = &mhi_cntrl->mhi_chan[chan];
                        	parse_xfer_event(mhi_cntrl, local_rp, mhi_chan);
                           	event_quota--;
  		}
  		break;

yeah idea is to have total count of events processed even if channel id 
is not correct for that event. This fix is a security fix considering 
that the MHI device is considered as non-secured and MHI host is trying
to continue function normally and just reporting it as warning.

Even this function has the same goto statement. For consistency i would 
do same thing here as well. Let me know what do you think about above 
suggestion for both functions.
