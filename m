Okay, so, I feel like this has gotten off into the weeds, or I'm really
dense (or both). :) Going back to the original comment:

I think there was some confusion about mixing the "we want to be able to
wipe the value" combined with the masking in __scs_base(). These are
unrelated, as was correctly observed with "We can still clear the base".

What I don't understand here is the suggestion to store two values:

Why is two better than storing one? With one, we only need a single access.

Why would storing the base be "friendlier on the allocations later on"?
This is coming out of a single kmem cache, in 1K chunks. They will be
naturally aligned to 1K (unless redzoing has been turned on for some
slab debugging reason). The base masking is a way to avoid needing to
store two values, and only happens at task death.

Storing two values eats memory for all tasks for seemingly no meaningful
common benefit. What am I missing here?
