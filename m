I was quite confused by the above comment. Does it mean that we need
a barrier here? Or does it explain why the cmpxchg has its own
LMM marker?

I think that we actually need a full barrier here to make sure that
all CPUs see the changes made by data_push_tail() before we
allow to rewrite the descriptor. The changes in data_push_tail() might
be done on different CPUs.

It is similar like the full barrier in data_push_tail() before changing
data_ring->tail_lpos.

Best Regards,
Petr
