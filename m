It depends on what you mean by =E2=80=9CVMLAUNCH/VMRESUME=E2=80=9D. If =
you only consider the
instructions themselves, as Sean did in vmx_vmenter() and vmx_vmexit(),
there is no problem. Even if you consider saving the general purpose
registers as done in __vmx_vcpu_run() - that=E2=80=99s relatively easy.

I think that anything that is greater than that, for instance
vmx_vcpu_run(), would require more thought and effort. KVM =
data-structures,
specifically kvm_vcpu and friends, would need to be broken into general =
and
KVM specific structures. I am really not sure that the end result would =
be
much better than using KVM user-space interfaces.

I can ask someone from the VMware hypervisor developers to provide =
VMware
point-of-view, but it would help to know when do you plan to make such a
change take, and whether there would be some transition stage. Adapting =
a
hypervisor to use different low-level interfaces would require quite =
some
development & testing effort.
