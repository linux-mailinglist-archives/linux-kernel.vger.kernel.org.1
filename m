I do remember seeing this commit while working on this, I guess I
ignored it in my attempts to get fstrim working on my rootfs, woops.

On my system I have a HDD and an SSD, with /boot on MD RAID and / on
ext4 on DM RAID on 2 DM crypt volumes. In this setup fstrim works on
/boot but does not work on / and with my patches it works on / again.
In addition I don't see any messages in dmesg or other issues when
doing fstrim / with my patches.

I think I might have been worried that discards_supported has other
side effects but grepping the code now I see that was unfounded.
I'll switch the next version to just setting discards_supported.
I still think that my proposed overboard design is clearer though :)

You'll see from the following command that MD raid 0/1/10 arrays enable
discards when any device supports discards:

   git grep -wW discard_supported

It appears that the block layer ignores discard requests when the queue
for the block device indicates that discard is not supported on it:

   git grep -wW __blkdev_issue_discard

It seems to me that where possible DM/MD letting the block layer decide
to pass on or ignore discard requests is the right design. I'm possibly
incorrectly assuming that all block device drivers will correctly
advertise support for discard without false positive/negatives.

BTW, any idea where I should fix the `fstrim --fstab` issue? It is
expecting the queue/discard_granularity sysfs entry to be non-zero.
=46rom my initial debugging attempts it seems raid_io_hints is at fault.

Thanks for your initial response and any further insight you can give.
