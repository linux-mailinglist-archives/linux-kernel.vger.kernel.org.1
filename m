Agreed. I tried to note this in my cover letter but perhaps I could have
written it better.

I still included it because I think the check.c portion of this RFC shows
what it would look like to add a hypothetical objtool subcommand implemented
for only one architecture (which "check" is, currently, an example of). I
don't think this RFC shows what should happen to check.c in particular.
You folks have been working on that here and I don't wish to disturb your
work.

Yeah. HAVE_C_RECORDMCOUNT is used in the Makefiles to select building
an running objtool mcount versus recordmcount.pl (which is another piece
that needs some attention -- my preference is to slowly move arch
support from there into recordmcount.c. So far it looks like s390 and mips
are the ones needing a little special attention there..)

My recollection is Josh wanted to avoid a bunch of architecture/config
checks in the code if I recall. It leaks into the code that implements the
subcommand tables, for example, and that's why I chose to use weak symbols --
we can unconditionally add the table entries and we don't need to play
linker script + macro games to build the array.

As for managing minor architectural variations in a single subcommand, either
those can use more weak symbols via arch/foo/subcmd.[ch] files or via explicit
checks in the code (see the arch, endian, and class switches in recordmcount.c
for the latter). If folks are OK with using weak symbols I'm curious what
preferences are on choosing when to use which method -- the RFC reflects
mine of course but I want to know what makes it more maintainable for
other folks.
