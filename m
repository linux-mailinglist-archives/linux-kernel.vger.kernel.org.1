Yes, sorry I should have mentioned the sync+drop_caches in the
description.

Yes, I can confirm that this also fixes the issue -- both tests pass.
__ceph_is_file_opened() uses some internal counters per inode, incremented
each time a file is open in a specific mode.  The problem is that these
counters require some extra locking (maybe they should be atomic_t?), so
you're suggestion is probably better.

Yeah, but the only test-case failing with cephfs is the one described
above (i.e. "open_by_handle -dkr ...").

Unless Jeff has any objection, I'm happy sending v2, simplifying the patch
to use your simpler solution (and mentioning sync+drop_caches in the
commit message).
