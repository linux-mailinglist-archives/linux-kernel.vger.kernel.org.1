I was following the discussion on the Max10 BMC driver to determine which way to go:

https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=159964043207829&w=2

My understanding was that the existing function wrappers were accepted because:

(1) The functions are adding dev_err() calls that would have to be replicated
for each call if we don't create a new function.
(2) The _sys_ macros are adding a base address offset, which facilitates
sharing code between multiple devices (although only the n3000 is supported with
the current patches).

Would you prefer that we handle these on a case by case basis? And only provide
wrappers for the ones that have high usage?
