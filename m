Host needs to program msi_data to QCA6390 hardware components(lots of 
standard
rings), and this msi_data is used to generate MSI interrupt.  If kernel 
has
re-assigned msi_data to QCA6390 when irq migration happens, and this 
re-assigned
msi_data is written to QCA6390 PCIe config space only, standard rings 
still use
previous msi_data.

Yes. This patch involves MHI module, so send it separately.
There is another patch set for QCA6390 to support one MSI vector.

Not sure if per irq manner is needed for others, but ath11k doesn't need
per irq manner.
