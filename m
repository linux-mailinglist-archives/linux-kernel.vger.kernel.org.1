You are right, but that doesn't mean that it is desirable that some
tasks would be throttled unexpectedly too long because of the other's activity.
We already have that behavior for the direct reclaim and I have to say I
really hate it and had to spend a lot of time debugging latency issues.
Our excuse has been that the system is struggling at that time so any
quality of service is simply out of picture. I do not think the same
argument can be applied to memory.high which doesn't really represent a
mark when the memcg is struggling so hard to drop any signs of fairness
on the floor.

I believe I have asked in other email in this thread. Could you explain
why enforcint the requested target (memcg_nr_pages_over_high) is
insufficient for the problem you are dealing with? Because that would
make sense for large targets to me while it would keep relatively
reasonable semantic of the throttling - aka proportional to the memory
demand rather than the excess.
