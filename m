Hi Ming,

I am just looking at this again, and have some doubt on your concern [0].

 From checking blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter() specifically, don't we 
actually guard against this with the q->q_usage_counter mechanism? That 
is, an agent needs to grab a q counter ref when attempting the iter. 
This will fail when the queue IO sched is being changed, as we freeze 
the queue during this time, which is when the requests are freed, so no 
agent can hold a reference to a freed request then. And same goes for 
blk_mq_update_nr_requests(), where we freeze the queue.

But I didn't see such a guard for blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter().

Thanks,
John
