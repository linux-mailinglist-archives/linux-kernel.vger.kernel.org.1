Oops, nothing, my fault.  We fixed up the allocation of more dynamic
majors for chardev in 2017 and for some reason I thought we also
increased the number of misc dynamic minors at the same time, but that
was incorrect.

I'll gladly take patches that bump up the number of misc minors if
needed.

But to get back to the main issue here, you are only going to have 1 or
maybe 2 of these devices in a system at a time, right?  So "burning" a
whole major number for that feels like a waste.
