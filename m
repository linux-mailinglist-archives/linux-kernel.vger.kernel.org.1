In order to make it even possible to write documentation, I'd like to constrain
what "a developer" means a bit more. Someone who comes decides to use this
flag will at least get a clear indication of what's involved, and I would
expect that if it's still not clear, they would take a slightly deeper look.

So "a developer unfamiliar with the implementation of memory reserves" is
probably going to get into trouble if they remain unfamiliar. This documentation
should inspire them to learn what they need to learn.

Well...but now we're sort of back to the original documentation anyway. I
like the idea of putting in a bit about "you're supposed to be doing something
that frees up memory" in the comments, because it is a lot more concrete.

Because it's pretty hard to figure out what "be careful, there's not much
left" really means, in terms of code that one writes. :)
