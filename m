Do you suggest we will create a new modifier 'U' as a follow-up patch?

cycles:u - Count host user space but it doesn't count the guest user space (exclude_host = 0, 
exclude_guest = 1, exclude_kernel = 1, exclude_user = 0, exclude_hv = 1)

cycles:U - Count the guest user space but it doesn't count the host user space (exclude_host = 1, 
exclude_guest = 0, exclude_kernel = 1, exclude_user = 0, exclude_hv = 1)

Is above understanding correct?

Thanks
Jin Yao
