The subject is generally the task which is causing the event to occur,
"subject info" would be any such attribute which describes the
subject; examples include LSM label, the various UIDs/GIDs, etc..

Think "current->cred" and you on the right track.

Once again - and I don't know how else to explain this to you - I
think it is pointless to record the subject info in this record as we
either have that info from other records in the event or there is no
valid subject info to record.  As you state in the commit description:

  "Some table unregister actions seem to be initiated by the
   kernel to garbage collect unused tables that are not
   initiated by any userspace actions."

As I've mentioned in the thread above, including the auid was done as
a concession to Steve, I don't think it serves any useful purpose.
