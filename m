Rather naming the effort after the I/T sector seems right. The whole of 
I/T sector is in this, and describes the involved dynamics.
Also is an indicator of what kind of quality we want in this.

- no 10ms filters in sched.c
- realtime audio threads probably good possibly h/w accelerated, also 
for production.
- low jitter overall for desktop and server.
- tight configs gets better gaming on *nix
etc.

: itX

- even compliant with monotheism, and Óne Dewa without company, as a 
global target of optimal economics, clear example of needs work = India, 
who needs to drop the idea of elephant gods etc. And after the 70s it 
seems the concept is more relevant than ever.

Serene Greetings,
