Just noticed that this patchset and the followup[1] for sync with inclusive
terms commit[2] are dropped from -mm tree.  I admit it could generate some
false positive warnings, though my followup patch[3] makes the message noisy
but gives clear references.

I still believe it's better to provide the messages, but I also know people
could think differently.  After all, the biggest part of the initial goal of
this patches is already made by the inclusive terms commit[2].  So, I would
respect the decision.
