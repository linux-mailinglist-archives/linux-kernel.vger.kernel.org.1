No - I have around 30GB of memory available on the LX2160A system, and
around 3GB that the above is crunching through.

In some of these cases I have observed, the inode appears not to have
changed for quite a long time - it seems to be "media read due to
iget -> checksum failure", although I can't say that definitively.

Given that most of the instances I've been able to provoke over the last
two days have been on the LX2160A, and have been a case of "power on
from cold, boot, login, run the above command, it fails on the first
iteration", it's unlikely that there's much in the way of inode
modification going on.

I've had a few instances now where, for example:

recalculated = 5cec3c81
EXT4-fs error (device nvme0n1p2): ext4_lookup:1707: inode #270077: comm md5sum: iget: checksum invalid

The reason this is interesting is that the hexdump is _correct_ for
the stored checksum (which is 0x4b98d7c4 - stored at hex offsets +83,
+82, +7d, +7c). However, the initial calculation when validating the
inode was incorrect, and the recalculation after dumping the data was
_also_ incorrect.

As mentioned on my writeup on www.armlinux.org.uk (please read it,
there's lots of information there about the history of this and what
has been tried, including the patch for the above output, and I don't
want to keep having to repeat it in emails as different people ask
the same question!) I've already tried disabling the ARM64 accelerated
CRC32 code, and that has made no difference to this problem.

One thing I have recently been trying is to disable preemption within
ext4_inode_csum_verify() - that _seems_ to make it much harder to
reproduce the problem. I've managed it only once despite trying
multiple times. Unfortunately, the filesystem was not mounted
errors=remount-ro, so I couldn't verify the hexdump.

I'm also trying booting with maxcpus=2, so that the kernel is limited
to a single CPU cluster. So far, I haven't been able to provoke the
problem. However, this means absolutely nothing, as past experience
has shown it may take up to three months to occur.

There's a thought that this problem could have something to do with
migrating across CPUs in different clusters (hence why trying
maxcpus=2). The LX2160A has 16 CPUs - 8 clusters of 2 CPUs. The Armada
8040 has 2 clusters of 2 CPUs. As I understand it, the bcm2711 has four
CPUs which aren't separated into clusters.

This may explain why, /if/ ext4_inode_csum_verify() migrating between
the clusters is important to trigger this, it hasn't been seen on any
Raspberry Pis (I'm also told that Raspbian defaults to 32-bit kernels
which may be another factor why there haven't been people reporting
this.)

Well, replacing the __iormb() barrier with a dsb appears to either solve
the problem or make it much less likely to happen - although Will Deacon
feels that this is plastering over the problem, and it will come back to
bite in the future.

However, I have put a kernel on one of the affected systems (which is a
long-running system) that revert's Will's 22ec71615d82 commit I mention
above. This /was/ the situation before 5.4-rc1, and it seems to allow
these platforms to work. If that proves to be stable in six months time,
and there has been no other progress on this bug, then as far as I'm
concerned, that is quite simply the required fix for this.

Quite simply, I've given up with Aarch64 over the last year over this;
it doesn't interest me at the moment - not even for development of
other stuff - as fundamentally I have had my trust in it totally
shattered.  ARM32 is clearly the superior architecture! :)

Yes, except for the patch to dump out a hexdump of the inode on
checksum failure and to then recalculate it.
