Maybe so, but it's still "wrong" to do that, because it only works more
or less accidentally. That is, it works in spite of a type safety
violation. So we don't want to do that sort of thing unless there is
a compelling reason.

In addition to that, I am at the exact moment putting together a minor
refactoring of this function, because I need a FOLL_PIN variant:
__pin_user_pages_fast(), as part of my work to change over a few dozen
gup call sites to pin_user_pages*().

(In fact, I was wondering whether to stick with the "write" parameter, for
the new __pin_user_pages_fast(), or go with gup_flags. That could go either
way: gup_flags provides a nicer API, but "write" matches the existing
callers.)

So in other words, if you do go out and change all the call sites (there only
seem to be about 7, outside of gup.c, actually), that's going to conflict
a little bit with what I'm doing here.

So, how would you like proceed? If you want to do the full conversion
(which really should include the call sites), it would be easier for me
if you based it on my upcoming small patchset, which I expect to post
shortly (later today).

thanks,
