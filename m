[ I somehow munged the To: header in the last mail. Sorry about that,
it's fixed now. ]

Hmm, I was not able to reproduce this with a cross-compiled kernel
using the attached config (gcc 9.3.0 with vanilla v5.8 kernel). I am
curious if the failing sections are also SHF_ALLOC - in that case, the
code is doing what it is intended to do, which is rejecting loading
any modules with writable and executable sections. If the problematic
sections are *not* SHF_ALLOC, then we might be able to work around
that by ignoring non-SHF_ALLOC sections as they are not copied to the
final module location anyway.
