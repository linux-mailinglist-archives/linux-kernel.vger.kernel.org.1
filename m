I guess that's my question: when is x7 "disturbed".

Other than sigreturn, I can't think of a case.

I'm likely missing some aspect of what you're trying to do.

Since rt_sigreturn emulation was always broken, can we just say
that the effect of updating any reg other than x0 is unspecified in this
case?

Even fixing the x7 issue won't magically teach your tracer how to
deal with unrecognised data in the signal frame, so new hardware or
a new kernel could cause your tracer to become subtly broken.  Would you
be better off tweaking the real signal frame as desired and doing a real
rt_sigreturn for example, instead of attempting to emulate it?


I'm somewhat playing devil's advocate here...
