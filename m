Dr. Greg, I know you like sending these emails, but they're not really
helpful for Linux kernel development.  Please see below.

I read this three times, and I can't tell what functionality you're
referring to.

It's completely unreviewable.  It's an ABI patch, and it does not
document what it does, nor does it document why it does it.  It's just
a bunch of code.  NAK.

To be crystal clear, I will not review, and I will NAK outright, any
patches of this sort, until ALL of the following conditions are met:

a) Either a functioning SGX driver lands in a -rc kernel or there is
an excellent justification for why a change of this sort is needed
prior to a release.  Dr. Greg, you seem to be interested in SGX
actually landing upstream, but these patches are just causing delays.
Please stop.

b) The patch needs to explain what problem it solves and why it is a
good solution to that problem.

c) The patch needs to explain, either in a changelog or in a text file
in the patch, *exactly* what it does.  Imagine MSDN-like documentation
in the good old days.  The documentation needs to be sufficiently
clear that a userspace programmer could use your mechanism without
reference to your implementation and that a kernel programmer could,
in principle, re-implement your code from the description.

Unless all three of these are met, your patch is going nowhere, and I
think no one should waste their time trying to read it.

You have sent this change repeatedly, and now for some reason you're
sending it mixed in with unrelated changes.  Please stop.  At no point
have you explained why this approach is better than anything else.  It
has the obnoxious side effect that you can't usefully SCM_RIGHTS an
enclave to a different process with your patch applied, which is at
least a minor disadvantage.  You have not explained any advantage to
your patch at all.

Dr Greg, before you hit send on further emails about SGX, could you
kindly try to imagine you're a kernel maintainer, read your own email,
and consider whether how to make it add something useful to the
discussion?

Thanks,
Andy
