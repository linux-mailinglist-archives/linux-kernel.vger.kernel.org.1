Err, you fixed the SOB on patches 1-3, but now broke 4+.

SOB from you meets the developers certificate of origin.

SOB from Hemant here, is confusing.  This would normally signal that 
Hemant is sending a patch you authored (ie patches 1-3 are authored by 
Hemant but you posted them to list), and he is attesting that he has the 
right to do so (certificate of origin), but this email came from you. 
This doesn't add up.

If you are trying to imply that Hemant wrote this change with you, there 
is a Co-authored-by tag you can use (goes before the SOB) to indicate 
multiple authors since git only has a single author field.  The 
Documentation/process/submitting-patches I pointed out on v1 should have 
the details for this.

Otherwise, you are listed as the author, and the patch has your SOB, 
therefore nothing else is needed.
