Some test results on a system with 96 CPUs and 192GB of memory:

Without this patch series:
[    0.487132] node 0 initialised, 23398907 pages in 292ms
[    0.499132] node 1 initialised, 24189223 pages in 304ms
...
[    0.629376] Run /sbin/init as init process

With this patch series:
[    0.227868] node 0 initialised, 23398907 pages in 28ms
[    0.230019] node 1 initialised, 24189223 pages in 28ms
...
[    0.361069] Run /sbin/init as init process

That makes a huge difference; memory initialization is the largest
remaining component of boot time.

Cloud systems and other virtual machines may have a huge amount of
memory but not necessarily run for a long time; on such systems, boot
time becomes critically important. Reducing boot time on cloud systems
and VMs makes the difference between "leave running to reduce latency"
and "just boot up when needed".
