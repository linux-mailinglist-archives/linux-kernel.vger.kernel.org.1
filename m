If I could pick the ideal, I'd say we'd do it any time the console is
configured for that port and magic sysrq is enabled.  Presumably if
they're already choosing to output kernel log messages to the serial
port and they've enabled magic sysrq they're in a state where they'd
be OK with the extra power of also listening for characters?

Don't get me wrong.  Having sysrq from NMI seems like a good feature
to me.  That being said, it will require non-trivial changes to each
serial driver to support it and that means that not all serial drivers
will support it.  It also starts requiring knowledge of how NMIs work
(what's allowed in NMI mode / not allowed / how to avoid races) for
authors of serial drivers.  I have a bit of a worry that the benefit
won't outweigh the extra complexity, but I guess time will tell.  One
last worry is that I assume that most people testing (and even
automated testing labs) will either always enable NMI or won't enable
NMI.  That means that everyone will be only testing one codepath or
the other and (given the complexity) the non-tested codepath will
break.

Hrm.  Along the lines of the above, though: almost no modern systems
are uniprocessor.  That means that even if one CPU is stuck with IRQs
off it's fairly likely that some other CPU is OK.  Presumably you'd
get almost as much benefit as your patch but with more done
automatically if you could figure out how to detect that the serial
interrupt isn't being serviced and re-route it to a different CPU.
...or possibly you could use some variant of the hard lockup detector
and move all interrupts off a locked up CPU?  You could make this an
option that's "default Y" when kgdb is turned on or something?
