Hi,

The last days I was busy with job-hunting, so this is my prio #1.
Thus I was not very responsive.

And I am sorry to mixup different threads in ClangBuiltLinux and elsewhere.

WOW Huh ***Votings***!

Originally the patchset from Nick had LD_IS_BFD, LD_IS_GOLD and LD_IS_LLD.

As pointed out GOLD is no more suitable to link the kernel and thus
deactivated (AFAICS Thomas Gleixner did this).

Personally, I am OK with ***LD_IS_LD*** because we have now
***LD_VERSION*** which was introduced in Linux v5.7-rc1.
We have the pair LD_IS_LD and LD_VERSION like CC_IS_GCC and GCC_VERSION.
The only thing I would like to be changed is the comment in
***scripts/ld-version.sh*** to mention "GNU/ld (binutils)" if you
decide for LD_IS_LD or not.
But I am OK with LD_IS_BFD.
If you ask people what they come into mind when speaking of "ld" - 99%
of the answers of this people will point to GNU/ld from GNU/binutils.
This is simply a fact in the Linux-kernel world.

I am living in my x86 world and do not test with cross-compilation or
any other archs like ARM or MIPS or whatever.
So, I might not catch all corner-cases.

Some bots like kbuild-bot(?) already sent some warnings on my patchset.

My ***main interest*** is to have good support of ***LLD*** which is
my primary linker.

Why?
(Might be off-topic here in this thread)

"Numbers talk, bullshit walks." (Linus Torvalds)

Please, compile yourself (here: Debian/testing AMD64)...

#1: gcc 9.3 with GNU/ld (binutils)
#2: gcc 9.3 with ld.lld-10
#3: clang-10 and ld.lld-10

I have not the same code-base to compare, but first numbers:

Even the combo of gcc-9.3 and ld.lld-10 produces 5GiB more disc-space
in my linux-git.
The debug binaries and the resulting Debian debug packages are
significantly bigger

As said - not the same code and patch base!

This needs definitely to be investigated.

LLD seems to be - seen from the numbers - be a lot of "smarter".

Have more fun!

Regards and happy first day of Ramadan if you celebrate it,
- Sedat -

P.S.: A build of Linux v5.7-rcX with gcc-9.3 as compiler is much much
faster here.
