Also just worker threads in general. Instead of waking up
an idle worker thread every time a new request comes in,
why not allow worker threads to indicate "I'm almost done",
and the main/receiving thread to enqueue the new request,
to be handled when the worker thread is done with the current
request?

The work case above also needs to have that figured out,
for the (slow path, but still common) case of the worker
thread actually having gone to sleep while the work got
enqueued, and then needing to be woken up anyway.

Not sure that is a direction you are interested in, given
the description, but it could make coroutines and worker
threads more efficient :)
