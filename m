Yes.  There's overhead to back-charge.  To reduce the overhead, instead
of back-charge immediately, we can

- Add one field to task_struct, say backcharge_time, to track the
  delayed back-charged CPU time.

- When the work item completes its work, add the CPU time it spends to
  task_struct->backcharge_time atomically

- When the task account CPU regularly, e.g. in scheduler_tick(),
  task_struct->backcharge is considered too.

Although this cannot eliminate the overhead, it can reduce it.  Do you
think this is acceptable or not?

Best Regards,
Huang, Ying
