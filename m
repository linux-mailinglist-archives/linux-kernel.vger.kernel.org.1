Yes.

The easiest through a separate branch. Assuming that such need for
sharing patches is known.

If the patches touch generic things, which could be used by other
drivers/subsystems, or if it is known that there will be someone
depending on them, the easiest is to put them on separate branch which
you later merge into your for-next. You send to Greg your for-next. If
these patches are needed by someone else, e.g. me, you prepare a tag
on them and send a pull request with that tag. I pull it and send
these (and only these!) along with other patches. No duplication of
commits, only two merges.

Recent example was here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200819191722.GA38371@sirena.org.uk/
where Mark Brown wanted these through his tree, but later work on
Samsung ARM depended on them.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
