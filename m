I thought about this again and I think the best option is to rename
CONFIG_FB_OMAP2 to something like CONFIG_FB_OMAP2_DEPRECATED and
update the help text. That way anyone with CONFIG_FB_OMAP2 in
their .config will definitely notice the change when upgrading to
a newer kernel, but can easily fix it temporarily. Help text could
be

"This driver will be removed in 2022, please switch to omapdrm."

and no other intermediate steps are required that way :)

But while looking through CONFIG_FB_OMAP2 references I noticed there
is also a V4L2 driver (CONFIG_VIDEO_OMAP2_VOUT), which seems to
only work with omapfb. IIUIC that driver provides display overlays
to V4L. I guess on omapdrm V4L can use DRM planes instead and no
driver is needed (i.e. this driver could just go away with omapfb)?
