I don't think this is quite that simple. Yes, the MDS is certainly
giving back stray inodes in response to a lookup-by-ino request. But
that's for a specific purpose: we need to be able to give back caps on
unlinked-but-open files. For NFS specifically, I don't know what the
rules are on NFS file handles and unlinked files, but the Ceph MDS
won't know when files are closed everywhere, and it translates from
NFS fh to Ceph inode using that lookup-by-ino functionality.

But the NFS file handles I think do work across clients, right?
