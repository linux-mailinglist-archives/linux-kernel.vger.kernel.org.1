Ah yes, I was curious if those should be applied here.  Their use seems 
inconsistent.  I will do that.

I'm going to have to disagree.  While most "sane" compilers would not 
add extra padding, I've debugged enough issues in the past when 
sending/receiving data with foreign environments to never trust anything 
that isn't "packed".

Unless I missed something in the C spec that requires naturally aligned 
structures to have an identical layout in memory, I'll take safety and 
functional correctness over performance.

The barrier(s) that comes with writel are unnecessary in this case. 
Since this is part of our critical path, we are sensitive to its 
performance.

What are the portability issues around the __raw variant?

Fair enough.

Same answer as before.

Huh.  That actually does sound more elegant.  Will do.
