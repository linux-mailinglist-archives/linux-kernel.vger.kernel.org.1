This doesn't hold for systemd (if we agree that systemd is the most
common case).

There's cgroup.max.descendants for that...

=2E..oh, so is this limiting the number of cgroups or limiting resources
used?

If we reach the situation when memory for cgroup operations is tight,
it'll disappoint the user either way.
My premise is that a running workload is more valuable than the
accompanying manager.

In my understanding, "onbehalveness" is a concept useful for various
kernel threads doing deferred work. Here it's promoted to user processes
managing cgroups.

If the charge goes to the parent of created cgroup (job-cgroup-i here),
then the layer adds nothing. Am I missing something?

> I'd definitely charge the parent cgroup in all similar cases.
(This would mandate the controllers on the unified hierarchy, which is
fine IMO.) Then the order of enabling controllers on a subtree (e.g.
cpu,memory vs memory,cpu) by the manager would yield different charging.
This seems wrong^W confusing to me.=20
