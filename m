The whole OC is based on experiments to come to correct values. This
depends on whole system design not just CPUs.

It warns about system stability.

> Srinivas, what's the story here?
I checked and there is no public spec. There are several mailbox
commands with version dependent on the processor.

The actual OC mailbox implementation itself is implemented in Linux in
intel_turbo_max_3 driver. So that is public.
So someone can develop a driver and provide some sysfs to send mailbox
commands, but kernel can't validate commands which can cause any
security or stability issues. Not sure if this is acceptable standard.
I don't think there is any precedent of creating such blind sysfs
entries.


Thanks,
Srinivas
