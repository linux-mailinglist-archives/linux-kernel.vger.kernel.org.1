While I agree with goal here, these are two very different things, due
to the completely different nature of PV and HVM/PVH guests.

HVM/PVH guests have a concrete guest physical address space.  Linux
needs to pick some gfn's to use which aren't used by anything else (and
Xen's behaviour of not providing any help here is deeply unhelpful, and
needs fixing), and get struct page_info's for them.

PV is totally different.  Linux still needs page_info's for them, but
there is no concept of a guest physical address space.  You can
literally gain access to foreign mappings or grant maps by asking Xen to
modify a PTE.  For convenience with the core code, Linux tries to map
this concept back into a 1:1 pfn space, but it is quite fictitious.
