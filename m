I've just updated that branch with a new version which I hope covers
kernel<->kernel transitions too. If you get a chance, would you mind
giving that a spin?

The HEAD commit should be:

  a51334f033f8ee88 ("HACK: check IRQ tracing has RCU watching")

Otherwise, I intend to clean that up and post it tomorrow (without the
additional debug hacks). I've thrown my local Syzkaller instance at it
in the mean time (and if I get the chance tomrrow I'll try to get
rcutorture setup), and the only report I'm seeing so far looks genuine:

| BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context in sta_info_move_state

... as that was reported on x86 too, per:

https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=6c7899acf008be2ddcddb46a2567c2153193632a

Thanks,
Mark.
