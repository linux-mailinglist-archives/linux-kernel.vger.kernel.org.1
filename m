We're planning to have a session about this topic (latency-nice
attribute per task group) during the virtual Pisa OSPM summit
retis.sssup.it/ospm-summit in May this year.

There are two presentations/discussions planned:

"Introducing Latency Nice for Scheduler Hints and Optimizing Scheduler
Task Wakeup" and "The latency nice use case for Energy-Aware-Scheduling
(EAS) in Android Common Kernel (ACK)"

We'll probably merge those two into one presentation/discussion.

So far we have Parth's per-task implementation

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200228090755.22829-1-parth@linux.ibm.com

What's missing is the per-taskgroup implementation, at least from the
standpoint of ACK.

The (mainline) EAS use-case for latency nice is already in ACK
(android-5.4):
