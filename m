I'm still wonder what the exact failure case is though; exit_mm() is on
the exit path (as the name very much implies) and the thread is about to
die. The context switch that follows guarantees a full barrier before we
run anything else again.

I'm as puzzled by that comment as are you.

It does seem to be required for glorious stuff like get_task_mm()
though.

So like stated above, I'm not sure how missing that IPI is going to be a
problem, we're dying...
