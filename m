Thanks.  These look good.  We're still trying to get our merge process
worked out, and tip/objtool/core is now pretty old, but these apply well
enough.

If there are no more comments I can fix up the few minor comments I had
and then try to get them merged after your other set (once Peter and I
figure out how to do that :-)
