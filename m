I have made some comments.  The thrust of which is:
- get all the UHS-II code into sdhci-uhs2 (not sdhci.c)
- make the driver (i.e sdhci-pci-gli) set existing mmc host ops callbacks
and sdhci host ops callbacks as much as possible to provide UHS-II
functionality i.e. avoid adding new hooks if possible
- refactoring and exporting functions from sdhci.c where that can be done
logically, but otherwise writing separate code for UHS-II
