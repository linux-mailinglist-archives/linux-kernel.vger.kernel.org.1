Could you provide an example please?

So here, instead of just failing a single device, we fail everything?
Sounds a lot like throwing the baby out with the bath water.  How is
that an improvement?

I think I just threw-up a little. ;)

Did you read the commit message?

  "We could code around this with some pre-parsing semantics, but the
  added complexity required to cover each and every corner-case is not
  justified.  Merely patching the current failing (via this patch) is
  already working with some pretty small corner-cases"
  
Providing thorough pre-parsing would be highly complex and highly
error prone.  The example you provide above is not only ugly, there
are numerous issues with it.  Not least:

 * Only one corner-case is covered
 * Validation is only completed on a single mfd_cells struct
 * False positives can occur and will fail as a result

The above actually makes the solution worse, not better.
