Yes, although we could follow the x86 approach:

1. Try low (ZONE_DMA for arm64) allocation, fallback to high allocation
   if it fails.

2. If crash_base is outside ZONE_DMA, call reserve_crashkernel_low()
   which either honours the ,low option or allocates some small amount
   in ZONE_DMA.

If at some point we have platforms failing step 2, we'll look at
changing ZONE_DMA to the full 4GB on non-RPi4 platforms.

It looks to me like x86 ignores the ,low option if the first step
managed to get some low memory. Shall we do the same on arm64?

The only question is whether we need to preserve some more ZONE_DMA on
the current system. If for example we pass a crashkernel=512M and some
cma=, we may end up with very little free memory in ZONE_DMA. That's
mostly an issue for RPi4 since other platforms would work with
ZONE_DMA32. We could add a threshold and go for high allocation directly
if the required size is too large.

If we can use this function almost intact, just move it in a common
place. But if it gets sprinkled with #ifdef CONFIG_ARM64, I'd rather
duplicate it. I'd still prefer to move it to a common place if possible.

You can go a step further and also move the x86 reserve_crashkernel() to
common code. I don't think there a significant difference between arm64
and x86 here. You'd have to define arch-specific specific
CRASH_ADDR_LOW_MAX etc.

Also patches moving code should not have any functional change. The
CRASH_ALIGN change from 16M to 2M on x86 should be a separate patch as
it needs to be acked by the x86 maintainers (IIRC, Ingo only acked the
function move if there was no functional change; CRASH_ALIGN is used for
the start address, not just alignment, on x86).
