True. Although note that we require CONFIG_KCSAN=y for this test to be
enabled, so I don't think it's a big problem for a regular CI setups.
For a KCSAN setup, I'd expect that we know that running on a
single-core system doesn't yield much interesting results regardless
of tests being run.

The non-deterministic nature of concurrent tests will never entirely
go away, but I think with the right preconditions met (at least N
CPUs, where N depends on PREEMPT_NONE, PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY or PREEMPT)
the tests here should not normally fail.

That would be nice. For the time being, I will add a precondition
check to test_init(), and print a warning if the test needs to be
skipped.

Right, let me try to fix those at least. I'll send v2.

(Paul: If you prefer a separate patch rather than v2, let me know.)

The fragility due to formatting etc. for the sanitizers is exactly
what we want, since any change in console output could be a bug. But
as you say, for other tests, it might not make much sense.
