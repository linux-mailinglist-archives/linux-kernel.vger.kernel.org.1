That's a good point. rr only allows one tracee thread to run at a time
for other reasons, so when we consider patching a syscall instruction,
we inspect all thread states to see if the patch would interfere with
any other thread, and skip patching it in that unlikely case. (We'll
try to patch it again next time that instruction is executed.) Wine
would need some other solution, but indeed that could be a
showstopper.

This is no worse than for x86-64 `syscall`, which is also two bytes.
We have pretty much always been able to patch the frequently executed
syscalls by replacing both the syscall instruction and an instruction
before or after the syscall with a five-byte jump, and folding the
extra instruction into the stub.

We haven't found this to be much of a problem in rr. From time to time
we have to add new patch patterns. The good news is that if things
change so a syscall can't be patched, the result is degraded
performance, not functional breakage.

That's fair --- our solution is complex. (But worth it --- for us,
it's valuable that rr works on quite old Linux kernels.)

As for performance, it performs well for us. I think we'd prefer our
current approach to Andy's hypothetical PR_SET_SYSCALL_THUNK because
the latter would have higher overhead (two trips into the kernel per
syscall). We definitely don't want to require CAP_SYS_ADMIN so that
rules out any eBPF-based alternative too. I would love to see a
low-overhead unprivileged syscall interception mechanism that would
obsolete our patching approach --- preferably one that's also
stackable so rr can record and replay processes that use the new
mechanism --- but I don't think any of the proposals here are that,
yet, unfortunately.
