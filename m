On 2-socket machine (e.g cascadelakex), "cstate_pkg/c2-residency/" is per-socket 
event and the cpumask is 0 and 24.

root@lkp-csl-2sp5 /sys/devices/cstate_pkg# cat cpumask
0,24

We can't limit it to cpumask 0. It should be programmed on CPU0 and CPU24 (the 
first CPU on each socket).

The "msr/tsc" are per-cpu event, it should be programmed on all cpus. So I don't 
think we can limit msr/tsc to cpumask 0.

The issue is how we deal with get_group_fd().

static int get_group_fd(struct evsel *evsel, int cpu, int thread)
{
         struct evsel *leader = evsel->leader;
         int fd;

         if (evsel__is_group_leader(evsel))
                 return -1;

         /*
          * Leader must be already processed/open,
          * if not it's a bug.
          */
         BUG_ON(!leader->core.fd);

         fd = FD(leader, cpu, thread);
         BUG_ON(fd == -1);

         return fd;
}

When evsel is "msr/tsc/",

FD(leader, 0, 0) is 3 (3 is the fd of "cstate_pkg/c2-residency/" on CPU0)
FD(leader, 1, 0) is -1
BUG_ON asserted.

If we just return group_fd(-1) for "msr/tsc", it looks like it's not a problem, 
is it?

Thanks
