It didn't. I can't figure out what to charge on the locked memory, as
all that memory is in kernel-side objects. It also needs to make sense
as iirc the default MLOCK_LIMIT is quite low, you'd hit it sooner than
the file descriptor limit.

I don't see how to make this work in a sane way. Besides, if we have to
have a limit anyway, sticking with the existing one is just easier and
1:1 is kind of more logical.
