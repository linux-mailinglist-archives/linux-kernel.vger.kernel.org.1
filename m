yes, freq and perf state.

yes.

These are existing devices already upstream.

Well, it is to drop votes. But in cases where we don't have perf votes being put
(and only clock is scaled), the driver would still call this with freq = 0, i am
just making sure that in such cases its treated as a nop.

FWIK, no one should call a _of_add_opp_table_v2 in cases where there is no OPP in DT?
The 'empty' OPP table from what I understand will be created by dev_pm_opp_set_clkname.
A good case to look at is the PATCH 13/21 in this series. The driver I am modifying
is used on sdm845/sc7180 and a host of other older qualcomm SoCs. Since i am adding
support for perf state voting using OPP only on sdm845/sc7180 I want the existing
platforms to just do what they were doing. Now thats not possible unless I start
adding a bunch of if/else around every opp call in the driver to distinguish between
the two.

I am a little surprised since I though the idea of doing something like this came from
you :) (or perhaps Stephen, I somehow can't recollect) to avoid all the if/else conditions
I had when I initially posted some of these changes.
Btw, you had this patch reviewed when this was posted a long while back too [1]
