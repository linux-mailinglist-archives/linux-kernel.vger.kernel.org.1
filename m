Looking back at previous threads, you indicated that the number of 
channels supported in propagated from BE to FE, so a similar patch to 
add 2ch constraints for bwd-rt5677 was dropped  ("ASoC: bdw-rt5677: 
channel constraint support")

Actually I am not sure it was dropped since later you submitted another 
patch ("ASoC: bdw-rt5677: enable runtime channel merge"), and my 
feedback was that it seemed simpler to add constraints on all machine 
drivers.

And now this patch only addresses bdw-rt5650.c but with the initial 
solution suggested for bdw-rt5677.c

It seems like a generic problem on all Broadwell devices so let's solve 
with one a single patchset.

Shouldn't we just add the 2ch constraints for broadwell.c and 
bdw-rt5677.c, and the 2 or 4ch constraint for bdw-rt5650.c? Would this 
work for you?

Thanks
-Pierre
