I will do that once somebody tells me this patch is reasonable to
avoid wasting people's time.

I saw a function call being made to tomoyo_check_acl(). the next thing
happening is a kfree().
Also, spi_hash_byspi just returns spi % XFRM6_TUNNEL_SPI_BYSPI_HSIZE .

I'm a mentee, hence I would say my knowledge is very limited, please
let me know if I am making a horrible mistake somewhere,
but return (__force u32)(a->s6_addr32[0] ^ a->s6_addr32[1] ^
a->s6_addr32[2] ^ a->s6_addr32[3]); seems like a better because
as David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net> said "It is doing a XOR on
all bits of an IPv6 address, it is doing more bit shifting which the
existing hash was ignoring" .

Please help me understand this better if I am going wrong.

Aren't there indirect inet calls and netfilter hooks? I'm sorry I do
not see anything otherwise.
Please help me understand.
