Agreed. I am worried about in-kernel users setting random uclamp values too.

This series should do most of the work but there are more pieces needed on-top.

From what I see we still need to move the sched_setscheduler() from
include/linux/sched.h to kernel/sched/sched.h. And sched_setattr() too. The
latter has a single user in kernel/trace/trace_selftest.c to create a deadline
task. I think that can be easily wrapped with a similar sched_set_dl()
function and exported instead.

Happy to do the work if you nudge me after you've published this fix on tip or
your queue.

Thanks
