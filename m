I plan on dropping this patch as it looks like an unnecessary check 
since we
will always rely on the firmware->size from the request_firmware() API 
in order
to calculate the img_info->entries (or we can call it the number of 
segments, in
our case). And we will never fail in the if loop as values will already 
be
bounded.
