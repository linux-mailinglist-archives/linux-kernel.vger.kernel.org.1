yeah, it's microsecond range :(

FWIW - I think everyone on the DRM side is happy with the concept of vblank
workers, I think all that's really up for discussion at this point (ignoring
the nouveau patches that need Ben's OK) is just getting the code itself
reviewed and figuring out if we still want to use kthread_workers for this, or
if we should just go back to using kthreadd. At least, since it sounds like
there isn't much more we can do to improve on this latency-wise.
