Avoid having "This patch" or "This commit" in the commit message. It is
tautologically useless.

Also, do

$ git grep 'This patch' Documentation/process

for more details.

Yeah we have a lot of non-native speakers so "Banging" might be
confusing - please formulate less colloquial.

Please avoid the "we" in text as it is ambiguous - try formulating
passively like your commit message.

Let's keep those two tests separate:

	if (!__ratelimit(&fw_rs))
		return 0;

	if (reg == MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS)
		return 0;
