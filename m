This is not so much about non-genuine as about the adapter having
the wrong wattage. E.g. plugging a 65W adapter in a laptop which
has a 45W CPU + a 35W discrete GPU will not allow the laptop to
really charge while it is in use.

One issue I see with doing this in the power_supply class is that
the charger is represented by the standard ACPI AC adapter stuff,
which does not have this info. This sort of extra info comes from
WMI. Now we could have the WMI driver register a second power_supply
device, but that means having 2 power_supply devices representing
the 1 AC adapter which does not feel right.

I was myself actually thinking more along the lines of adding a
new mechanism to the kernel where the kernel can send messages
to userspace (either with some special tag inside dmesg, or through
a new mechanism) indication that the message should be shown
as a notification (dialog/bubble/whatever) inside the UI.

This could be useful for this adapter case, but e.g. also for
pluging a thunderbolt device into a non thunderbolt capable
Type-C port, a superspeed USB device into a USB-2 only USB
port and probably other cases.

Rather then inventing separate userspace APIs for all these
cases having a general notification mechanism might be
quite useful for this (as long as the kernel does not
over use it).

Regards,

Hans
