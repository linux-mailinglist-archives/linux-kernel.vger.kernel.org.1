This means that multiple monitoring threads can concurrently run.  This is an
intended design to let users utilize multiple CPUs.  For example, let's suppose
the user need super high accuracy of the monitoring results which require
multiple CPU power.  If use of the multiple CPUs are allowed, the user can
split the monitoring target regions into multiple contexts and call
'damon_start()' for each of the context.

If multiple monitoring threads has conflicting target regions, they will
interfere each other.  Currently, avoidance of such conflict should be done by
'damon_start()' users.  The synchronization would be complicated.

To make the situation simple, I will make the 'damon_start()' receive a group
of 'damon_ctx' objects and creates a group of monitoring threads for the
objects at once.  This will only reduce number of 'damon_start()' calls
required to run multiple monitoring threads.  In addition to this, the groups
of monitoring threads will be mutual exclusive.  In other words,
'damon_start()' will fail if a group of monitoring threads that started by
other 'damon_start()' call is currently running.

This still ask the users to protect each monitoring threads by taking care in
their requests.  But, because the requests are made by the user on its own,
avoiding the conflict will be quite easy.  Further, intentional conflict is
also possible, though I'm unsure how the intentional conflict can be required.

The change will be made in the next spin.
