Sorry, but NAK to this as-is. This is not a legitimate use of
dump_backtrace(), and even if we wanted to dump a backtrace of a
remotely running task, the patch is:

* Insufficient, since a remotely running task can become blocked after
  task_curr() is sampled.

* Insufficient and incorrect, since the task can be rescheduled after
  task->cpu is sampled. This patch could cause *another* task to dump a
  stacktrace.

* Unsafe, since tsk->cpu is accessed racily. In practice we'd likely get
  away with that, but it's not something we should rely on.

* Unsafe, since if this were ever called in IRQ context it could result
  in a deadlock.

Taking a step back, please explain *why* you think you need this?

What code in mainline is calling dumop_backtrace() on a remotely running
task?

Thanks,
Mark.
