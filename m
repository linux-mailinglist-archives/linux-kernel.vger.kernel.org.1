LKFT has recently added testing with KASAN enabled and improved the
kernel log parsing to catch more of this class of errors while
performing our regular functional testing.

Incidentally, -next was also broken for us from March 25 through April 5
due to a perf build failure[0], which eventually made itself all the way
down into v5.6 release and I believe the first two 5.6.x stable
releases.

For -next, LKFT's gap is primarily reporting. We do build and run over
30k tests on every -next daily release, but we send out issues manually
when we see them because triaging is still a manual effort. We're
working to build better automated reporting. If anyone is interested in
watching LKFT's -next results more closely (warning, it's a bit noisy),
please let me know. Watching the results at https://lkft.linaro.org
provides some overall health indications, but again, it gets pretty
difficult to figure out signal from noise once you start drilling down
without sufficient context of the system.
