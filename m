Yes, more or less.  It could be considered a little more
nuanced than even that, but I won't get into it here.

If the IPA driver successfully loads this firmware, it should
be assumed to never crash.  So in that respect, there is no
recovery required.

Again, the modem (with which the IPA hardware and driver
interacts) can crash, or it can be shut down intentionally.
And in either case it can recover, automatically or manually.
But all of that (and the modem's firmware loading) is the
responsibility of the remoteproc subsystem, not IPA.

We can't guarantee anything about recovering from a crash of
an independent entity.  But by design, recovery from a modem
crash is possible and is supposed to leave Linux in a
consistent state.  A modem crash is likely to be observable
to the user.

I'll repeat that I don't believe the new call you inserted
in the IPA driver belongs there.
