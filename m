IIRC the loop was added because on some versions of the hardware we seem 
to miss stream interrupts - and I believe this was inspired by the same 
solution with the legacy HDaudio driver.

Maybe we need to do something better for unsolicited responses but I'd 
be surprised if we can remove this loop - this sounds like asking for 
trouble.
