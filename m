Yes, both of those, and everything in-between, including for-profit 
businesses that serve mostly hobbyists. Also start-up companies that may 
never be commercially viable (which is most of them).

And don't forget government and non-government organisations, 
not-for-profit organisations, charities, etc.

It ain't necessarily so. I would be surprised if there are no Linux VMs 
running on old corporate mainframes right now. But the age of the hardware 
is largely irrelevant.

If you're a museum interested in cultural artifacts from decades past, or 
if you're a business doing data recovery, you're going to need to operate 
those platforms.

Once removed from mainline Linux, a port becomes basically frozen, and may 
not be compatible with future emulators, which are a moving target. I say 
that because last year I fixed bugs in Linux/m68k that made it incomatible 
with recent QEMU releases (it was only compatible with old QEMU releases).
