Please use:

And I think it was likely my language suggestion to say "stop using", but
probably this should be more friendly. How about "please refactor such
arrays ..."

I'd like to reword this to make an immediate statement about what _should_
be done, and then move into the details on an as accurate as possible
review of the history of these work-arounds. How about this, which I
mixed some of your earlier paragraphs into:



There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use `"flexible array members" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_array_member>`_
for these cases. The older style of one-element or zero-length arrays should
no longer be used.

In older C code, dynamically sized trailing elements were done by specifying
a one-element array at the end of a structure::

        struct something {
                int count;
                struct items[1];
        };

This led to fragile size calculations via sizeof() (which would need to
remove the size of the single trailing element to get a correct size of
the "header"). A `GNU C extension <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Zero-Length.html>`_
was introduced to allow for zero-length arrays, to avoid these kinds of
size problems::

        struct something {
                int count;
                struct items[0];
        };

But this led to other problems, and didn't solve some problems shared by
both styles, like not being to able to detect when such an array is
accidentally being used _not_ at the end of a structure (which could happen
directly, or when such a struct was in unions, structs of structs, etc).

C99 introduced "flexible array members", which lacks a numeric size for
the array declaration entirely::

        struct something {
                int count;
                struct items[];
        };

This is the way the kernel expects dynamically sized trailing elements
to be declared. It allows the compiler to generate errors when the
flexible array does not occur last in the structure, which helps to prevent
some kind of `undefined behavior
<https://git.kernel.org/linus/76497732932f15e7323dc805e8ea8dc11bb587cf>`_
bugs from being inadvertently introduced to the codebase. It also allows
the compiler to correctly analyze array sizes (via sizeof(),
`CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE`, and `CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS`). For instance,
there is no mechanism that warns us that the following application of the
sizeof() operator to a zero-length array always results in zero::

        struct something {
                int count;
                struct items[0];
        };

        struct something *instance;

        instance = kmalloc(struct_size(instance, items, size), GFP_KERNEL);
        instance->length = size;
        memcpy(instance->items, source, size);
        ...
        size = sizeof(instance->items);


[and then continue with the rest of the details you wrote below...]

And for all of these examples, I'd like to avoid using "char" as the type
for the flex array member, since it doesn't drive home the idea of
having a multiplier (i.e. "length" matches the size of "data") And
similarly, "length" should, I think, be called "count". That way the
bytes is separate from count, but is the result of sizeof(*items) *
count.

I don't want to get people confused between "size" (in bytes) vs "count"
(of trailing elements).

How does that look?
