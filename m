True, but one can dream...

Both of those have been the cases recently, it's not just one recent
submission that has had this problem :(

I agree with your goal here, I just don't agree that we should be saying
"some maintainers may insist on exclusive GPL licensing" as no
maintainer should be insisting on this.  They should be pushing back on
the "that is just dumb as it doesn't even do what you think it does!"
patches, like I have been seeing recently.

I do not want to codify the behavior I have seen at times of some
maintainers who refuse to accept anything but GPL-only licensed code.
So try rewording your patch a bit as I think we are in violent agreement
here :)

thanks,
