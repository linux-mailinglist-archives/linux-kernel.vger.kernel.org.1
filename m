Did you figure out the problem here? Karol sees a similar problem on
Tegra210 with the gpu node regulator.

It looks like /external-memory-controller@7001b000 has a duplicate
phandle. Comparing the dtb in the filesystem with what the kernel
gets, that node is added by the bootloader. So the bootloader is
definitely creating a broken dtb.
