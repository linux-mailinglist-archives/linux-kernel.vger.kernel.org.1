What about to have a dedicated sub device for the coredump, with its own
interface (sysfs or char dev)?
Then kernel configs could enable/disable the driver and set the mode.
This could help to decorrelate the coredump and the recovery and manage
different behaviors for debug, production and final product.

Concerning the stm32 platform the usage will depend on customer choice,
as they implement their own remote firmware. So i suppose that the needs would be:
- to enable /disable the coredump depending onproject phases(dev, production,
  final product)
- to perform a post-mortem analysis:
   - remote proc trace
   - code and associated data section analysis

Agree, i would also consider a separate device (but perhaps in a second step). 

One challenge of having a separate device is that we need to ensure that
everything is ready(probed) before starting the firmware especially for the
autoboot mode.
Component bind/unbind mechanism could help to synchronize sub device with
rproc device on start and stop.
FYI, I plan to sent a RFC soon (internal review on going) about the 
de-correlation of the rproc virtio that also introduces the component
bind/unbind mechanism in rproc core.
