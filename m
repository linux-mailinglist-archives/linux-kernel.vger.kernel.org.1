Nicolas had suggested earlier that we could have a way to enable
fw_devlink=on in DT under the "chosen" node. I liked that idea, but
wasn't sure how easy it would be to convince DT maintainers to allow
it. If that happens, we could just set that and not have to worry
about these timeouts for QC platforms.

Not sure how easy it is to update DT in a DB 845c though. But for
cases where DT can't be updated, we'd still have the crappy timeout to
plaster over the issue.

Something like this or whatever sensible name that suggests that the
dependencies in DT are reliable enough to use for probe ordering,
deferred probe, etc. Then once that's there, we can turn on
fw_devlink=on and that'd completely skip this timeout code path (and
has a bunch of other benefits).

chosen {
        linux,reliable-dt-dependencies;
}

Just some food for thought.

Also, Thierry's idea would work, but it'll need changes to multiple
drivers. Also, I don't think it'll work for drivers that'll need to
ignore vs not ignore dependencies based on what board they are used
in. It's still better than the blind timeout though.
