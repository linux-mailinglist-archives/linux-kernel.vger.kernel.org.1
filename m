One other note that I should have mentioned: anything that's buildable
as a module is essentially already testing this path.  Modules are
probed asynchronously and in parallel.  Possibly the solution for my
boot speed woes in this case is to just build this as a module since I
don't see any immediate need why it has to be builtin (so with that
realization I may not actually need this patch).  That being said, it
still seems nice to enable async probe in case someone has a reason to
build this in.

OK, I used function graph to get a trace.  Some of the time is simply
i2c transfers, which we do A LOT of during initialization (and i2c
transfers aren't known for being instant).  However, that's not the
big problem.  Check out the regmap_read_poll_timeout() in
sx9310_init_compensation().  20 ms per sleep with a 2 second timeout.
This seems to eat over around 220 ms of the time on my system.

So how do you want to do this?  Do you want me to re-post the patch
and mention the regmap_read_poll_timeout() in the commit message?  Do
you want to just add that to the commit message yourself?

Thanks!
