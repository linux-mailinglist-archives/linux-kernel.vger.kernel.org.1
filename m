Would you mean the kretprobe handler (or trampoline handler) will be
preempted? All kprobes (including kretprobe) handler is running in
non-preemptive state, so it shouldn't happen...

Ah, you mentioned that the removing the kfree() from the trampline
handler? I think we can make an rcu callback which will kfree() the
given instances. (If it works in NMI)

OK, I'm planning to (1) add a generic trampoline code (2) cleanup per-arch
trampoline to use generic one, (3) rewrite the generic trampoline to use
lockless code. Then it will not break anything.
