I'm not very confident about this approach.  

Kdump usually goes with a minimum initramfs, but for kexec reboot the
normal initramfs generated by distribution could be larger, and there
could be some other cases which can cause troubles.

Another way, maybe one can copy the kernel, dtb, initrd etc with the
very early boot code. And the later kernel code just use the kexec_file_load
function to load them, since they are already in kernel buffers so the
relocations are not necessary.

Current kexec_file_load use 'fd' to load file content, we can have some
interface to load from memory buffers.

Anyway this is just a wild idea.
