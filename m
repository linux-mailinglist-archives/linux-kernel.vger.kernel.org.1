You can do phone calls (with audio) and you can use mobile data, if you
have the patches for that. :) I'm trying to find time to finish up the
drivers needed for that, but I've been a bit short on time lately.

Actually we have come pretty far with MSM8916-based smartphones.
Most functionality is (somewhat) working at this point, the primary
open task is optimizing suspend/power consumption. Battery/charging
and camera is also tricky but works somewhat on some of the devices.

Most of the functionality is packaged in postmarketOS [1] and you can
find a list of the devices in the postmarketOS wiki [2]. Especially
the ones in the "community" category are quite similar in terms of
working functionality.
