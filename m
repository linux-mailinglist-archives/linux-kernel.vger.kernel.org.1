Yes, it was an oversight.

It's there for the same reason why try_to_free_pages() takes a reclaim
argument in the first place: we want to make the thread allocating the
most also do the most reclaim work. Consider a thread allocating THPs
in a loop with another thread allocating regular pages.

Remember that all callers loop. They could theoretically all just ask
for SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX pages over and over again.

The idea is to have fairness in most cases, and avoid allocation
failure, premature OOM, and containment failure in the edge cases that
are caused by the inherent raciness of page reclaim.

How about this:

Reclaim memcg_nr_pages_over_high in the first iteration, then switch
to SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX in the retries.

This acknowledges that while the page allocator and memory.max reclaim
every time an allocation is made, memory.high is currently batched and
can have larger targets. We want the allocating thread to reclaim at
least the batch size, but beyond that only what's necessary to prevent
premature OOM or failing containment.

Add a comment stating as much.

Once we reclaim memory.high synchronously instead of batched, this
exceptional handling is no longer needed and can be deleted again.

Does that sound reasonable?
