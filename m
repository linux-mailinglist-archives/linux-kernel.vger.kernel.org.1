Hi Andrew,

thank you very much for the quick response!

I talked with three currently active OpenWrt core developers and all
were in favor of a unification. I wasn't aware of any previous
discussions nor any pro arguments to keep code names.

I've added Imre via CC so maybe he can share his opinion, too.

Are you okay with adding the new compatible string as first element of
the list? This would already simplify the OpenWrt build system.

What about the changed labels? Are they considered ABI too?

Regarding file names, I'm new to ABI policies. Within OpenWrt this is
all done via a single line patch, I'm not familiar with any other
installers/bootloaders. 

If renaming is a reason not to merge this I'd send a v2 containing only
the the added compatible list and updated labels.

Best,
Paul
