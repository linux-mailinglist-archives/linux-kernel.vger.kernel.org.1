While yes the mmap is created from an evsel fd, they are ultimately
associated with the evlist struct and are per thread or cpu. If
there's more than 1 evsel, then the additional ones are set to the 1st
mmap with PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_OUTPUT. Which I now realize means this
RFC only works for the first evsel. So I guess the API needs to work
something like this:

threads = perf_thread_map__new_dummy();
perf_thread_map__set_pid(threads, 0, 0);

evsel = perf_evsel__new(&attr);
perf_evsel__open(evsel, NULL, threads);

perf_evsel__mmap(evsel);    <--- *new*

perf_evsel__read(evsel, 0, 0, &counts);  // If we have an mmap, then
try a direct read


Perhaps some refactoring of the mmap code in evlist.c will be needed,
but the usage seems pretty orthogonal. I'd propose that mmapping via
perf_evlist__mmap() behavior remain unchanged and direct access is not
supported in that case.
