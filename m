Yes.

So the thing is that hardware MUST NOT speculate stores, or rather, if
it does, it must take extreme measures to ensure they do not become
visible in any way shape or form, since speculative stores lead to
instant OOTA problems.

Therefore we can say that branches order stores and if the branch
condition depends on a load, we get a load->store order. IOW the load
must complete before we can resolve the branch, which in turn enables
the store to become visible/happen.

If we then add an smp_rmb() to the branch to order load->load, we end up
with a load->{load,store} ordering, which is equivalent to a
load-acquire.

The reason to do it like that, is that load-aquire would otherwise
require an smp_mb(), since for many platforms that's the only barrier
that has load->store ordering.

The down-side of doing it like this, as Paul will be quick to point out,
is that the C standard doesn't recognise control dependencies and thus
the compiler would be in its right to 'optimize' our conditional away.

We're relying on the compilers not having done this in the past and
there being sufficient compiler people interested in compiling Linux to
avoid this from happening.


Anyway, this patch is basically:

	LOAD p->state		LOAD-ACQUIRE p->on_rq == 0
	MB
	STORE p->on_rq, 0	STORE p->state, TASK_WAKING

which ensures the TASK_WAKING store happens after the p->state load.
Just a wee bit complicated due to not actually adding any barriers while
adding additional ordering.

Anyway, let me now endeavour to write a coherent Changelog for this mess
:-(
