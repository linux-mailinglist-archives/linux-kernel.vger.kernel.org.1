Good catch. I did test RT, but I just realized the RT test ran after it
enabled uclamp again. So I missed the case when it wasn't enabled.

Not sure if this is the best way forward. I need to think about it.
While I am not keen on enabling in kernel users of util clamp, but there was
already an attempt to do so. This approach will not allow us to implement
something in the future for that. Which maybe is what we want..

This has already come up with another thread [1]. I think in-kernel users
shouldn't go through this path. I will propose something to give stronger
guarantees in this regard.

What sort of surprises are you thinking of?

Thanks
