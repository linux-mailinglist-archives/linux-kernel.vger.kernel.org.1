No one seems particularly interested in my suggestion that the RSP exposed t=
o the enclave be different from the actual untrusted stack. Oh well.

That being said, if I were writing a Rust wrapper for SGX (or Python or any l=
anguage with a reasonable form of async/await), I would want the vDSO code t=
o support swapping RSP before ENCLU because I would want to have first-class=
 support for invoking an enclave from an async function and suspending insid=
e the handler. Allocating a real stack (and shadow stack once CET shows up) f=
or this is disgusting.  If the vDSO supported this natively, it could (in pr=
inciple) interact with signal delivery such that signals would not see the a=
lternative stack.

I do admit that the implementation would not be pretty. Honestly, I think In=
tel messed up by exposing USER_RSP to enclaves in the first place.

I find this justification a bit silly. Binutils asm (gas) doesn=E2=80=99t su=
pport offsetof for C structs either, and Linux works just fine. We=E2=80=99r=
e talking about hardcoding one number along with an assertion somewhere that=
 the number is correct, right?  Couldn=E2=80=99t sizeof be used, too?

To be clear, I think that passing around a misc pointer seems entirely reaso=
nable, but I see it as a nice feature, not as a requirement for correct usag=
e of the function.=
