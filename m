Sorry I does not notice that mt7623a and mt7623n are different SoC.
Because they are different SoC, I think the first step is to upstream
mt7623a.dtsi and mt7623n.dtsi independently. That means in each dtsi,
it include all devices of its SoC. After both dtsi is upsteamed, we
could find out what is the common part, then we create a common dtsi
these two SoC, for example mt7623a_mt7623n_common.dtsi. (Maybe there
is a SoC's name is exactly 'mt7623', so I prefer mt7623.dtsi is
reserved for that SoC, and mt7623_common.dtsi is not preferred because
I don't know there are how many mt7623 family SoC and
mt7623_common.dtsi should be use for all mt7623 family)

Chun-Kuang.
