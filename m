Please see the patch included below. As you suggested, it removes the code that does the OC power down on card readers
that are not members of your A series. The patch is against a fresh pull of Linus's tree this morning
(v5.8-2768-g4da9f3302615).

I've tested the resultant kernel on my Intel NUC6CAYH box (which contains an NUC66AYB board) and the rts5229 works fine.
I've also tested it on my laptop which also has a card reader supported by the rtsx_pci driver (an RTL8411B) and that
also works fine.

As I mentioned yesterday, I think it's a candidate for the 5.4 ans 5.7 stable series.

Thanks for your patience!

Chris
