The EFI memory map exposes more information than the E820 one, and
this extra information should remain private to Xen if at all
possible. I actually think that exposing the raw E820 map was a
layering violation, too. Instead hypercalls should have been added
for the specific legitimate uses that Dom0 may have for the memmap.
