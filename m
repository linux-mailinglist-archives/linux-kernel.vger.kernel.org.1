That's good news. :)

I'm fine with that. Maybe you can push the MTK version and I can send
a small patch after that to add the small bits I need?

I think Marc's comments on my series apply to your driver and I think
maybe answer some of the questions you had. For example what
to do about the read-modify-write sequence for updating the registers.

I have a very messy tree with support for the SPI NOR controller, SPI, i2c etc
that were used in MStar chips. If any of those are shared it'd be great to know.
