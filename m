This is not the case for AArch64. There, __GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE__ is
always emitted, along with the magic .got.plt entries, regardless of
the input.

As for the input objects - why is '#pragma GCC visibility(hidden)' not
the default for -ffreestanding builds? This suppresses any GOT entries
emitted by the compiler, but the only way to get this behavior is
through the #pragma, which is how we ended up with '-include hidden.h'
in a couple of places.

IOW, if the toolchain behavior was not 100% geared towards shared
executables as it is today, we would not need the hacks that we need
to apply to get a relocatable bare metal binary like we need for the
KASLR kernel.

You mean 'ld -static -pie' right? That seems to work. Is that a recent
invention?
