> The identifiers in an enumerator list are declared as constants that have type int and may appear wherever such are permitted.127) An enumerator with = defines its enumeration constant as the value of the constant expression. If the first enumerator has no =, the value of its enumeration constant is 0. Each subsequent enumerator with no = defines its enumeration constant as the value of the constant expression obtained by adding 1 to the value of the previous enumeration constant. (The use of enumerators with = may produce enumeration constants with values that duplicate other values in the same enumeration.) The enumerators of an enumeration are also known as its members.

The kernel developer community has "strong feelings" for this, please be
specific and list the values when they matter.
