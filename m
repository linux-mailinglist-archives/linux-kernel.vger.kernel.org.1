Understood.  But not all hardirq handlers are threaded.

I already gave you my views on raw_call_rcu().  :-/

On the contrary, it has everything to do with this.  It is the environment
in which we cannot use preemptible() to dynamically determine whether
or not it is safe to invoke the memory allocator.

Except that lockdep still yells at us for CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y, and
again, in the CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y we cannot use preemptible() to
dynamically determine whether it is safe to invoke the memory allocator.

Until people start propagating them all over because they happen to
unconditionally stop lockdep from complaining.

Sorry, but no.  The call_rcu() callback invocation currently takes
a cache miss on each step through the rcu_head chain.

Except that we also need to run non-RT kernels.
