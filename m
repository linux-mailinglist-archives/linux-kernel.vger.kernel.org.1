That is a great demand, but please stop talking of companies here,
because companies simply don't matter for Linux development.  People
and use cases do, companies don't and your mail talking about companies
really can't be taken serious.

And I'm not sure why you think Linux is different from any other NVMe
host OS.  If random NVMe host A decided they need feature X they are
going to require it, because why not.  Especially if the developers of
host A helped to drive the development of feature X.  I'm pretty sure
with a little background in storage standards you've seen that play out
a lot before.  And it is no different here.
