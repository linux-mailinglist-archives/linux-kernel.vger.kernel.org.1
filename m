I'll assume this is easier to get fixed up when applying the patch,
but happy to send a v2 if requested.

I've tested it locally but not much more than that.  As far as I can
tell it doesn't break anything or fix anything but still seems like a
good change to make.  ;-)

Generally Chrome OS tries to work with an "upstream first" philosophy.
That has lots of benefits, but one downside is it means that patches
get sent upstream before they've actually landed anywhere.  That being
said, even if we landed this today we'd get limited testing because of
the Chrome OS kernel trees only the Chrome OS 5.4 tree uses the
upstream driver for Cr50 (the one SPI-connected security chip that
Chromebooks use).  Cr50 originally did not get developed as "upstream
first", so all the old codebases have the old downstream driver.  This
problem doesn't affect the old downstream driver which had its own
"struct spi_transfer".  If anything it makes the upstream code behave
more like the old downstream driver.  If you want to see the old
downstream driver:

https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/chromeos-=
4.19/drivers/char/tpm/cr50_spi.c#172


Another note is that I don't have access to any SPI-connected chips
that are _not_ Cr50.  That means that half of this change is totally
untested but looks sane.  If anyone can test it that'd be great.  :-)
