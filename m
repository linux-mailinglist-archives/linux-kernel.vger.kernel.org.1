I get your point about n3000, but that card is not currently supported in the public. Currently there is really only pac10, the 0x9c4 device.  Once n3000 (and d5005) is out, it will have several sub devices that will also so need to be manually configured.  While a developer of the n3000 will know which subdevices are needed, someone just building the kernel will not.  So would expect there to be something like

CONFIG_FPGA_DFL_N3000

select CONFIG_DFL_PCI

select CONFIG_DFL_SUBDEV_1

..

On PF vs FP, yes only afu parts are needed.  But i doubt anyone builds a VF specific kernel. And if folks wanted to not use the fme parts they would not have to load it's module at run time.

I would like a top level config what auto selects all of the submodules needed based on the card. I think maybe that is CONFIG_FPGA_DFL_PAC10. so we will be ready for CONFIG_FPGA_DFL_N3000 and CONFIG_FPGA_DFL_D5005 and what ever comes later.
