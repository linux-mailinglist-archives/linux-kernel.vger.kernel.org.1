Nit: variables named "*ndx" usually hold an actual index value. If it's 
just a flag then maybe name it something like "use_bypass_context"?

Oh, so maybe the name is in fact OK but the type is wrong :/

I guess this does happens to work out, but for the wrong reason...

Note that if we are talking indices here then 0 would be perfectly valid 
in general. This works out OK in practice given that we're always 
reserving the last implemented context above, and if we ever *did* only 
have one such that index 0 is the last then we're going to have a bad 
time either way, but it's not necessarily the most obvious.

Ha, that's brilliant :)

Does any of your hardware actually have EXIDS implemented? No big deal 
if you only want this here "just in case", I'm just curious as I was 
under then impression that it was essentially a ThunderX special.

Other than sorting out bypass_cbndx one way or the other, overall this 
is now looking about as nice as it ever could - thanks for persevering!
