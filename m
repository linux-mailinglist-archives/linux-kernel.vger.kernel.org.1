It's helping with a lower bound, not an upper bound, and it's the upper
bound that's the problem.

On larger server systems boot can take a surprisingly long time, and
it's possible that someone might do something like put modules on
encrypted storage and need the user to authenticate before they can
load.  There were concerns that the existing 30 second timeout is not
long enough, though the systems where there's fragilities are mainly
laptops which boot much more quickly.  I'm also worrying that there may
be cases where our current behaviour is helping the system run,
especially in warm boot situations where the hardware may not have been
entirely reset.  Such systems are a bit fragile obviously but so's your
proposal.

You can't assume server type hardware runs ACPI, there are some very big
semi-embedded systems for applications like telephony switches or larger
medical devices that look like a server with a bunch of specialist
hardware bolted on the side.

If you're trying to bodge this by adding an extra consumer that won't
work since the current requirements from consumers are additive.

A device that's in multiple frameworks is probably a MFD, especially the
regulator portion.

The requirement for modules has always been there, that's what causes
problems for most of the things people propose.  Like I said above I
don't think fwlink helps for the cases that cause problems, it can only
confirm that nothing will ever load without an overlay, it can't tell us
if anything is actually going to appear.

This is overly pessimistic, we can do a lot better than we currently do
especially when things are built as modules.

These really only apply to trying to do things with initcall ordering,
and even there there's room for improvement - if we were going to try to
do things in some sort of dependency directed order we could just defer
actually binding anything until much later on in init, there's no *need*
to do immediate binds.  Similarly for async probing, the dependency
information could be used there.  With module loading userspace gets to
pick what order it does things in, especially with the initial coldplug
step, so it should be easier still to look at what's a priority and what
the dependencies are and optimize the ordering.

Sure.
