That's an interesting point, but I think we should improve this for the simple
use case without namespaces first just to improve the user experience, so I've
sent v2 of the patch with the change you suggested about using "default y".

One other thing that is an issue that I'd like to ask about is this line in
arm_spe_pmu.c:

	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PID_IN_CONTEXTIDR) && perfmon_capable())
		reg |= BIT(SYS_PMSCR_EL1_CX_SHIFT);

This means that the user has to be root to get the context saved with SPE.
Is this a necessary security feature? I thought that PIDs are viewable by
all users anyway? Do you think there is any way we could remove the perfmon_capable()
requirement?
