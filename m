I am trying to say that KERN_NO_CONSOLES resembles more a policy than a
priority. Because I as a developer have no idea whether the message is
good enough for console or not.

I believe we are free to change kernel log levels as we find a fit. I
was not aware that KERN_DEBUG messages are automatically filtered out.
Even if this is the case then this doesn't really disallow admins to
allow KERN_DEBUG into log files. Dump of the oom eligible tasks is
arguably a debugging output anyway. So I disagree with your statement.

I am not really familiar with all the possibilities admins have when
setting filtering for different consoles but KERN_NO_CONSOLES sounds
rather alien to the existing priority based approach. You can fine tune
priorities and that is all right because they should be reflecting
importance. But global no-consoles doesn't really fit in here because
each console might require a different policy but the marking is
unconditional and largely unaware of existing consoles.
