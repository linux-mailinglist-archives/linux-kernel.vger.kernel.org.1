I did object when this was proposed and I've objected for the last two
years, because we keep adding more and more subsystems to follow this
broken behavior.

I can't argue with that and I'm at loss on how to turn this around.

I don't agree with this, upstream should be functional in its default
configuration. Out-of-tree patches might be necessary to enable features
or get the most out of the hardware, but what we have upstream should
work.  And no, this is not always the case, but we should at least aim
for this.

I'll take a look at that, but to repeat what I've said many times
before, for Qualcomm platforms there's pretty much no such thing as
optional links.
