I can see that also from the code, but it doesn't explain why.

And I'm not sure this is correct. I can see two problems with it.

After your patch series, there is still one difference between anon
and file: cache trim mode. If the "use-once" anon dominate most of
memory and you have a small set of heavily thrashing files, it would
not get recognized. File refaults *have* to compare their distance to
the *entire* anon set, or we could get trapped in cache trimming mode
even as file pages with access frequencies <= RAM are thrashing.

On the anon side, there is no cache trimming mode. But even if we're
not in cache trimming mode and active file is already being reclaimed,
we have to recognize thrashing on the anon side when reuse frequencies
are within available RAM. Otherwise we treat an inactive file that is
not being reused as having the same value as an anon page that is
being reused. And then we may reclaim file and anon at the same rate
even as anon is thrashing and file is not. That's not right.

We need to activate everything with a reuse frequency <= RAM. Reuse
frequency is refault distance plus size of the inactive list the page
was on. This means anon distances should be compared to active anon +
inactive file + active file, and file distances should be compared to
active file + inactive_anon + active anon.

workingset_size should basically always be everything except the
inactive list the page is refaulting from as that represents the delta
between total RAM and the amount of space this page had available.
