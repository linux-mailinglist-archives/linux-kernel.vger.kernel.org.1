None of the people that replied have any real use of the sun4m port,
they only wanted it to stay because they had some machines or such.
In other words - people will be sad if we sunset sun4m, but it will not
hurt anyone as there are no users left.

I will include the above summary when I post v2 of the patch to sunset
sun4m and sun4d. Then we will see what we conclude in the end.

Right now in am in demolition mode as I have a new house that requires a
total refactoring. So linux stuff is lower on the priority list so v2
will wait until I have time to do any necessary follow-up.
