Generally I would expect this global tunable to be part of a vendor's SoC BSP.

People tend to think of the flagship SoCs which are powerful, but if you
consider the low and medium end devices there's a massive spectrum over there
that this range is trying to cover.

I would expect older boards init script to be separate for newer boards init
script. The OS by default boosts all RT tasks unless a platform specific script
overrides that. So I can't see how an OS upgrade would affect older boards.

This knob still allows you to disable the max boosting and use the per-task
uclamp interface to boost only those tasks you care about. AFAIK this is
already done in a hacky way in android devices via special vendors provisions.

If that's what your use case requires, you can certainly treat it like
a boolean if you want.

per-task uclamp interface allows you to do that. But SoC vendors/system
integrators need to decide that. I'm saying this with Android in mind
specifically. Linux based laptops that are tuned in similar way are rare. But
hopefully this will change at some point :)

You need to use SCHED_DEADLINE then :)

Making sure that RT tasks meet their deadlines is a userspace tuning problem.
There's no way the kernel can know if an RT task is meeting its deadline.

To cover all possible systems Linux can run on, this variability is required.
On general purpose systems with decent SoCs, I'd expect them to just want to
set this to 0 and selectively boost specific RT tasks.

I guess you're talking about Android/Chromium specific knobs on top of the
sysctl one here. Not sure why you need that since init scripts should be able
to modify this directly since they run as root.
