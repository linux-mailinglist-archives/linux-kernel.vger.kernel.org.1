I don't see how it could lock up in write_cr3(), at least on bare-metal.
What is the environment this happens, 32 or 64 bit, in a VM or
bare-metal?

I think it is more likely that your lockup is actually a page-fault
loop, where the #PF handler does not map the faulting address correctly.

But I have to look closer into how text_poke() works before I can say
more.

Btw, in case it happens on x86-64, does it also happen without
vmalloc-stacks?

Regards,

	Joerg
