I hoped so too, but we can't know the moment when all processes that were in the
critical part of freeing pages to pcplists have moved on (they might have been
rescheduled).
We could change free_unref_page() to disable IRQs sooner, before
free_unref_page_prepare(), or at least the get_pfnblock_migratetype() part. Then
after the single drain, we should be safe, AFAICS?
RT guys might not be happy though, but it's much simpler than this patch. I
still like some of the cleanups in 1-4 though tbh :)
