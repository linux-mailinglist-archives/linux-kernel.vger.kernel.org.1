Sorry for late reply. I think I mixup the serial nand support and 
QPIC_V2.0 support.
Only patches [2/5] mtd: rawnand: qcom: Add initial support for qspi nand
and [5/5] mtd: rawnand: qcom: Add support for serial training. are for 
serial
nand. Other patches [3/5] mtd: rawnand: qcom: Read QPIC version &
[4/5] mtd: rawnand: qcom: Enable support for erase,read & write for 
serial nand.
are to support QPIC_V2.0. In QPIC_V2.0 onwards some additional registers 
and features
got added. QPIC_NAND_READ_LOCATION_LAST_CW_n register got added to read 
last code word.
Page scope read & multi page read feature got added to read single and 
multiple
pages. QPIC_NAND_AUTO_STATUS_EN register got added to read status in 
page scope read
& multi page read etc.

I will take out QPIC_V2.0 support patches and will push it separately.
For serial nand support few lines of codes are there around 50 lines
to initalize QPIC serial block and serial training code. So can I put 
this
this as a separate file inside drivers/mtd/nand/raw/qpic_serial_nand.c. 
Would it be ok ?
Because there is no dedicated spi controller for serial nand. QPIC 
controller having
one serial interface block to deal with serial nand device.
