I saw this case during FVP testing, although I acknowledge the 'virtual'
part of that platform [1]. But allowing this does enable AMU testing on
an AEM FVP.

While I completely understand the reasoning behind avoiding to introduce
large changes for small corner-case gains, the arguments for this
support was:
 - (1) AMUs are a new feature and it will take some time until we see the
   real usecases. That's always the case with early support for a
   feature - we want to add it early to enable its use and testing, but
   it will take some time to establish the true usecases.
 - (2) It literally needed 2 lines of code + the weak cpufreq function
   to support this.

Given that I can't guarantee what hardware will or won't do, and given
that AMUs are an optional feature, I controlled the only thing I could:
the software :). By not making assumptions about the hardware, I ensured
that the code does not break the interaction between cpufreq use or AMU
use for frequency invariance.

This will be nicer in the new code as the control will be at CPU level,
rather than policy level.
