Yes I understood that part, but here we were trying to
fix the NULL pointer dereference right and hence the
question as to why we need to check for kernel events?
I am no expert in perf but I don't see anywhere in the
kernel checking for is_kernel_event(), so I am a bit
skeptical if exporting that is actually right or not.
