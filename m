You've lost me.  (A) What is IOMMU grouping?  (B) How does it prevent 
users from opening devices?  (C) What do users have to do with the 
problem anyway (USB host controllers and drivers have to do things on 
their own even without user intervention)?

Until now that hasn't been necessary, since nobody wanted to bind a 
different driver to these devices.

Until recently that has been a valid assumption.

It's worse than that.  We're not just dealing with a software 
interaction issue -- the _hardware_ for these devices also interacts.  
That's the real reason why the driver for the device on one slot has to 
be aware of the driver for the device on a different slot.

Adding a mechanism for software registration or validation won't fix the 
hardware issues.  Relying on a protocol that requires all the devices to 
be unbound before any of them are bound to a new class of drivers, on 
the other hand, will fix the problem.
