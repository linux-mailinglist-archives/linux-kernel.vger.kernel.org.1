Yea! Thanks again for these test runs. I really don't like posting
patches that I can't run-time test, but this CI system mitigates
that pretty well.

I do think it's worth following up on. And it seems like it would be
very easy to repro: just hack in a forced failure at the call site of
pin_user_pages_fast_only(), and follow the breadcrumbs.

Thanks for the review! And if lifting that check up higher in the call
stack is desired, I'm all in favor of that being done...in a separate
patch. :)

I'm trying to keep a very light touch when converting these call sites.
