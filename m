Ok, that is, i don't need to modify the doc in kernel, just create a pull request in github [1]?

I did like this in my previous version, such as v5. After discussed with James, i modified it to the current way.

We think the existing behavior should be unchanged, which helps with keeping compatibility with existing
user-space and older kdump kernels.

The comments from James:
> linux,usable-memory-range = <BASE1 SIZE1 [BASE2 SIZE2]>.
Won't this break if your kdump kernel doesn't know what the extra parameters are?
Or if it expects two ranges, but only gets one? These DT properties should be treated as
ABI between kernel versions, we can't really change it like this.

I think the 'low' region is an optional-extra, that is never mapped by the first kernel. I
think the simplest thing to do is to add an 'linux,low-memory-range' that we
memblock_add() after memblock_cap_memory_range() has been called.
If its missing, or the new kernel doesn't know what its for, everything keeps working.
