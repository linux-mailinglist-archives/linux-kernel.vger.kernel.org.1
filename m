My concern is about do not break the perf kvm usages and Yao did it in v3.

Tested-by: Like Xu <like.xu@linux.intel.com>

Do we really need to support sample guests without using perf kvm?

If it's true, I would prefer "cycles:uG" to cover guest user space
events only, "cycles:kG" to cover guest kernel space events only,
and only host events are sampled without the ":G" modifier by default.

I am not sure if ":G" has been used in perf.

At the very least, this v3 patch may not
block the follow-up patch from Yao (if any).

Thanks,
Like Xu
