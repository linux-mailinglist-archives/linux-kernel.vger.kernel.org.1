By default all replicators have the IDFILTER registers set to 0 out of
hardware reset. This ensures that programmable replicators behave in
the same way as non-programmable replicators out of reset.

The  dynamic_replicator_reset() is of course a driver state reset -
which filters out all trace on the output ports. The trace is then
enabled when we set the trace path from source to sink.

It seems to me that you have 2 problems that need solving here:

1) Why does the reset_replicator() called from probe() _not_ work
correctly on replicator 1? It seems to work later if you introduce a
reset after more of the system has powered and booted. This is
startiing to look a little like a PM / clocking issue.

This failure is causing the state when we are trying to set an output
port that both branches of this replicator are enabled for output.
In effect for this replicator, setting the output port has no effect
as it is already enabled.

2) Why does having both ports of this repilicator enabled cause a hard
lockup? This is a separate hardware  / system issue.

The worst that should happen if both branches of a replicator are
enabled is that you get undesirable back pressure. (e.g. there is a
system we have seen - I think it is Juno - where there is a static
replicator feeding the TPIU and ETR - we need to disable the TPIU to
prevent undesired back pressure).

Mike
