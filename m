That sounds good. Presumably raw_copy_from_user will be smart enough
to optimize aligned 2 byte accesses for flags above?

>  BTW, how large is the structure and how is it aligned?

It's a batch of 16 byte structures, aligned to 16 bytes.
At the moment I used batch size of 64 which seems enough.
Ideally we'd actually read the whole batch like this
without stac/clac back and forth. E.g.

	struct vring_desc adesc[64] = {};

	stac()
	for (i = 0; i < 64; ++i) {
	 get_user(flags, desc[i].flags)
	 smp_rmb()
	 if (!(flags & VALID))
		break;
	 copy_from_user(&adesc[i], desc + i, sizeof adesc[i]);
	}
	clac()

Thanks, that does sound useful!

I agree, that does sound like a good cleanup.

It can be zeroed at any point.
We just try to call __vhost_vq_meta_reset whenever anything can go
stale.
