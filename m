[Correction] T30 has same drive strengths to use irrespective of signal=20
voltage and it doesn't have pad control. So for T3- we can update device=20
tree to specify "default" pinctrl with drvup/dn settings.

Regarding warnings, I guess simpler and easy fix is to remove warning=20
message on missing 3v3/1v8 drive strengths as pinctrl/dt properties were=20
already added for T210/186/194 where we need and old device tree don't=20
have them but the case where auto cal can fail is very rare.

Otherwise should update driver to allow=20
tegra_sdhci_parse_pad_autocal_dt() only when NVQUIRK_HAS_PADCALIB is set=20
and also within tegra_sdhci_parse_pad_autocal_dt() show warning of=20
missing 3v3/1v8 settings only when NVQUIRK_NEEDS_PAD_CONTROL is set.

Thierry, please suggest if you prefer to removing warnings or fix driver=20
to show warning based on PADCALIB and PAD_CONTROL quirks.
