So there's indeed a bit of an argument about when it should just be
stitched together as components, and when it is better a bridge. But
bridges also come with plenty of convenience glue, and we're talking
about fpga so the point pretty much is to rewire this all eventually.
Maybe not by you folks, but people are r/e-ing these things so who
knows.

The other thing is you do have a bridge attached already, or should
have: The drm_panel. And you do get the entire drm-connector
instantiation rather wrong, at least the ->dpms hook is breaking
atomic real bad. The ->detect implementation is also quite the
adventure. So panel bridge is definitely required here.

Finally this also would avoid component.c usage in xlnx - not that
there's something wrong with that per se, but it always means driver
specific logic and interactions, so harder to maintain for people not
involved in the code base on a daily basis. Also I'm not sure how this
works, the component integration glue in the main driver seems to be
missing. And the upstream drm/xlnx doesn't seem to have it either.

So all together I do think drm_bridge sounds like the right thing to do her=
