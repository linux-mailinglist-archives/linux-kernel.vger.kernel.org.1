*Normally* but not always - some of the older bindings do love their
arrays of phandles (or mixes of numbers and phandles!) unfortunately.

Not really, one of the big targets is people doing system integration
who are writing a DT or possibly producing a highly tuned kernel config.
They needn't have a strong familiarity with the driver, they're often
just picking it up off the shelf.

The push for this is that there's already people going around modifying
drivers whatever happens but at present they're mainly trying to delete
diagnostics which isn't wonderful.  Besides, even if we push things into
the subsystems they'd want to use this interface or something quite like
it anyway - it's more a question of if we go quickly add some users to
subsystems isn't it?  I'm not against that.
