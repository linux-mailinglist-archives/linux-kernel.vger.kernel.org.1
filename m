I absolutely hate it when I see this.

I much rather have the documentation next to the code. Because
honestly, I trust that comments next to the code will get updated if
the code changes much more likely than comments buried in the
Documentation directory.

It's also more likely that I wont even bother looking at the doc
(because I wont trust it to be up to date) and just read the code and
try to figure it out. Or look at how others have used it.
