The proposal was not accepted because there were more requirements:

   + add console device into sysfs so that it can be modified there
   + make a reasonable backward compatible behavior

I guess that the sysfs interface discouraged the author to continue
on it.

Note that console loglevel handling is very complicated. There are
already four variables, see console_printk array in
kernel/printk/printk.c. Per console loglevel would make it even
more complicated.

It is a nighmare. And introducing max_reason parameter goes the same way.

I see. Just to be sure. Is the main reason to add max_reason parameter
to keep complatibility of the deprecated dump_oops parameter? Or is
there any real use case for this granularity?

I made some arecheology. ramoops.dump_oops parameter was added in 2010 by the
initial commit 56d611a04fb2db77334e ("char drivers: RAM oops/panic
logger."

Note that the initial implementation printed Oops reason only when
dump_oops was set. It printed all other reasons otherwise. It seems
that there were only the two reasons at that time.

Now, printk.always_kmsg_dump parameter was added later in 2012 by
the commit c22ab332902333f8376601 ("kmsg_dump: don't run on non-error
paths by default").

IMHO, the later commit actually fixed the default behavior of ramoops.

I wonder if anyone is actually using the ramoops.dump_oops parameter
in reality. I would personally make it deprecated and change the
default behavior to work according to printk.always_kmsg_dump parameter.

IMHO, ramoops.dump_oops just increases complexity and should not have
been introduced at all. I would try hard to avoid introducing even bigger
complecity and mess.

I know that there is the "do not break existing userspace" rule. The
question is if there is any user and if it is worth it.

It looks too complicated. I would really try hard to avoid the
parameter at all.
