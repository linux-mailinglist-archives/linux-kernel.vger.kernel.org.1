As I mentioned to Mark's response, it is mostly the current arm32
configuration. We enable SMCCC for armv7 and of course we don't mandate
PSCI for them. I assumed depending on PSCI for all uses of SMCCC even
if it is not remotely connected to PSCI was wrong. But if that is fine,
then we don't have any issue ðŸ˜„
