Well, the media patches were indeed based at the media upstream tree.
As I maintain the media tree, and the changes for it are huge, I opted
to merge from media before applying this series. Btw, the series
is also after the other fix patches for the warnings with Sphinx 2.x 
that I sent previously. It might eventually conflict with the Sphinx 3.x
patch series.

At the current version, there are 101 patches against next-20201002, being
about half of them fixing all doc warnings on Sphinx 2.x, and the other 
ones fixing almost all Sphinx 3.x warnings.

The latest version at:

	https://git.linuxtv.org/mchehab/experimental.git/log/?h=sphinx3-fixes-v4

In the specific case of fscript.rst, there are only two patches on my
series affecting it, both as part of this /52 series:

	$ git log next-20200922..devel/sphinx3-fixes-v4 Documentation/filesystems/fscrypt.rst

	    docs: fs: fscrypt.rst: get rid of :c:type: tags
    
	    The :c:type: tag has problems with Sphinx 3.x, as structs
	    there should be declared with c:struct.
    
	    So, remove them, relying at automarkup.py extension to
	    convert them into cross-references.

	    docs: get rid of :c:type explicit declarations for structs
    
	    The :c:type:`foo` only works properly with structs before
	    Sphinx 3.x.
    
	    On Sphinx 3.x, structs should now be declared using the
	    .. c:struct, and referenced via :c:struct tag.
    
	    As we now have the automarkup.py macro, that automatically
	    convert:
        	    struct foo
    
	    into cross-references, let's get rid of that, solving
	    several warnings when building docs with Sphinx 3.x.

Anyway, I'm waiting for the today's next, in order to do another
rebase, fixing any new warning that might be added, and to post the
patches that weren't merged yet via other trees.

The end goal is to have zero warnings with Sphinx 2.x, and the minimal
number of warnings with 3.x (right now, there's just 6 warnings
with 3.x - fixing those require fixes at Sphinx C domain parser).

Thanks,
Mauro
