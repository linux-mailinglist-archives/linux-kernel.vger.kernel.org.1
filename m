Why I want to know the lru_lock protection here is that currently we have 5 lru lists
but only guarded by one lock, that would cause much contention when different apps
active on a server.

I guess originally we have only one lru_lock, since 5 locks would cause cacheline bouncing
if we put them together, or a bit cacheline waste to separate them in cacheline. But
after we have qspinlock, each of cpu will just loop lock on their cacheline, no interfer 
to others. It would much much relief the performance drop by cacheline bounce.

And we could use page.mapping bits to store the using lru list index for the page.
As a quick thought, I guess, except the 5 locks for 5 lists, we still need 1 more lock for
common lruvec data or for others which relay on lru_lock now, like mlock, hpage_nr_pages..
That's the reason I want to know everything under lru_lock. :)

Any comments for this idea? :)

Thanks
Alex

Thanks a lot for the info, Johannes&Joonsoo! A long history for a interesting idea. :)
