:)

To be clear, I think we should give the storm detection a go. Especially
given the problems which James has seen with polling on some TPMs.

But if that turns out to not be feasible I agree we should just either
disable IRQs by default on standard x86 platforms, or just remove the
IRQ support all together.

Hans
