Ah, yes, there it was introduced.

That fixed only the case of a single-threaded process doing execve,
but missed to fix the case of a multi-threaded process doing execve,
and the other threads racing with the execve.  That is what happened
on my laptop, again and again, when I tried to fix a bug in the
gcc testsuite, that is while I wanted to track down another bug,
that is why the gcc testsuite left loads of temp-files in /tmp,
until I decided to go on a little bug-hunt in the linux kernel
instead :-/

And I had no idea what was happening at all.  But that way this bug
bit me again and again, until I realized the nature of the strace
problem, when I was really baffled.

Before I considered a linux patch for that I tried to fix it in the
strace code instead, and in fact I had tried two approaches,
one is wait in a signal handler, that did not work.
The second one is use another thread that does the wait, and that
did only work when I disable the PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT flags.

I posted the two patches on lkml, just for reference.
Maybe you are amused by those patches. I consider that a craziness myself,
but it was indeed able to avoid the deadlock, with a user space change alone:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/AM6PR03MB5170D68B5010FCA627A603F8E4E60@AM6PR03MB5170.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com/


so that is more or less for your amusement, sincerely I would not propose
that as the way to fix the strace deadlock.
