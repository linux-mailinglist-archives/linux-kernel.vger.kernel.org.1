Funny enough, I think most hardware vendors are actually correct with
the CONSTANT implementation but Microsoft itself with the Surface
touchpad line :)

I'll need to check whether we have too many drivers that replace
constant by variable. But I know it bit us in the past a few times
(and the Surface covers are the ones I remember). But again, Windows
is weird in a lot of ways, and I believe that they do not have one
unified driver for everything, but some behaviour that depends on the
application. So I am a little bit hesitant to toggle the switch to
consider constant usages as variable ones. Luckily, we now have a
regression test suite. It's not complete, but it can prevent such
regressions with the devices we have in there.

Cheers,
Benjamin
