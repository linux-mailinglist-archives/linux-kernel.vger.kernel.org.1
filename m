I know that the "iommus" property is not about inheriting stream 
mapping. Probing the iommu removes the stream mapping created by the 
bootloader, the iommus property is added so that new mappings are 
created to replace what was removed.

You seem to be under the impression that the SM8150/SM8250 bootloader 
does not configure SMMU. It does, for both UFS and SDHC, just like it 
does for display/splash screen on some devices.

With either value of ARM_SMMU_DISABLE_BYPASS_BY_DEFAULT, it will not 
work without the iommus property.
