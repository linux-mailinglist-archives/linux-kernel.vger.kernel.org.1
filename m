An important part of my patch is the handling of power management.
Specifically:
* If the GPIO is an input we don't need to keep the device powered,
just power it temporarily to read the pin.
* If the GPIO is an output we do need to keep the device powered.

I suppose that could be common for other similar devices so as long as
the generic interfaces can handle this concept we can try to use it.

It's because I needed GPIOF_DIR_OUT / GPIOF_DIR_IN which was
apparently wrong.  See below.

Doing so requires adding a lock to this driver to handle concurrent
users of the different GPIOs.  I can go back and do that but I'd
rather not.

Some prior discussion:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAD=FV=WJONhm4ukwZa2vGtozrz_SmLuTCLxVimnGba7wRPPzgQ@mail.gmail.com

...if you want me to change this to a u8 + a mutex then please let me
know, otherwise I'll assume keeping it a bitmap is fine.

I guess I'm used to interfaces that don't have a data pointer.  I'll
change it to gpiochip_get_data() at your suggestion, though (I think)
it might be slightly less efficient (a function call and a pointer
dereference compared to a subtract operation).

That's what I get for reading the comments.  I'll change this in the
next version.  I've also sent the following patch to help keep other
people from falling into my trap:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200428172322.1.I396f351e364f3c09df7c7606e79abefb8682c092@changeid/

Somehow I think of "!!" as being a bool and this function as returning
something that's logically an int.  It really doesn't matter a whole
lot and I'm happy to change it, so I'll change it in the next version.

I think that (for now) this comment is a no-op since the generic
helper library isn't landed yet, right?  ...and it wouldn't handle the
power management I need?  If I'm confused and I need to act on this
comment, please let me know.

Sure, I can add #define SN_GPIO_MUX_MASK 0x3.  Basically the mux is:

* 0: input
* 1: output
* 2: special function

As talked about in the patch comments, I don't define this as an
official pinmux driver because that seems overkill.  I'll assume it's
OK to just do the #define and use it.  If you want something more, let
me know.

Thank you very much for the review!  I'll plan to send a new patch out
in the next day or two with minor comments addressed and making the
assumptions I've documented above.  If I got something wrong then
please yell.  ...or yell after I send the next version and I'll send
yet another version after that!  :-)
