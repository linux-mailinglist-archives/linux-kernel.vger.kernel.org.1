Sadly no. 'noinstr' implies 'notrace', but also places the function in
the .noinstr.text section for the purpose of objtool checking. But: we
should only mark a function 'noinstr' if it (and its callees)
satisfies the requirements that Peter outlined (are the requirements
documented somewhere?). In particular, we need to worry about vmalloc
faults.

Now I am a bit worried that, even though we're lucky today, with what
Andrey said about e.g. kcov_remote faults, it'll be hard to ensure we
won't break in future. The exact set of conditions that mean we're
lucky today may change and we have no way of checking this.

I'll try to roll a v2 based on the "if (_RET_IP_ in noinstr section)
return;" and whitelist in objtool approach. Unless you see something
very wrong with that. And I do hope we'll get compiler attributes
eventually.

Thanks,
