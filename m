Sorry. By "device" I meant the board/phone/system.

So when folks change an existing board/system's DT, that can cause
userland breakage.  Be it firmware paths, or when folks moved things
under an soc{ } node.  But at the same time, just like each system has
a different partition layout, each system may have different heaps,
and its up to a system level config in userland to provide the policy
of what is used where.

Gralloc already exists on Android devices, you ask to allocate for a
use case, and it picks the heap. It could be *much* simpler (rather
than per-device implementations, I'm hoping to get to a single
implementation with a fstab like config file), but it's already widely
used.

I'm not sure I'm following this static per-heap requirement bit . Can
you clarify?

There's a lot of other cases that are common on Android. One CMA heap
might be sized and reserved for camera usage, so it doesn't have to
compete with other CMA users to quickly get a bunch of frames.  Where
as another CMA heap might be specified for a HWFB if that has to be
contiguous.  Again, it's less about the specific attributes
(contiguous/secure/etc - though those are important considerations
when creating the mapping for it to work properly), and more of a
higher level "for this use case or this pipeline, we use this heap"
mapping.

Just like an application might store data to /home/ which maps to to a
specific partition configured on a specific system, instead of
looking for things like "what partition has the most space".
