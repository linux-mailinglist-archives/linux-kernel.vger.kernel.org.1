I can also confirm that Pegasos2 users in the Amiga scene are running Linu=
x
(Debian) on these machines.

>> * powerpc/amigaone: last updated in 2009
I still have 2 of the 3 types of the first generation AmigaOne machines (n=
ot
to be confused with the newer AmigaOne X1000 and X5000 machines based on
PASemi and P5020 CPUs) working here. A third machine needs a repair of the
G4 CPU module (replacement parts already available).
I have to admit however that I yet have to setup an environment that allow=
s
me to regularly test new Linux kernel versions on these machines. Especial=
ly
because there are not many Linux users for these machines - which is likel=
y
due to the fact that no distribution officially supports these machines ou=
t
of the box (the Pegasos2 platform had more luck here). Inputs on how to
automate tests would therefore be very welcome!
Given however that the Debian PowerPC port has a proper maintainer again
(kudos to Adrian!) and there is also another new PowerPC distro (Void Linu=
x),
I would like to ask for a period of grace. After all this is just a hobby
project for me, so keeping up with the pace of the Linux development isn't
always that easy (and no, work on this did not stop in 2009, but shifted m=
ore
towards distro support since then).
