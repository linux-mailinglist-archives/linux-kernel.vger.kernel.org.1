Ya, thanks, that's a pretty straight-forward issue.  I've To'd you on a patch,
but it's essentially just exactly what you suggested so I doubt it's that
interesting.

I pointed out in the patch notes that it seems reasonable to have the generic
code handle this case, would you be opposed to doing it that way?
