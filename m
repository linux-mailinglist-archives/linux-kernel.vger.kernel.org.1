I understand your point and having an out of the box kernel-based
solution would be more helpful for the users.

My point was from the resource planning perspective i.e. have
flexibility on the amount of resources (CPU) to dedicate for proactive
reclaim.

To calculate the amount to reclaim with the memory.reclaim interface
in production, we actually use two sources of information, refault
rate and idle age histogram (extracted from a more efficient version
of Page Idle Tracking).

For this point I think we want more flexibility to control the
resources we want to dedicate for proactive reclaim. One particular
example from our production is the batch jobs with high memory
footprint. These jobs don't have enough CPU quota but we do want to
proactively reclaim from them. We would prefer to dedicate some amount
of CPU to proactively reclaim from them independent of their own CPU
quota.
