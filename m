You likely had some reason to do that clean up, right? What was that? An
inconcistency in handling some of the page flags when it is moved around
LRU lists? Was the code too hard to reason about? Was it error prone?

Please do not take me wrong, I am not trying to discourage you from
clean up work. There is a lot of code that would benefit from clean ups.
But it certainly helps to outline your motivation and the goal you would
like to achieve. Without that it would boil down to guessing what you
might have thought or simly moving things around without a very good
long term reason.

Thanks!
