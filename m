Yeah it would be nice to get the benefits everywhere automatically. But I guess
the compiler would have to discard the idempotence assumptions if there are
multiple consecutive (perhaps hidden behind page flag access)
compound_head(page) from a function, as soon as we modify the struct page somewhere.

Hmm the function converts the compound mapcount of the whole page to a
HPAGE_PMD_NR of base pages. If suddenly the compound page was bigger than a pmd,
then I guess this wouldn't work properly anymore without changes anyway?
Maybe we could stick something like VM_BUG_ON(PageTransHuge(page)) there as
"enforced documentation" for now?
