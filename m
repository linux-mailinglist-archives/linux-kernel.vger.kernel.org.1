Looks like I was confused again. Your formula is correct and mine is
wrong. My mistake is I thought that your patch "limit the range of LRU
type balancing"
which makes scan *ratio* 2:1 leads to actual scan *count* ratio
between anon/file to 2:1.
But, now I realized that 2:1 is just scan ratio and actual scan
*count* ratio could be far
larger with certain list size. It would be X * scan ratio in above example =
so my
explanation is wrong and you are right.

Sorry for making a trouble.

Okay. Now I think that this patch has a net improvement.
