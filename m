Many thx for you comments. Consider all the obvious spelling and
grammatical mistakes you pointed out fixed, I won't mention all of them
in this reply to keep things easier to follow.

I raised that problem in the cover letter, as this is not the only place
where it would make sense. Hoping for input from Jonathan here how to do
that without adding lots of anchors...

Elsewhere and this step and that document likely needs to be heavily
updated anyway, as pointed out in a later patch :-/

Googled a bit and to me as a non-native English speaker looks like
you're correct.

Uggh, sorry, this mistake will show up a few more times, looks like I

Hmmm. Normally I'd agree, but I used past tense here because it refers

I only meant "rc1" here, not every rc. More about this in a later patch.

Regarding explaining "rc" as "release candidate": my stupid brain has a
really hard time following that suggestion, as it still remembers some
words someone named Linus Torvalds wrote many many years ago:
```
I'll just use "-rc", and we can all agree that it stands for "Ridiculous
Count" rather than "Release Candidate".
```
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Pine.LNX.4.58.0410221821030.2101@ppc970.osdl.org/


I'll go and try to find some pills to force my brain into compliance.
;-) Once they start to work it hopefully can agree to this:

Do proactive testing: retest with at least every first release candidate
(RC) of a new mainline version and report your results.

Ciao, Thorsten
