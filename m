Yes, but let me try to understand better. There are 2 problems here I think:

1. ksoftirqd getting idled when HT is turned on, because uperf is sharing a
core with it: This should not be any worse than SMT OFF, because even SMT OFF
would also reduce ksoftirqd's CPU time just core sched is doing. Sure
core-scheduling adds some overhead with IPIs but such a huge drop of perf is
strange. Peter any thoughts on that?

2. Interface: To solve the performance problem, you are saying you want uperf
to share a core with ksoftirqd so that it is not forced into idle.  Why not
just keep uperf out of the cgroup? Then it will have cookie 0 and be able to
share core with kernel threads. About user-user isolation that you need, if
you tag any "untrusted" threads by adding it to CGroup, then there will
automatically isolated from uperf while allowing uperf to share CPU with
kernel threads.

Please let me know your thoughts and thanks,
