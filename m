Kernel log messages are almost never useful for actual users. In most
cases, they just clog up the kernel log, making it useless for when it
actually counts (such as when the system crashes). On top of that,
there already is an error message, only the error code doesn't mean
much because it is "universalized". I don't see how adding another
error message would improve that, even more so if that error message
is only added in one place. On the other side, converting EC error
codes to Linux kernel error codes would help every caller of
cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status without adding more logging noise.

That is exactly what -EBUSY is for: It lets the user space application
decide what to do about it. A kernel log message can not and will
never achieve that.

You are effectively saying that there is code to ensure that
i2s_rx_enabled is false. Granted, the code is too complex to easily
understand, and I may not have seen that flow. Per the same logic,
though, it might well be possible that _because_ the code is not easy
to understand there may well be a data path where i2s_rx_enabled is
set. One would need to ensure that the sequence of <disable rx> - <set
dai format> - <re-enable rx> is guaranteed, and that it is always
executed under a kernel lock. Maybe you can point me to that code, for
my education.

On the other side, it is much easier to verify that "daifmt >=3D
EC_CODEC_I2S_RX_DAIFMT_COUNT" is never true.
