Yeah, it better be printed, especially after it's included in watermark
calculation, so we're less confused by reports of allocation failure where
watermarks are seemingly ok.

Unfortunately there's a problem when trying to account free pages of a migrate
type exactly, as e.g. during reserve_highatomic_pageblock(), some pages might be
in pcplist of other cpu with other migratetype, and once they are freed, the
buddy merging will merge the different migratetypes and distort the accounting.
Fixing this for all migratetypes would have performance overhead, so we only do
that for MIGRATE_ISOLATE which is not that frequent (and it took a while to
eliminate all corner cases), and CMA which doesn't change pageblocks dynamically.

So either we live with the possible overreclaim due to inaccurate counting per
your example above, or we instead let order-0 atomic allocations use highatomic
reserves.
