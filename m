Yes, because prepare_for_transfer is actually init_and_start. I'm not
in favor of hiding what is really done at mhi_core level, start is
start and stop is stop, if it's correctly documented that should not
be confusing. just saying (stop moves channels in stop state, start in
enabled state), but other opinions are welcome.

Ok, your point is valid.
