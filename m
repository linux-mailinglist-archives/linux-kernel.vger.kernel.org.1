I really don't follow this logic. You're talking about reclaim-induced latency, 
but the alternative isn't freedom from latency, it's scheduler-induced latency 
from allocator throttling (and probably of a significantly higher magnitude). 
And again, that's totally justified if you are part of a cgroup which is 
significantly above its memory.high -- that's the kind of grouping you sign up 
for when you put multiple tasks in the same cgroup.

The premise of being over memory.high is that everyone in the affected cgroup 
must do their utmost to reclaim where possible, and if they fail to get below 
it again, we're going to deschedule them. *That's* what's best-effort about it.

The losers aren't hard to predict. It's *all* the tasks in this cgroup if they 
don't each make their utmost attempt to get the cgroup's memory back under 
control. Doing more reclaim isn't even in the same magnitude of sucking as 
getting allocator throttled.
