No, in our use case memory hot remove done during shutdown.

Yes, we wondered about it too.  One panic stack trace (after many OOM kills)

Then while searching I came across documented warning below.  In above 
instance panic after OOM kills happened after 3+ days of stress run (a 
mixure of ttcp, cpuloadgen and fio).

Warning

Extreme values can damage your system. Setting min_free_kbytes to an 
extremely low value prevents the system from reclaiming memory, which 
can result in system hangs and OOM-killing processes. However, setting 
min_free_kbytes too high (for example, to 5â€“10% of total system memory) 
causes the system to enter an out-of-memory state immediately, resulting 
in the system spending too much time reclaiming memory.
