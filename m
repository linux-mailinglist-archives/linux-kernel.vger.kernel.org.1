Defconfig is absolutely not the appropriate way to work around bugs - 
it's merely a starting point for users and distros to set up their own 
kernel, and if they can still enable this option and render their system 
unusable then patching some other config that they aren't using is 
pointless. To usefully mitigate a problem you'd need to make sure the 
offending option cannot be selected at all (i.e. prohibit 
HAVE_IRQ_TASK_ACCOUNTING as well).

Having glanced across another thread that mentions IRQ accounting 
recently[1], I wonder if the underlying bug here might have something do 
to with the stuff that Marc's trying to clean up.
