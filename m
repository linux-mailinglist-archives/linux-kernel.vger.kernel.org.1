I guess to start, it wasn't obvious (to me) that there were two
choices and we were picking one.  Mentioning that the other
alternative was way-based allocation would help a lot.  Even if you
can't fully explain the differences between the two, adding something
to the commit message indicating that this is a policy decision (in
other words, both work but each have their tradeoffs) would help.
Something like this, if it's correct:

In general we try to enable capacity based allocation (instead of the
default way based allocation) since that gives us better performance
with the current software / hardware configuration.

If you do it right, you'd only need to add lines to the SoCs that need
it.  Linux conventions in general are that it's OK (and encouraged) to
rely on the fact that if you don't mention a variable in static
initialization it's initted to 0/False/NULL.  So if the member
variable is "need_llcc_config" then you only need to add this in
places where you're setting it to true.  It only needs to be a boolean
so if later someone really is worried about all the bytes that flags
like this are taking up we can use a bitfield.  For now (presumably)
just adding a boolean would be more efficient since (presumably) the
extra code needed to access a bitfield would be more than the extra
data bytes used.  In theory this could also be initdata probably, too.

Are you trying to save space?  ...or complexity?  Sure a good compiler
will probably pool the constant string here so you won't need to
allocate it twice, but IMO having a second match table is more
complex.  You also need at least a pointer + bool per entry.  Each
probe will now need to parse through all these strings, too.  None of
this is a big deal, but I'd bet just adding a field to the existing
struct is lower overhead all around.

Someone could feel free to vote against me, but I'd just add to the
existing config.
