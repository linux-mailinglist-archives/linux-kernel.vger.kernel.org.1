OK, I was not aware we already CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT in the three. There is
still a lot from the RT patchset including sleeping spin locks that make
a real difference. Or maybe I haven't checked properly.

I have already sent a clarification patch [1]. NMI is not supported
regardless of the preemption mode. Hope this clarifies it a bit.
