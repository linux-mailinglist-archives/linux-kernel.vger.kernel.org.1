But "mounting" is the common term we all know.  "no-fs" doesn't really
describe what is happening here, right?  Everything works internally
just fine, but we just are forbidding the filesystem to be mounted.

Preventing the registering of the filesystem does cut out the ability to
mount the thing quite well :)

We could change it to just prevent the superblock from mounting if you
want, as maybe we do need the fs to remain in the list of filesystems in
the kernel at that point in time?  Otherwise we are lying to userspace.
