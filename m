Well, at some point we have to make a judgement call if the facts aren't 
easy to come by, but it's already clear that "A95X" is not a vendor but 
some kind of generic model name apparently used by multiple vendors. We 
already have "nexbox,a95x" as a binding for another model, and a 
plausible idea of who's responsible for this one, so I think 
"zkmagic,a95x-z2" would be the appropriate binding here. It's hardly the 
end of the world if it's not 100% accurate, but that's no excuse not to 
at least try.
