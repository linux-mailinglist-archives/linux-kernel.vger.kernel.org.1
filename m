Yeah I can understand your concern, however so far it's not about the perf but
correctness.  Documentation/core-api/pin_user_pages.rst tells us that we should
always use pin_user_page*() APIs to pin DMA pages (with FOLL_LONGTERM).  That's
something we should follow for now, otherwise the major logic of either
FOLL_PIN or FULL_LONGTERM could be bypassed without being noticed.

I'm not sure whether the perf issue is a big one.  So have you tried the pin
page APIs first and did some measurement?  There is indeed a tight loop in
follow_hugetlb_page() however not sure how much it'll affect VFIO_IOMMU_MAP_DMA
in general.  Even if we want to do something, it seems to be more suitable to
be done inside follow_hugetlb_page() rather than in vfio, imho.

Another comment is about the design of the whole patch - I think Alex commented
on that too on the awkwardness on appending the hugetlbfs logic to the end of
the existing logic.  Considering that current logic of vfio_pin_pages_remote()
is "let's pin some pages as long as continuous", not sure whether we can make
it into:

vfio_pin_pages_remote()
{
  if (PageHuge(first_page))
    vfio_pin_pages_hugetlbfs();
  else
    vfio_pin_pages_normal();
}

The thing is, if the 1st page is normal page, then the follow-up pages
shouldn't normally be hugetlbfs pages so they won't be physically continuous.
Vice versa.  In other words, each call to vfio_pin_pages_remote() should only
handle only one type of page after all.  So maybe we can diverge them at the
beginning of the call directly.
