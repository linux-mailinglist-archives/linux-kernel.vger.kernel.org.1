Then it seems you cannot read your own driver. At no point do you
set the parent_device that would give you a fighting chance to
get the device clocked and powered on. How does it work? Magic?

The reference count on *what*? There is nothing to take a reference
on. So yes, you understand how the core kernel works. But you don't
seem to notice that there is no link between the irq and the device
that implements the controller.

I strongly suggest you start by fixing the damn driver first.

In the meantime, NAK to this patch.
