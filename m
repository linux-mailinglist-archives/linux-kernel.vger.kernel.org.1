The issue is that there are multiple parallel memory accesses
happening at the same time, for example CP (the cmdstream processor)
will be reading ahead and setting things up for the next draw or
compute grid, in parallel with some memory accesses from the shader
which could trigger a fault.  (And with faults triggered by something
in the shader, there are *many* shader threads running in parallel so
those tend to generate a big number of faults at the same time.)

We need either CFCFG or HUPCF, otherwise what I have observed is that
while the fault happens, CP's memory access will start returning
zero's instead of valid cmdstream data, which triggers a GPU hang.  I
can't say whether this is something unique to qcom's implementation of
the smmu spec or not.

*Often* a fault is the result of the usermode gl/vk/cl driver bug,
although I don't think that is an argument against fixing this in the
smmu driver.. I've been carrying around a local patch to set HUPCF for
*years* because debugging usermode driver issues is so much harder
without.  But there are some APIs where faults can be caused by the
user's app on top of the usermode driver.
