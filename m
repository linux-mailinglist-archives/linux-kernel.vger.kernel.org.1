Apologies, the recipients list got mixed up.

Agree. I didn't include the kernel implementation on purpose, because I would
like to find an agreement on the binding first. Once we have it, I will update
the patch with the fixes and after that I will present the kernel
implementation. The consumers for this information will be EAS and the thermal
framework.

The example given here is referring to SCMI in order to provide a clear and
direct example of a scenario. However, the proposed binding is not SCMI
specific. It allows DT to describe a generic hardware property, CPU performance
dependency, which may not be available through other sources.

SCMI is designed to offer points of control, not hardware description, and
therefore lacks this information. Other platforms with FW/HW coordinated
performance control may need to provide the same information to the OS and can
use this binding too.

OPPs are related to CPUs. The binding is describing which CPUs are roughly
linked in terms of performance level due to hw implementation. The exact
performance level of each CPU may vary within the same dependency domain.

Since you can mix and match different cores types within a cluster, having two
of three performance dependency domains within a cluster would be expected.

This could be a platform where this binding would be necessary:

CPU:              0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7
Type:             A    A    A    A    B    B    B    B
Cluster:         [                                    ]
perf-controls:   [  ] [  ] [  ] [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]  [ ]
perf-dependency: [                ]  [                ]
HW clock:        [                ]  [                ]

Idle-states are unrelated (ACPI describes separately as well).

True. It is there only for completeness of information and offer a wider picture
on the context. It provides a comparison with dt, showing that ACPI provides
both controls and dependencies information to be provided to the OS.

Can be removed if required (this and the above).

It's an example and simply an attempt to make it as generic as possible. I could
not come up with better names. Open for suggestions.
