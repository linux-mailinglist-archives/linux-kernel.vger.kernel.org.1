I understand it is not unregistered.  However mhi_cntrl->irq[0] may be 
reserved for BHI, and thus only exercised by PBL EE.  Where as, 
mhi_cntrl->irq[1..N] may be only exercised by AMSS EE. 
mhi_intvec_handler is not called in response to mhi_cntrl->irq[1..N].

Additionally, I re-reviewed the MHI spec, and I don't see where the spec 
requires the device to issue an interrupt upon completion of the RESET 
request.

Under section 3.5, step 11 states -

"The host must poll for the value of the RESET bit to detect the 
completion of the reset procedure by the device (RESET is set to 0)."

So, by this, my proposed solution appears to be spec compliant, where as 
what Hemant proposed is not.

You seem to have misunderstood my point.  If the BHI irq is only for BHI 
activity, which is activity restricted to the PBL EE, and the MHI 
interrupt(s) are restricted to MHI activity, which for the purposes of 
this discussion only occur in the AMSS EE, then my assumption is 
correct.  When the device is in PBL EE, we should only observe BHI irqs, 
and when the device is in AMSS EE, we should only observe MHI irqs.

This is a statement of what IRQ lines the device is raising, and not a 
statement of what handlers the host has, or has not registered.

Again, if the BHI irq is only generated in the PBL EE, and we rely on 
the BHI irq for "sensing" the state_event - we will never see the 
state_event in the AMSS EE, unless the same IRQ line is used for both 
MHI and BHI (which is only a select set of usecases, and not universal).
