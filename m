Thanks, I'll start some tests going shortly.

I do have to "port" these patches to a different kernel, and my first
assumption on seeing crashes was that I'd screwed that up; but that
seemed much less likely once the home test on top of v5.8-rc5 crashed
in much the same way.  The latter was not a list_del() crash, but on
curr->func itself; but I take them all as just indicating that the
wait queue entry can in rare cases be freed and reused.

(And the amount of "port"ing was close to nil here: our trees did
differ on an "unlikely" that one end had added or removed, plus I
did start off by reverting two of my three patches. But perhaps I'm
missing a subtle dependence on differences elsewhere in the tree.)

I say that for full disclosure, so you don't wrack your brains
too much, when it may still turn out to be a screwup on my part.

Hugh
