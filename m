I was around for one of the informal conversations with Greg and Kees
and others.

As I recall, Greg's biggest condition for initial introduction of this
was to do the same kind of "turn this Kconfig option on and turn an
option under it off" trick that LTO uses, so that neither "make
allnoconfig" nor "make allyesconfig" would require Rust until we've had
plenty of time to experiment with it. And that seems entirely
reasonable to me too.
