I believe the problem is in the Lenovo firmware and not in the kernel.

There are essentially two problems:
  1. TPM 2.0 doesn't work when the IOMMU is enabled
  2. Suspend/shutdown hangs when problem 1 is encountered on boot

Lenovo's firmware implementation of TPM 2.0 functionality on some of their
laptops uses DMA. When you ask the kernel to enable the IOMMU, this DMA
access is correctly blocked by the IOMMU hardware. If you look at your
dmesg log from when you have TPM 2.0 and the IOMMU enabled, there are
TPM timeout messages that indicate the inability to initialize and use
the TPM capability.

The hang on shutdown or S3 suspend appears to be in firmware, i.e.
after the kernel has transferred control back to the firmware.
It makes no difference if the kernel actively shuts down the IOMMU
before transferring control to the firmware on a suspend or shutdown.
The hang still occurs.

My guess is that the firmware wants to do some TPM related processing
on shutdown and suspend and can't handle the TPM state that exists
due to the startup failure. But that's just a guess. I don't know
what the firmware is actually doing.

Some Lenovo laptops provide an ACPI DMAR RMRR that identifies the memory
range that the kernel should open up for permissable DMA access
for this purpose. Unfortunately, the PCI device that performs these
DMA operations is hidden from the kernel by the BIOS. Given that the
associated PCI device is hidden, the Linux kernel does not act upon
the associated DMAR RMRR.
