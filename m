Yeah, the vendor apparently was not of the humble kind :)

Adding Samuel to CC.

From what I understood is that in order to access the buttons reported in 
report #2 (the one marked with HID_MAIN_ITEM_CONSTANT), you actually *do* 
need a special software on windows anyway.

What we do is that we ignore any changes in reports with 
HID_MAIN_ITEM_CONSTANT in the HID core.

It would still be possible to access the report via hidraw, and maybe 
that's analogy of what the Windows driver/special Glorious software :) 
does, I don't know. It's hard to believe that Windows would be actually 
willing to report any changes coming through HID_MAIN_ITEM_CONSTANT 
reports, but who knows.
