It probably wouldn't hurt to keep hold of the lock during single
stepping but I don't think there's any real reason we'd want to.
Specifically the only real reason we're calling rcu_read_lock() is to
avoid the warning.  Since we're a stop-the-world debugger it's not
like something else could be messing with state at the same time.

I'm looking at the whole function though and I don't really understand
all the comments about interrupts being restored by the 'trap return'
code, do you?  Specifically: as far as I can tell we _always_ restore
interrupts when exiting the function.  There are only two return
statements and both have "local_irq_restore(flags);" right before
them.  We never modify the flags directly and the one other usage of
"flags" is effectively the statement "local_irq_restore(flags);
local_irq_save(flags);" which will, I guess, allow any interrupts that
were already pending to take place.  Are you saying that you want me
to match that and do a "rcu_read_unlock(); rcu_read_lock()" there?

If I understand things correctly (and there's maybe a better chance
after I read Wei Li's recent patches) the disabling of IRQs for single
stepping happens in a different way.  It looks like we update the
"struct pt_regs" of the task we're stepping so that when we exit kgdb
and start running the task again that the interrupts are off.  That
seems reasonable to me and this function has nothing to do with it.

...and further confusion on my part: does the whole saving / restoring
of interrupts in kgdb_cpu_enter() make any sense anyway?  Is this
function ever called from a context that's not an interrupt context?
How do we get the pt_regs in that case?  Just for fun, I tried doing
this:

    local_irq_save(flags);
+   if (!arch_irqs_disabled_flags(flags))
+           pr_warn("I was wrong\n");

...and I never saw "I was wrong" on my system.  Maybe it matters for
something not arm64?  ...or, maybe, this is from when kgdb worked in a
completely different way?


In general I made my patch by:
* Calling rcu_read_lock() at the start of the function.
* Calling rcu_read_unlock() right before all 2 of the "return" calls of
  the function.

...I was hoping that would actually make it easier to reason about
even if the function is a beast.


Hopefully the above makes sense.  I wouldn't rule out me just being
utterly confused, but I _think_ I reasoned through it all.  ;-)  If it
all makes sense, I'm inclined to:

1. Leave my patch the way it is.

2. Perhaps remove the whole irq saving / restoring in kgdb_cpu_enter().
