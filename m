 An example with a really long member name is

+struct nokia_modem_device *modem = from_tasklet(modem, t,
+        nokia_modem_rst_ind_tasklet);

With container_of() one can imagine how long it would end up. And
am sure we have many more examples in the kernel.

I agree, It would have been simpler to use container_of() as it's been
widely used, but as mentioned by Kees, for 1-to-many conversions
it does not work well.

I guess container_from() is a NAK, if you would want us to just use
container_of() to keep the code clean and simple instead of using wrappers,
or any other method, we are open to suggestions.

Thanks,
