Ok, nice, I think we can consider the issue being analyzed then ;)

Oh, right, the error code path will be quite different, checking ...

[ code context added ]

qxl_release_free() checks whenever a release is fenced and signals the
fence in case it is so it doesn't wait for the signal forever.  So, yes,
I think qxl_release_free() should cleanup the release properly in any
case and the patch chunk should be correct.

take care,
  Gerd
