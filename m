Maybe you could add that 'the throttled parent was already added back to
the list by a task enqueue in a parallel child hierarchy'.

IMHO, this is part of the description because otherwise the throttled
parent would have connected the branch.

And the not-adding of the intermediate child cfs_rq would have gone
unnoticed.
