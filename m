You better can for any user space controllable flooding source.

You still did not explain which contexts can create flooding. I gave you
a complete list a few mails ago, but you still did not tell which of the
contexts can cause flooding.

If it's any context which is not sleepable or controllable in any way,
then any attempt to mitigate it is a lost battle:

  A dependency on allocating memory to free memory is a dead end by
  definition.

Any flooder which is uncontrollable is a bug and no matter what kind of
hacks you provide, it will be able to bring the whole thing down.

So far this looks like you're trying to cure the symptoms, which is
wrong to begin with.

If the flooder is controllable then there is no problem with cache
misses at all unless the RCU free callbacks are not able to catch up
which is yet another problem which you can't cure by allocating more
memory.

Thanks,
