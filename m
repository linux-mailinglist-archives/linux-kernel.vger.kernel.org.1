I just ran a bunch of KCSAN tests. While this series alone would have
passed the tests, there appears to be a problem with
__READ_ONCE/__WRITE_ONCE. I think they should already be using
'data_race()', as otherwise we will get lots of false positives in
future.

I noticed this when testing -tip/locking/kcsan, which breaks
unfortunately, because I see a bunch of spurious data races with
arch_atomic_{read,set} because "locking/atomics: Flip fallbacks and
instrumentation" changed them to use __READ_ONCE()/__WRITE_ONCE().
From what I see, the intent was to not double-instrument,
unfortunately they are still double-instrumented because
__READ_ONCE/__WRITE_ONCE doesn't hide the access from KCSAN (nor KASAN
actually). I don't think we can use __no_sanitize_or_inline for the
arch_ functions, because we really want them to be __always_inline
(also to avoid calls to these functions in uaccess regions, which
objtool would notice).

I think the easiest way to resolve this is to wrap the accesses in
__*_ONCE with data_race().

Thanks,
