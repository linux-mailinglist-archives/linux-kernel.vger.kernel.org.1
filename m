Thinking some more about this. LMKD in the above-mentioned usecase is
not a privileged process but it is granted access to PSI triggers by a
privileged init process+sepolicy and it needs RT threads to react to
memory pressure promptly without being preempted. If we allow only the
privileged users to have RT threads for PSI triggers then that
requirement would break this scenario and LMKD won't be able to use RT
threads.
