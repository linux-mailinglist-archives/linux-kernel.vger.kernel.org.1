Hi Sebastian & list,

I had assumed that my e-mail had got lost or overlooked, I was meaning to
post a follow up message this week...

All I could find from the debugging and tracing that we added was that
something was going wrong with the mm data structures somewhere in the
exec code.  In the end I just spent a week or two pouring over the diffs
of this code between the versions that I new worked and didn't work.

I eventually found the culprit.  On the working kernel versions there is
a patch called "mm: Protect activate_mm() by preempt_[disable&enable]_rt()"=
.
This is commit f0b4a9cb253a on the V4.19.82-rt30 branch, for instance.
Although the commit message talks about ARM, it seems that we need this for
PowerPC too (I guess, any PowerPC with the "nohash" MMU?).

Could you please add this commit back to the RT branch?  I'm not sure how
to find out the history of this commit.  For instance, why has it been
removed from the RT patchset?  How are these things tracked, generally?

Best regards,
Mark
