Good day from Singapore,

I am sharing the below news article:

Synopis:

- Scientists built a 27-mile long prototype quantum internet in the US
- They successfully used quantum entanglement to teleport signals 
instantly
- The phenomenon sees qubits, the quantum equivalent of computer bits, 
pair up and respond instantly

Scientists have demonstrated long-distance 'quantum teleportation' – the 
instant transfer of units of quantum information known as qubits – for 
the first time.

The qubits were transferred faster than the speed of light over a 
distance of 27 miles, laying the foundations for a quantum internet 
service, which could one day revolutionise computing.

Quantum communication systems are faster and more secure than regular 
networks because they use photons rather than computer code, which can 
be hacked.

But their development relies on cutting-edge scientific theory which 
transforms our understanding of how computers work.

In a quantum internet, information stored in qubits (the quantum 
equivalent of computer bits) is shuttled, or 'teleported', over long 
distances through entanglement.

Entanglement is a phenomenon whereby two particles are linked in such a 
way that information shared with one is shared with the other at exactly 
the same time.

This means that the quantum state of each particle is dependent on the 
state of the other – even when they are separated by a large distance.

Quantum teleportation, therefore, is the transfer of quantum states from 
one location to the other.

However, it is highly sensitive to environmental interference that can 
easily disrupt the quality or 'fidelity' of teleportation, so proving 
the theory in practice has been technologically challenging.

In their latest experiment, researchers from Caltech, NASA, and Fermilab 
(Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory) built a unique system between 
two labs separated by 27 miles (44km).

The system comprises three nodes which interact with one another to 
trigger a sequence of qubits, which pass a signal from one place to the 
other instantly.

The 'teleportation' is instant, occurring faster than the speed of 
light, and the researchers reported a fidelity of more than 90 percent, 
according to the new study, published in PRX Quantum.

Fidelity is used to measure how close the resulting qubit signal is to 
the original message that was sent.

'This high fidelity is important especially in the case of quantum 
networks designed to connect advanced quantum devices, including quantum 
sensors,' explains Professor Maria Spiropulu from Caltech.

The findings of the project are crucial to hopes of a future quantum 
internet as well as pushing the boundaries of what scientists known 
about the quantum realm.

Although the technology is yet to reach the point of being rolled out 
beyond sophisticated tests such as this, there are already plans for how 
policy makers will employ the technology.

For example, the US Department of Energy hopes to erect a quantum 
network between its laboratories across the states.

The power of a quantum computer running on quantum internet will likely 
exceed the speeds of the world's current most sophisticated 
supercomputers by around 100 trillion times.

'People on social media are asking if they should sign up for a quantum 
internet provider (jokingly of course),' Professor Spiropulu told 
Motherboard.

'We need (a lot) more R&D work.'

WHAT IS QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT?

In quantum physics, entangled particles remain connected so that actions 
performed by one affects the behaviour of the other, even if they are 
separated by huge distances.

This means if you measure, 'up' for the spin of one photon from an 
entangled pair, the spin of the other, measured an instant later, will 
be 'down' - even if the two are on opposite sides of the world.

Entanglement takes place when a part of particles interact physically.

For instance, a laser beam fired through a certain type of crystal can 
cause individual light particles to be split into pairs of entangled 
photons.

The theory that so riled Einstein is also referred to as 'spooky action 
at a distance'.

Einstein wasn't happy with theory, because it suggested that information 
could travel faster than light.
