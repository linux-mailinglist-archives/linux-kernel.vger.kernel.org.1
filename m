so this is the only region is the QFPROM fuses can be programmed!

Is this some kind of FEC corrected regions?

Is this only applicable for corrected address space?

May be "qcom,sc7180-qfprom"

Encompassing these offsets in driver as part of the register defines 
itself should be a good start!

It will also be nice to understand how similar this thing is with w.rt 
other Qcom SoCs?

I will leave this question to the author of the driver.
