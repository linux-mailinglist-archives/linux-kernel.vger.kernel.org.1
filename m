I considered doing this when adding "all" for RCU, but was just too
lazy.  So you are a better man than I am!  ;-)

I have queued these for testing, both "all" and "last" work just fine.
Given that "all" works, I hereby declare "none" to be working by
inspection.  Therefore, for 1, 2, and 4:

For 3:

Or I can carry them if you wish.  My expected changes in response to
this series are shown below, and are also what I used to test it.
