I guess defconfig worked ok since tegra194-cpufreq is not a module so we
didn't bother much. The fault was reported for allmodconfig but the
discussion didn't conclude.

I push Kefeng's patch to the arm64 for-next/core branch which exports
cpu_logical_map() as a function. We can revert it later is the Tegra
driver is fixed.

I'll send Linus a pull request in a bit, once I finish testing the
branch.
