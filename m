Correct, this is not x86 specific. I put it in arch/x86 because that's currently
the only place were I use it, but it can be moved to linux/mm.

mm_struct doesn't define a generic page-table encapsulation. mm_struct references
a page table (i.e. PGD) and adds all kind of attributes needed for mm management but
not necessarily related to page-table.

Agree. I remember your attempt to extract the page-table from mm_struct; this is
not a simple work! For ASI, I didn't need mm, so it was simpler to built a simple
decorated page-table without attempting to use with mm (at least for now).

Thanks,

alex.

PS: if you want to play with dpt, there's a bug in dpt_destroy(), patch 08 adds a
a double free of dpt->backend_pages pages.
