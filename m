Yes the IMX and STM patches can be applied separately, they just 
both depend on the common regmap patches.

The binding API removal change which directly touches RK can also 
be applied separately, but unfortunately I do not have access to a 
RK board with a DSI display to test it (or the bridge regmap logic 
on RK btw...), I just "eye-balled" the RK code based on the public 
docs and it LGTM.
