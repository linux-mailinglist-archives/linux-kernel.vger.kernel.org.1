Sorry for missing the response for so long.
Somehow lost this thread in my mailbox.

From our tests NAU8825 is working fine with these parameters.
Also the output audio signal looks fine on the scope and FFT and there
are no audible glitches.

Czarek answered this and we got the same response from other Intel
devs while consulting this change:
FW cannot request a chosen rate (48k) for MCLK pin as it does not
"align with what's present on SKL hw".

The only way we found out for NAU8825 to cooperate at chosen rate with
SKL HW is to regen the MCLK from BCLK by FLL as mentioned above.
NHTL is used to set SSP0 (48k, 24/25 bit on 24MHz crystal).
If I get all of this right, use of NHTL and HW "abilities" would
explain why there is no call to change SSP from a machine driver.


If all of this is ok I will send V3 with msleep() removed.
