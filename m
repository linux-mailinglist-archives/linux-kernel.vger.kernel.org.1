I still don't understand.  In your patch in __tcs_buffer_write(), if
"wait_for_compl" is set then "CMD_MSGID_RESP_REQ" will be added for
every message in the request, right?  That's because you have this bit
of code:

/* Convert all commands to RR when the request has wait_for_compl set */
cmd_msgid |= msg->wait_for_compl ? CMD_MSGID_RESP_REQ : 0;

That means that if _either_ "cmd->wait" or "req->wait_for_compl" is
set then you expect the "sts" to have "CMD_STATUS_COMPL", right?
That's exactly the code that used to be there.

Said another way, if "req->wait_for_compl" was set then it's an error
if any of our commands are missing the "CMD_STATUS_COMPL" bit, right?

OK, but I guess my question is: who exactly cares about the completion
interrupt?

For rpmh_write_async() as soon as the commands are in the queue the
function returns.  There's no callback and rpmh_write_async() doesn't
set the "completion" to anything so there's nobody that cares at all,
right?  That means, effectively, it's not useful for anyone to set the
"wait" member when calling rpmh_write_async().

Ah, I see.  So the "wait" value _only_ matters for the batch case and
only for "active only" transfers.  I guess another thing that would be
nice to have in a comment somewhere, assuming I understood it all
correctly.
