Well there isn't a linux specific cma location property in ACPI. There 
are various ways to infer the information, like looking for the lowest 
_DMA() range and using that to lower the arm64_dma32_phys_limit. OTOH, 
as it stands I don't think that information is available early enough to 
setup the cma pool.

But as you mention the atomic pool code is allocating from CMA under the 
assumption that its going to be below the GFP_DMA range, which might not 
be generally true (due to lack of DT cma properties too?).
