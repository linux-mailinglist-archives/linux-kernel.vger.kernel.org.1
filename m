Summary of changes:
 * Support multiple instances of a component. For example there can be
   multiple I2S devices which can use the same component driver.

 * Support open platforms with empty Codec endpoint. Customers can plug
   their own HW and can populate codec endpoint.

 * In a component model there can be many components which can be
   connected togethe. In such cases Identify no-pcm DPCM DAI links which
   can be used in BE<->BE connections.

 * Add Tegra audio graph driver which is based on generic audio graph
   driver and specific customizations are done in Tegra driver.

 * This pushes DT support for Tegra210 based platforms which uses
   audio-graph card and above enhancements.

The series is based on following references where DPCM usgae for Tegra
Audio and simple-card driver proposal were discussed.

 * https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/4/30/519 (DPCM for Tegra)
 * https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/6/27/4 (simple-card driver)

Changelog
=========

v3 -> v4
--------
 * Added new patches to convert graph.txt and audio-graph-card.txt
   to corresponding json-schema files. Later these references
   are used in Tegra audio graph schema.

 * AHUB component binding docs are updated to reflect the usage
   of ports/port/endpoint

 * More common stuff is moved into graph_parse_of() and this is
   used by both generic and Tegra audio graph.

 * DT binding for Tegra audio graph is updated to included "ports { }"

 * As per the suggestion 'void *data' member is dropped from
   'asoc_simple_priv' and instead container method is used to
   maintain required custom data internal to Tegra audio graph. 

v2 -> v3
--------
 * Dropped new compatible addition in generic graph driver
   after reviewing it with Morimoto-san. Instead added Tegra
   audio graph driver and new compatibles are added in the same.
 * Added new patches to expose new members for customization
   in audio graph driver.
 * Added new patch for Tegra audio graph driver and related
   documentation.
 * Minor change in below commit where mutex version of helper is used
   "ASoC: audio-graph: Identify 'no_pcm' DAI links for DPCM"
 * DT binding is updated to use the newly exposed compatibles
 * No changes in other patches

v1 -> v2
--------
 * Re-organized ports/endpoints description for ADMAIF and XBAR.
   Updated DT patches accordingly.
 * After above change, multiple Codec endpoint support is not
   required and hence dropped for now. This will be considered
   separately if at all required in future.
 * Re-ordered patches in the series.
