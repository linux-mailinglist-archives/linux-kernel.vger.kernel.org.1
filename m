The ECC engine is not supposed to be used before nand_scan() and its
default state should be disabled. Maybe this driver needs an update
about that, but then -hopefully- it will be pretty straightforward.

No hurry though, if the fix is not ready we'll wait an additional week
(it will be in next as soon as it is ready anyway).
