Yes.

This was the primary reason I chose to do it this way for ext4.

The other is that ext4 didn't use crc32c before metadata_csum, so
there's no point in pulling in the crypto layer if you're only going to
use older ext2 or ext3 filesystems.  That was 2010, maybe people have
stopped doing that?

Though I would like to see the library functions gain the ability to use
whatever is the fastest mechanism available once we can be reasonably
certain that all the platform-specific drivers have been loaded.

That said, IIRC most distros compile all of them into their
(increasingly large) vmlinuz files so maybe this isn't much of practical
concern?
