Ah, sorry - I wasn't sure what the convention was around repeating the
applicable parts from the v1 changelog in this email.
Here's the description from the v1 patch:

Basically, for rr to work, we need to tightly control any user-visible
CPU behavior,
either by putting in the CPU in the right state or by trapping and emulatin=
g
(as we do for rdtsc, cpuid, etc). XCR0 controls a bunch of
user-visible CPU behavior,
namely:
1) The size of the xsave region if xsave is passed an all-ones mask
(which is fairly common)
2) The return value of xgetbv
3) Whether instructions making use of the relevant xstate component traps

In the v1 review, it was raised that user space could be adjusted to
deal with these
issues by always checking support in cpuid first (which is already emulatab=
le).
Unfortunately, we don't control the environment on the record side (rr supp=
orts
record on any Intel from the past decade - with the exception of a few that=
 have
microarchitecture bugs causing problems; and kernel versions back to 3.11),=
 so
trying to patch user space is unfortunately a no-go for us (as well as of c=
ourse
being a debugging tool, so we want to be able to help users debug if they g=
et
uses of these instructions wrong).

Another suggestion in the v1 review was to use a VM instead with an appropr=
iate
XCR0 value. That does mostly work, but has some problems:
1) The performance is quite a bit worse (particularly if we're already
replaying in a virtualized environment)
2) We may want to simultaneously replay tasks with different XCR0
values. This comes
into play e.g. when recording a distributed system where different
nodes in the system
are on hosts with different hardware configurations (the reason you
want to replay them
jointly rather than node-by-node is that this way you can avoid
recording any intra-node
communication, since you can just recompute it from the trace).

As a result, doing this will fully-featured VMs isn't an attractive
proposition. I had looked into
doing something more light-weight using the raw KVM API or something
analogous to what project dune did (http://dune.scs.stanford.edu/ -
basically implementing
linux user space, but where the threads run in guest CPL0 rather than
host CPL3).
My conclusion was that this approach too would require significant
kernel modification to
work well (as well as having the noted performance problems in
virtualized environments).

Sorry if this is too much of an info dump, but I hope this gives some color=
.
