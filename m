Fair enough, why not do cross call like in set_target ? Since it is one-off
in init, I don't see any issue when you are doing it runtime for set_target.

To be honest, we have tried to remove all the dependency on cluster id
in generic code as it is not well defined. This one is tegra specific
driver so should be fine. But I am still bit nervous to export
cpu_logical_map as we have no clue what that would mean for physical
hotplug.
