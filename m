*groan*.. that's going to be a mess with sinks that are shared between
CPUs :/

per-CPU sinks sounds a lot better.

I'm really not convinced it makes sense to do what you do with shared
sinks though. You'll loose random parts of the execution trace because
of what the other CPUs do.

Full exclusive sink access is far more deterministic.

pmu::add() I might hope, because pmu::start() is not allowed to fail.

Like said above, if sink is shared between CPUs, that's going to be a
trainwreck :/ Why do you want that?

And once you have per-CPU sinks like mentioned above, the whole problem
goes away.
