Thomas (and all)

Sorry.  We do need to do better.

In addition to Christoph's patches, we will soon be submitting
additional clean up patches.  Mike Travis is working on a patch
to remove old SGI UV1 code.  Dimitri Sivanich is working on a
sgi_rtc cleanup patch.  We are looking at additional cleanup
that should have been done previously.

Steve Wahl will be involved on an ongoing basis, so
you will see more from us.

Thanks.
