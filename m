Definitely a bike shed color issue.  I know it was double-looping before, but:

* Neither loop was very long, a few bits at most.

* The 2nd loop was in common code.  That means the "number of
instructions" to implement this loop is small--just a function call.
For code that isn't a hot spot it can be better to optimize for code
size rather than speed since it means you're taking up fewer cache
lines and thus less likely to kick out other code.  ;-)  ...but we're
getting into micro optimization.

In any case, I probably haven't convinced you.  I'm fine with your
code and I'll shut up now.

Sure.  ...though moving the set_bit() here is just pure churn, right?
It can be here or it can be in the calling function and there's really
no advantage either way.  If you really like it here then fine.  I
just see no benefit and it's just an extra line to change.
