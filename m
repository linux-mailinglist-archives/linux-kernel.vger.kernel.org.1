And just to argue against myself...

Another approach is to maintain explicit multiple states for each
->cblist, perhaps something like this:

1.	In softirq.  Transition code advances to next.
2.	To no-CB 1.  Either GP or CB kthread for the transitioning
	CPU advances to next.  Note that the fact that the
	transition code runs on the transitioning CPU means that
	the RCU softirq handler doesn't need to be involved.
3.	To no-CB 2.  Either GP or CB kthread for the transitioning
	CPU advances to next.
4.	To no-CB 3.  Transitioning code advances to next.
	At this point, the no-CBs setup is fully functional.
5.	No-CB.  Transitioning code advances to next.
	Again, the fact that the transitioning code is running
	on the transitioning CPU with interrupts disabled means
	that the RCU softirq handler need not be explicitly
	involved.
6.	To softirq 1.  The RCU softirq handler for the transitioning
	CPU advances to next.
	At this point, the RCU softirq handler is processing callbacks.
7.	To softirq 2.  Either GP or CB kthread for the transitioning
	CPU advances to next.
	At this point, the softirq handler is processing callbacks.
8.	To softirq 3.  Either GP or CB kthread for the transitioning
	CPU advances to next.
	At this point, the no-CBs setup is fully shut down.
9.	To softirq 4.  Transitioning code advances to next,
	which is the first, "In softirq".
	(This one -might- be unnecessary, but...)

All transitions are of course with the ->nocb_lock held.

When there is only one CPU during early boot near rcu_init() time,
the transition from "In softirq" to "No-CB" can remain be instantaneous.

This has the advantage of not slowing things down just because there
is an RCU callback flood in progress.  It also uses an explicit
protocol that should (give or take bugs) maintain full safety both
in protection of ->cblist and in dealing with RCU callback floods.

Thoughts?

							Thanx, Paul
