Driver does not depend on debugfs. i need to fix that.

Reason i added was, if MHI BUS is not enabled "MHI clients support"

no, in probe we do this
uci_dev->actual_mtu = uci_dev->mtu -  sizeof(struct uci_buf);
and save meta data uci_buf data ptr and len.  it is done in 
mhi_dl_xfer_cb() function and used in read().

yes that is based on ref count, so no double free. do you see any issue

Removing char dev node is done when MHI device is removed. It is 
possible that user space entity would exist but MHI device is removed
due to underlying transport disconnect. i dont see a way to prevent
this or i am missing your point. Can you pls elaborate your concern.

No, read needs to be blocked until data comes. user space would call 
read() and wait for data to arrive. There is no definite time when data 
would arrive.

how about keeping the number of bytes xferred and remove exit from the

This would help if client provided buffer is smaller than the received 
rx data. Even though this function would only copy the mount of buffer
provided by user space but we can track that condition.

This is same as what we are doing in write(). I can add the 
uci_dev->enabled check here as well and return -ENODEV as you commented 
for write(). Helps in debugging.

If your concern is about locking, i am going to come up with the change 
to fix that. If you concern is about node getting removed while read is 
issued then i dont see how we can prevent that.

In case remove() is in progress and enabled is set to false but 
destroy_device is not called yet. It covers that case and open() is 
called by user space entity.

done in release. For every open increment the ref count and for every

I can remove the enter and exit from the message but it helps to debug 
race conditions between remove() and open()/release(). i Can say 
something like removing mhi_dev->name

It is possible that ref_count becomes 0 in release() then it would be 
no-op here.

I can change it to mhi_dev->name removed. It helps in debugging race
