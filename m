For issues related to thermal or power, we don't expect to poke MSRs
from user space by any daemon. We have sysfs interfaces for the
required controls. This is also true for controls via MMIO space.
Anytime if it is safe to add, we are adding controls via sysfs.

The tool in question from the link (not from Intel), when developed may
not have TCC or RAPL-MMIO controls via sysfs. We have sysfs interfaces
for a while. They can send email to me to justify other controls if
any.
 
Only time direct MSR access is required is for debug tools like
turbostat.

This is not related to MSR or MMIO. This is related to some ACPI
tables. In Linux, thermald will adjust these knobs like Windows. It was
missing some ACPI details, which Matthew Garrett submitted patches to
kernel and getting merged with 5.8 series.

Thanks,
