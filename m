Yes. I didn't explicitly add the check because I thought it's still OK to count
the error cases, especially after we've discussed about
PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS in v1.  So far, the major reason (iiuc) to have
PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS still in per-arch handlers is to also cover these
corner cases like VM_FAULT_ERROR.  So to me it makes sense too to also count
them in here.  But I agree it changes the old counting on most archs.

Again, I don't have strong opinion either on this, just like the same to
PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS...  But if no one disagree, I will change this to:

  if (ret & (VM_FAULT_RETRY | VM_FAULT_ERROR))
      return ret;

So we try our best to follow the past.

Btw, note that there will still be some even more special corner cases. E.g.,
for ARM64 it's also not accounted for some ARM64 specific fault errors
(VM_FAULT_BADMAP, VM_FAULT_BADACCESS).  So even if we don't count
VM_FAULT_ERROR, we might still count these for ARM64.  We can try to redefine
VM_FAULT_ERROR in ARM64 to cover all the arch-specific errors, however that
seems an overkill to me sololy for fault accountings, so hopefully I can ignore
that difference.

Will fix both places.  Thanks,
