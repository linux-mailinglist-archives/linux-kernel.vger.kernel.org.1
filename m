Note that we group in pageblock granularity, which avoids fragmentation
on a pageblock level, not on anything bigger than that. Especially
MAX_ORDER - 1 pages (e.g., on x86-64) and gigantic pages.

So once you run for some time on a system (especially thinking about
page shuffling *within* a zone), trying to allocate a gigantic page will
simply always fail - even if you always had plenty of free memory in
your single zone.

Note the difference to MOVABLE: if you really want, you *can* put
movable allocations into that zone. So you can happily allocate gigantic
pages from it. Or anything else you like. As the name suggests "prefer
movable allocations".

Right, the long-term goal would be
1. To limit the chance of that happening. (e.g., size it in a way that's
safe for 99.9% of all setups, resize dynamically on demand)
2. To limit the physical area where that is happening (e.g., find lowest
possible pageblock etc.). That's more tricky but I consider this a pure
optimization on top.

As long as we stay in safe zone boundaries you get a benefit in most
scenarios. As soon as we would have a (temporary) workload that would
require more unmovable allocations we would fallback to polluting some
pageblocks only.

Same over here. I had this idea in my mind for quite a while but
obviously didn't get to figure out the details/implement yet - that's
why I decided to share the basic idea just now.
