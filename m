a 40-bit range is effectively the same as a 64-bit range though, so I
think you'll still need a driver quirk if the device cannot use the whole 40
bit addressing but is limited to 32 bits because of a bug in its dma engine.

I have not actually seen that change. In general, you should always
have a dma-ranges property in the parent of a DMA master, I think
we just never enforced that and fall back to a 32-bit mask by default.
