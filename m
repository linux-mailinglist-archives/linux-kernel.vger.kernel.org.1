There is no disagreement here.

Here is where we are not on the same page though. Once you have identified
that the main problem is that the reclaim fails too early to meet the
target then the fix would be to enforce that target. I have asked why
this hasn't been done and haven't got any real answer for that. Instead
what you call "a simple bug fix" has larger consequences which are not
really explained in the changelog and they are also not really trivial
to see. If the changelog explicitly stated that the proportional memory
reclaim is not sufficient because XYZ and the implementation has been
changed to instead meet the high limit target then this would be a
completely different story and I believe we could have saved some
discussion.

Agreed. But this stops being the case as soon as the reclaim target has
been reached and new reclaim attempts are enforced because the memcg is
still above the high limit. Because then you have a completely different
reclaim target - get down to the limit. This would be especially visible
with a large memcg_nr_pages_over_high which could even lead to an over
reclaim.
