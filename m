Yeah, I agree with your point. After looking into swap code a bit
(swapfile.c and swap.c), I think such code really needs to be
cleaned up... But I'm lack of motivation about this since I couldn't
guarantee to introduce some new regression and honestly I don't care
much about this piece of code.

Maybe some new projects based on this could help clean up that
as well. :)

Anyway, we really need a quick fix to avoid such FS corruption,
which looks dangerous on the consumer side.

Ok, anyway, that is another stuff and may need some other thread.
I will seek some time to send out a patch for further discussion later.

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
