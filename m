Yup, thanks. I realized that a bit after sending my email. :)

Yup -- Masahiro keeps poking the build system, but I haven't cleaned up
the header file macros to keep up with the recent jumps. (It falls a bit
low on my TODO list since it's a bit of a mechanical cleanup. I'm open
to anyone that would like to send patches, though!)

They're part of regular testing, and there is ongoing development
(e.g. see Alex Popov's recent series[1], which is in -next waiting for
the v5.9 merge window). I hear regularly from folks using randstruct,
stackleak, structleak, and latent_entropy. But yes, Google has moved
to Clang where we're using Clang's implementation of structleak
(auto-var-init) but there has been work to get randstruct ported (as
desired by at least one Android vendor), though it's currently stalled.
