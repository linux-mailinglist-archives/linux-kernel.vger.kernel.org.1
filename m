I see what I misunderstoold about the hugetlb_lock holding. The
put_page() is called after releasing hugetlb_lock in
alloc_surplus_huge_page(), I mistakenly got put_page() is inside
hugetlb_lock. Yes, there's obviously a race window, and the temporary
page way is an effective way to not mess up the surplus_huge_pages
accounting.
