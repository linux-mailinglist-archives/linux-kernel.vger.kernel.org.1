IIUC, you are doing the job twice: you should just return a number of
bitflips or an error to the NAND core. So that's why I'm telling that
you should get rid of this threshold. It would avoid the need for the
PIO transfer too.

You also say that the controller "only increments correctable ECC
count", what do you mean exactly? The controller does not report errors
when the number of bitflips happens to be above the BCH threshold? This
would be the only case where what is currently done would be actually
needed though.
