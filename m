I might be missing something, but couldn't you structure the addressable
endpoints in a way that encode the physical function as a parent / child
relation?

> +Driver Modules
> +==============
> +
> +xrt-lib.ko
> +----------
> +
> +Repository of all subsystem drivers and pure software modules that can potentially
> +be shared between xmgmt and xuser. All these drivers are structured as Linux
> +*platform driver* and are instantiated by xmgmt (or xuser in future) based on meta
> +data associated with hardware. The metadata is in the form of device tree as
> +explained before.
> +
> +xmgmt.ko
> +--------
> +
> +The xmgmt driver is a PCIe device driver driving MPF found on Xilinx's Alveo
> +PCIE device. It consists of one *root* driver, one or more *partition* drivers
> +and one or more *leaf* drivers. The root and MPF specific leaf drivers are in
> +xmgmt.ko. The partition driver and other leaf drivers are in xrt-lib.ko.
> +
> +The instantiation of specific partition driver or leaf driver is completely data
> +driven based on meta data (mostly in device tree format) found through VSEC
> +capability and inside firmware files, such as xsabin or xclbin file. The root
> +driver manages life cycle of multiple partition drivers, which, in turn, manages
> +multiple leaf drivers. This allows a single set of driver code to support all
> +kinds of subsystems exposed by different shells. The difference among all
> +these subsystems will be handled in leaf drivers with root and partition drivers
> +being part of the infrastructure and provide common services for all leaves found
> +on all platforms.
> +
> +
> +xmgmt-root
> +^^^^^^^^^^
> +
> +The xmgmt-root driver is a PCIe device driver attaches to MPF. It's part of the
Nit: s/attaches/attached ?
> +infrastructure of the MPF driver and resides in xmgmt.ko. This driver
> +
> +* manages one or more partition drivers
> +* provides access to functionalities that requires pci_dev, such as PCIE config
> +  space access, to other leaf drivers through parent calls
> +* together with partition driver, facilities event callbacks for other leaf drivers
> +* together with partition driver, facilities inter-leaf driver calls for other leaf
> +  drivers
> +
> +When root driver starts, it will explicitly create an initial partition instance,
> +which contains leaf drivers that will trigger the creation of other partition
> +instances. The root driver will wait for all partitions and leaves to be created
> +before it returns from it's probe routine and claim success of the initialization
> +of the entire xmgmt driver.
> +
> +partition
> +^^^^^^^^^
> +
> +The partition driver is a platform device driver whose life cycle is managed by
> +root and does not have real IO mem or IRQ resources. It's part of the
> +infrastructure of the MPF driver and resides in xrt-lib.ko. This driver
> +
> +* manages one or more leaf drivers so that multiple leaves can be managed as a group
> +* provides access to root from leaves, so that parent calls, event notifications
> +  and inter-leaf calls can happen
> +
> +In xmgmt, an initial partition driver instance will be created by root, which
> +contains leaves that will trigger partition instances to be created to manage
> +groups of leaves found on different partitions on hardware, such as VSEC, Shell,
> +and User.
> +
> +leaves
> +^^^^^^
> +
> +The leaf driver is a platform device driver whose life cycle is managed by
> +a partition driver and may or may not have real IO mem or IRQ resources. They
> +are the real meat of xmgmt and contains platform specific code to Shell and User
> +found on a MPF.
> +
> +A leaf driver may not have real hardware resources when it merely acts as a driver
> +that manages certain in-memory states for xmgmt. These in-memory states could be
> +shared by multiple other leaves.
> +
> +Leaf drivers assigned to specific hardware resources drive specific subsystem in
> +the device. To manipulate the subsystem or carry out a task, a leaf driver may ask
> +help from root via parent calls and/or from other leaves via inter-leaf calls.
> +
> +A leaf can also broadcast events through infrastructure code for other leaves
> +to process. It can also receive event notification from infrastructure about certain
> +events, such as post-creation or pre-exit of a particular leaf.

> +=================

> +xmgmt Driver Ioctls
> +-------------------
> +
> +Ioctls exposed by xmgmt driver to user space are enumerated in the following table:

> +xmgmt Driver Sysfs
> +------------------
> +
> +xmgmt driver exposes a rich set of sysfs interfaces. Subsystem platform drivers
> +export sysfs node for every platform instance.
> +
> +Every partition also exports its UUIDs. See below for examples::
> +
> +  /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:06:00.0/xmgmt_main.0/interface_uuids

> +
> +hwmon
> +-----
> +
> +xmgmt driver exposes standard hwmon interface to report voltage, current, temperature,
> +power, etc. These can easily be viewed using *sensors* command line utility.
> +
> +
> +mailbox
> +-------
> +
> +xmgmt communicates with user physical function driver via HW mailbox. Mailbox opcodes
> +are defined in ``mailbox_proto.h``. `Mailbox Inter-domain Communication Protocol
> +<https://xilinx.github.io/XRT/master/html/mailbox.proto.html>`_ defines the full
> +specification. xmgmt implements subset of the specification. It provides the following
> +services to the UPF driver:
> +
> +1.  Responding to *are you there* request including determining if the two drivers are
> +    running in the same OS domain
> +2.  Provide sensor readings, loaded xclbin UUID, clock frequency, shell information, etc.
> +3.  Perform PCIe hot reset
> +4.  Download user compiled xclbin

Is this gonna use the mailbox framework?
