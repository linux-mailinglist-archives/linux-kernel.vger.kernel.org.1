Thanks for the review. I think overlap would be OK in this case and the 
check should be skipped.

Right, especially on 32 bit systems this could be a real problem. I have 
limited the stack for tasks in the whole system to 2MB without problems 
(most use only 128kB) and on 48 bit virtual address systems the 
collision to 2MB area could be roughly 1/2^(48-21) which is a very small 
number. But perhaps this should be still be avoided by not picking an 
address too close to bottom of stack, say 64MB to be sure. It may also 
make this more useful also for 32 bit systems but overall I'm not so 
optimistic due to increased fragmentation.

Maybe a different address could be tried (but not infinitely, say 5 
times) and then fall back to classics. This would not be good for the 
ASLR but I haven't seen mremap() to be used much in my tests.

This would reduce the randomization which I want to avoid. I think the 
extra overhead should be OK: if this is unacceptable for a workload or 
system constraints, don't use mode '3' but '2'.

Instead of single global sysctl, this could be implemented as a new 
personality (or make this model the default and add a compatibility 
personality with no or less randomization), so it could be applied only 
for some tasks but not all.
