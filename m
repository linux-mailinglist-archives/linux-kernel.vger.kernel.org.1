I am also of Vlad's opinion. It seems to me that doing the migrate_disable()
before dropping the raw spinlock should suffice.

Note that in the future, we may have other users of this path such as
a potential kmem_cache_free_rcu(). It seems burdensome to make these all
callable only from sleepable-context.

Is there a drawback of doing migrate_disable before dropping the raw internal
lock, that I'm missing?
