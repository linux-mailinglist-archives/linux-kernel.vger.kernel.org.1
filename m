OK, this is a much more useful description of the problem, thank you!

I can think of two possibilities here.  One is that maybe our readahead
heuristics just don't work on modern phone hardware.  Perhaps we need
to ramp up more aggressively by default.

The other is that maybe it really is just a "boost at startup" kind
of situation and so we should support _that_.  Some interface where
we can set a ra_boost, and then do:

	if (ra_boost)
		newsize *= 2;

in get_init_ra_size().
