That's fine, but why is it the Linux kernel's job to fix up this mess?

There is already a userspace tool that can be run to resolve this for
devices that wish to have this fixed up for.  Use that.  We want to keep
things that can be done in userspace, in userspace, whenever possible.

And again, Linux runs just fine with these devices so why is it Linux's

I'm with Johan here, reprogramming eeproms when people least expect it
is not nice, and in a way, is much the same thing that the Windows
drivers are doing.
