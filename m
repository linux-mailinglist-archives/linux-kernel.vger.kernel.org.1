And don't look now, but my current intermediate state seems to make the
following splat happen semi-reliably from within rcutorture when running
scenario TREE01 with "--kconfig "CONFIG_RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD=y".
The current changes cause this scenario to process more than double the
number of RCU grace periods per unit time, so who knows?

I am not reporting this one yet because it is of course quite possible
that it is due to my changes being messed up.

							Thanx, Paul
