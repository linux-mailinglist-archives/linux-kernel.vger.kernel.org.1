Hi Yilun,

You raise some very interesting questions. Please see
my comments below.

I think you mean power cycle when you say "rebooting system" above, but
your point is worth highlighting.  During this flash update the
FPGA is actually fully configured and running its application.  Typically,
during a fpga-mgr update of the static region or partial reconfiguration
region, the actual contents of the fpga region is "changing" during the 
update.

When an fpga-mgr is used in a device tree overlay flow, one gains
the benefit the enumeration of the nodes in the overlay after the
update has completed.

Yes, on those cards that have the ability to power cycle themselves (i.e. 
fully reconfigure the FPGA from flash), the PCIe connection to the card
is broken because of a surprise link down PCIe error.  As you say a PCI 
rescan (i.e. re-enumeration of the entire card) is required.  Since
the card has to be re-scanned at the PCI level anyway, there may not be 
much benefit to using the fpga-mgr in this flow.

I wonder if these kinds of more disruptive updates are better suited to 
something firmware updates rather than fpga updates?
