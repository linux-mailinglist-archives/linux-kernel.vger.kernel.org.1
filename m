So, during a CPU round, the nocb-gp kthread locks the corresponding rdp-nocb
and then ignores if it is not offloaded. Surely there is a smarter ways to do
that though. Well that's something we'll need to optimize at some point anyway.

Also we must then make sure that the nocb timers won't ever fire while we
switch to offloaded state or they may fiddle with internals without locking
nocb.

Perhaps partly but I fear that won't be enough.

Yeah but the cost is more complicated code and synchronization to
maintain the use of those all-in-one locking APIs everywhere. And
current state is already not that simple :-)

Perhaps we should rename rcu_nocb_lock() into rcu_nocb_lock_cond() to
prevent from accidents?

Also I've been thinking that rcu_nocb_lock() should meet any of these
requirements:

* hotplug is locked
* rcu barrier is locked
* rnp is locked

Because checking the offloaded state (when nocb isn't locked yet) of
an rdp without any of the above locks held is racy. And that should
be easy to check and prevent from copy-pasta accidents.

What do you think?
