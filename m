Let's hope this one works:

https://www.armlinux.org.uk/developer/patches/viewpatch.php?id=8997/1

I re-tested it and it also matches how the conflict was resolved in
the Chrome OS tree which means that (once the stable merge lands in
our tree) this conflict resolution will get a bit of testing, though
the vast majority of devices running this code have since stopped
receiving auto updates.
