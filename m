I think drm-misc is the right place then.

Please send a v6 with the following changes:
- drop the component framework patch
- drop the i.MX8MQ DT patch, this should go through Shawn's imx tree
after the driver and binding has landed in drm-misc
- you can add my Reviewed-by to the whole series or I can add it when
applying
- add a MAINTAINERS entry, please add me as a reviewer if you don't
mind

I can push this initial series into drm-misc until you've got your own
commit rights.

Regards,
Lucas
