Yup! As above I do this today for building test kernels I run on a
number of different hosts, and I'm aware of other use-cases (e.g. WSL2
or docker for mac) where you may want to do this to minimize the core
kernel either for size or security reasons.

Indeed ;)

For cases where a malicious guest could cause harm we've added
workarounds in KVM, so unless we've missed something that shouldn't be
the case.

Otherwise, a guest missing these is just shooting itself in the foot.

IIRC platform device passthrough requires an corresponding VFIO platform
driver in the host to handle reset and so on, but it does seem a shame
to not allow the user to select a driver if they really want it.

I guess there might be platform-specific PCIe drivers too, which might
work with VFIO regardless.

Thanks,
Mark.
