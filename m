Subject: [PATCH] driver core: Drop mention of obsolete bus rwsem from
 kernel-doc
To:     Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Cc:     "Rafael J. Wysocki" <rafael@kernel.org>,
        linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

15 years ago, commit 6eded061b126 ("Fix up bus code and remove use of
rwsem") removed the bus rwsem, but left over a reference to it in a
kernel-doc comment.  Drop it.
