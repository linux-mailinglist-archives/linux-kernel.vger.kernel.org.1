I work for Intel ;-)

It is definitely incorrect. They are completely different things.

Ideally there is one driver per device. Otherwise we end up issues when
the device appears and there are several to choose from, which one to
pick.

If this is touching the 00:1f.5 PCI device (SPI-NOR controller) then the
right place is the intel-spi-pci.c as that's the driver for this
controller. We can put this there so that it does not enable the SPI-NOR
functionality itself and the mark the SPI-NOR functionality only as
being dangerous or something like that.

You sprint() there "%d\n", so that includes a number, '\n' and '\0' unless
I'm missing something.

Yup, sounds good :)

OK
