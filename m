Ok, but that's not the standard location for sysfs file documentation.

That's what partition names are for, you should never depend on a
"random number".

No, please use a partition name, that is the only way to always know you
are mounting the correct partition.  You have created a random number
here that might, or might not, change between boots depending on the
order of the filesystem being mounted.  It is not persistant or
deterministic at all, please do not treat it as such.

Again, the point is that a filesystem type is not unique, this, if
really really needed, should be an attribute for ALL filesystem types,
f2fs is not special here at all.

Please do not rely on this number ever being the same across boots,
because your code is such that you can not guarantee that.

And again, if you really want to know the partition you are mounting
really is the partition you think you are mounting, use the partition
label name, that is what it is there for, and is why we have been
relying on that for decades.  A new special per-filesystem-attribute
that is semi-random is not the correct solution for the problem you are
describing as far as I can determine.
