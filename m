I tried to bisec, but it didn't yield something useful yet. The outcome
was commit

	commit 1abdfe706a579a702799fce465bceb9fb01d407c
	Author: Alex Belits <abelits@marvell.com>
	Date:   Thu Jun 25 18:34:41 2020 -0400

	    lib: Restrict cpumask_local_spread to houskeeping CPUs

But it looks totally unrelated to the backtrace I am seeing, and
reverting it didn't fix the problem.

Next thing is, I can reliable reproduce it with yesterdays tip/master
(commit 16f70beccf43), but did not see it with tip/master pulled today
(commit c02699cd25e8) yet.

To trigger it is sufficient to run the test_syscall_vdso_32 self-test in
a loop, ideally multiple $times, where $times > `nproc`. It usually
triggers withing the first 5 minutes in my test VMs. It turned out that
a running perf is not needed to trigger it.
