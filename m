I need to start from the original patch in order to preserve its
authorship.

My plan is to work with the iommu subsystem maintainers after
have this (and another pending patch series for DRM) merged.

This series make this driver working as expected.

I mean, while patch 01/16 is against Kernel 4.9, the other patches
on this series ports it to upstream, cleans up the driver and
address several issues on it.

This specific IOMMU seems to be an specific part of the SoC dedicated for 
the display engine and by the encoding/decoding images via the ISP. 
With this series, this driver builds and runs as expected, providing
IOMMU support needed by the upcoming KMS/DRM driver.

The only issue on it (as far as I can tell) is that the DT bindings
require some work, as, instead of using dma-ranges, the DRM driver binds
into it with:

	smmu_lpae {
                 compatible = "hisilicon,smmu-lpae";
         };

         dpe: dpe@e8600000 {
                 compatible = "hisilicon,kirin970-dpe";
...
                 iommu_info {
                         start-addr = <0x8000>;
                         size = <0xbfff8000>;
                 };
         };

In order to properly address it, the best would be to also have the
DRM driver merged upstream, as it relies on it. So, a change in DT will 
also mean a change at the way the DRM uses it.

The DRM itself should go via staging, as it has some bugs that I'd
like to fix before moving it to drivers/gpu/drm. Those are more
tricky to solve, as they seem to require using different settings for 
some hardware registers, and the downstream driver also have the same 
issues. Fixing them will likely require some time.

Thanks,
Mauro
