LOL, WHAT?

I didn't know shared blocks applied to fs metadata.  I thought that
"shared" only applied to file extent maps being able to share physical
blocks.

Could /somebody/ please document the ondisk format changes that are
associated with this feature?

All 1s?  So the inode bitmap says that every inode table slot is in use,
even if the inode record itself says it isn't?  What does e2fsck -n
think about that kind of metadata inconsistency?

Hmm, let's try.

$ truncate -s 300m /tmp/a.img
$ mke2fs -T ext4 -O shared_blocks /tmp/a.img -d /tmp/ -F
mke2fs 1.46~WIP-2020-10-04 (4-Oct-2020)
Invalid filesystem option set: shared_blocks

Oookay.  So that's not how you create these shared block ext4s,
apparently...

$ mke2fs -T ext4 /tmp/a.img -F

Ok, now we have a shared blocks fs where BG 0 and BG 1 share bitmaps,
and the bitmaps are set to 1.

$ e2fsck -n /tmp/a.img

Sooooo... are you shipping ext4 images with an undocumented ondisk
format variation that looks like inconsistency to the standard tools?
