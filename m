What we've discussed on irc is that the hand-rolled version is apparently
a bit better (but not perfect, since indeed this isn't possible without
-rt). I think we need to look more into whether that difference is real,
and why exactly it happens. From a quick look our hand-rolled worker and
kthread_worker have identical code ...

I don't think we absolutely have to do this, simply means some nested
irq-safe spinlock. One in vblank_work, other in kthread_worker. Since the
delayed work doesn't do that I think it'd be nice if the drm_vblank
(instead of timer) delayed work could use the same pattern.
