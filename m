This:

concurrent smp_call_function_single_async() using the same csd is what
I'm looking at as well. Now in the ILB case there is an easy cure:

(because there is only a single ilb target)

diff --git a/kernel/sched/fair.c b/kernel/sched/fair.c

Qian, can you give that a spin?

But I'm still not convinced of your scenario:

Note that we check the return value of atomic_fetch_or() and bail if
someone else set a flag in KICK_MASK before us.

Aah, I suppose you're saying this can happen when:

  !(flags & NOHZ_KICK_MASK)

? That's not supposed to happen though.


Anyway, let me go stare at the remove wake-up case, because i'm afraid
that might have the same problem too...
