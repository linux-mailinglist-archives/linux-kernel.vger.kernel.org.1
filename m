Hi Logan,

Thanks for the bug report.  (Sorry I missed the first one, Naresh.)

The problem is that ret_from_fork() is no longer in .entry.text, so the
following check in the FP unwinder doesn't work when ret_from_fork()
gets interrupted.

	/*
	 * Don't warn if the unwinder got lost due to an interrupt in entry
	 * code or in the C handler before the first frame pointer got set up:
	 */
	if (state->got_irq && in_entry_code(state->ip))
		goto the_end;

If you have the ability to recreate, can you try the following patch?

A combination of a lot of forks and a lot of interrupts should trigger
it.  I'll try to recreate as well.
