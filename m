I think you might be missing my point. What I was getting at is that I
know for performance testing sometimes C states and P states get
disabled in order to get consistent results between runs, it sounds
like you have them enabled though. I was just wondering if you had
disabled them or not. If they were disabled then you wouldn't get the
benefits of turbo and as such adding more cores wouldn't come at a
penalty, while with it enabled the first few cores should start to
slow down as they fell out of turbo mode. So it may be part of the
reason why you are only hitting about 10x at full core count.

As it stands I think your code may speed up a bit if you split the
work up based on section instead of max order. That would get rid of
any cache bouncing you may be doing on the pageblock flags and reduce
the overhead for splitting the work up into individual pieces since
each piece will be bigger.
