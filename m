There are two "free" operations we need to perform with respect to ima 
buffer on kexec:

1, The ima_free_kexec_buffer() called from ima_load_kexec_buffer() - the 
one you have stated above.

Here we remove the "ima buffer" node from the "OF" tree and free the 
memory pages that were allocated for the measurement list.

This one is already present in ima and there's no change in that in my 
patches.

2, The other one is remove_ima_kexec_buffer() called from 
setup_ima_buffer() defined in "arch/powerpc/kexec/ima.c"

  This function removes the "ima buffer" node from the "FDT" and also 
frees the physical memory reserved for the "ima measurement list" by the 
previous kernel.

  This "free" operation needs to be performed even if the current kernel 
does not support IMA kexec since the previous kernel could have passed 
the IMA measurement list (in FDT and reserved physical memory).

For this reason, remove_ima_kexec_buffer() cannot be defined in "ima" 
but some other place which will be built even if ima is not enabled. I 
chose to define this function in "kernel" since that is guaranteed to be 
always built.
