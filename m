Yeah I understand what you meant but I was just trying to highlight
additional benefits that sysrq from NMI provides.

Yes I understand these concerns as well. That's why I have tried to
defer almost all of the work to the IRQ work queue apart from
essential parsing of RX chars in NMI mode. Also, I tried to keep most
of this code common in serial core.

The current patch-set only makes this NMI to work when debugger (kgdb)
is enabled which I think is mostly suitable for development
environments. So most people testing will involve existing IRQ mode
only.

However, it's very much possible to make NMI mode as default for a
particular serial driver if the underlying irqchip supports it but it
depends if we really see any production level usage of NMI debug
feature.

Yes we can reroute serial interrupts but what I meant to say is that
we can at most get a backtrace of CPU stuck in hard-lockup whereas
with NMI debugger entry on hard-lockup CPU, we can do normal
start/stop/single-step debugging on that CPU.

Are you proposing to have complete RX operation in polling mode with
RX interrupt disabled (eg. using a kernel thread)?

Yes, the sysrq handlers which aren't NMI safe will behave similarly to
existing IRQ based sysrq handlers.

It looks like polling would cause much CPU overhead. So I am not sure
if that is the preferred approach.
