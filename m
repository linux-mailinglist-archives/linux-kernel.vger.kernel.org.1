I see.  How about I move another small step further to cover GUP (to be
explicit, faultin_page() and fixup_user_fault())?

GUP needs the per-task accounting, but not the perf events.  We can do that by
slightly changing the new approach into:

        bool major = (ret & VM_FAULT_MAJOR) || (flags & FAULT_FLAG_TRIED);

        if (major)
                current->maj_flt++;
        else
                current->min_flt++;

        if (!regs)
                return ret;

        if (major)
                perf_sw_event(PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS_MAJ, 1, regs, address);
        else
                perf_sw_event(PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS_MIN, 1, regs, address);

With the change we will always account that onto current task.  Since there're
GUP calls that are not even accounted at all, e.g., get_user_pages_remote()
with tsk==NULL: for these calls, we also account these page faults onto current
task.

Another major benefit I can see (besides a completely cleaned up accounting) is
that we can remove the task_struct pointer in the whole GUP code, because
AFAICT that's only used for this pf accounting either in faultin_page() or
fixup_user_fault(), which seems questionable itself now to not use current...

Any opinions?

Thanks,
