Hmm, I think this is another case where we need to separate out the
page-table walker attributes from the access attributes. Currently,
IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_ARM_OUTER_WBWA applies _only_ to the page-table walker
and I don't think it makes any sense for that to be per-buffer (how would
you even manage that?). However, if we want to extend this to data accesses
and we know that there are valid use-cases where this should be per-buffer,
then shoe-horning it in with the walker quirk does not feel like the best
thing to do.

As a starting point, we could:

  1. Rename IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_ARM_OUTER_WBWA to IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_PTW_LLC
  2. Add a new prot flag IOMMU_LLC
  3. Have the GPU pass the new prot for its buffer mappings

Does that work? One thing I'm not sure about is whether IOMMU_CACHE should
imply IOMMU_LLC, or whether there is a use-case for inner-cacheable, outer
non-cacheable mappings for a coherent device. Have you ever seen that sort
of thing before?

Will
