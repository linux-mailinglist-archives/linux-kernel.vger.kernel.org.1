Yes.

It already does to some extent. IIRC, there's a mode to extract email
addresses from files.

I was hoping that the MAINTAINERS file split happens sometime and we
can just generate a MAINTAINERS file for bindings.

Yeah, I should fix my bug.

I don't see checkpatch being able to check much of what comes up in
review. Maybe indentation.

700 vs. 3000 currently. It's about 60-70 new bindings and ~100
conversions per cycle. At this point we're review limited I think and
at the current rate, we should be done in 7 years. Yay! :( We need a
faster way.
