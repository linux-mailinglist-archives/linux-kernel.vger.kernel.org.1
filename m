These are the typos found in scripts/spelling.txt for
most of the Documentation/ tree.

Scripted with:

$ cat scripts/spelling.txt | \
  grep -v -P "^\s*\#" | \
  while read line ; do \
    from=$(echo $line | cut -f1 -d'|'); \
    to=$(echo $line | cut -f3 -d'|'); \
    echo "from: $from to: $to" ; \
    git grep -w --name-only $from | \
    xargs sed -i "s/\b$from\b/$to/" ; \
    git checkout scripts/spelling.txt ; \
  done

And some removal of inappropriate conversions
in Documentation/translations and a few files
where the conversions were incorrect.
