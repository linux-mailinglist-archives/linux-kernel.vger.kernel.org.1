Ok. I wasn't aware of that.

I tested the regex with regex101.org and only tested with patches that 
trigger the checkpatch.pl test, and it worked fine for me.
I didn't test with string with trailing \n, that should NOT trigger the 
test. I should have! :(

Agreed but your perl and regex is much more fluent than mine. ;-)
