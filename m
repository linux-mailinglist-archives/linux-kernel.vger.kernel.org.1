If rq is NULL you return -1, an error the way I read it. rq is passed as an
argument, so better ensure we handle NULL and not blindly dereference rq and
crash.

struct rq is defined in kernel/sched/sched.h. It's not exported. Exporting
these helper functions was the agreement to help modules trace internal info.
By passing generic info you decouple the tracepoint from giving specific info
and allow the modules to extract all the info they need from the same
tracepoint. IE: if you need more than just cpu_capacity from this tracepoint,
you can get that without having to continuously add extra arguments everytime
you need an extra piece of info. Unless this info is not in the rq of course.

The problem is that you need to export struct rq in a public header. Which we
don't want to do. I have been trying to find out how to use BTF so we can
remove these functions. Haven't gotten far away yet - but it should be doable
and it's a question of me finding enough time to understand what was currently
done and if I can re-use something or need to come up with extra infrastructure
first.
