Excellent, that's of course much better than just capping to 0.

Gave it a try and had to wait overnight for things to cool down
(just suspending for an hour wouldn't do it). Right after wakeup sensors
now shows "N/A" as expected, and no illegal values in drivetemp or my
monitoring; missing values are perfectly fine.
After a few minutes correct values show up and all is good.

In case you submit this as official patch feel free to add my
Reported-by/Tested-by. Thanks for looking into it!

cheers
