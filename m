Two thoughts:

1. Most (all?) alloc_contig_range() users are interested in handling
short-term pinnings in a nice way (IOW, make the allocation succeed).
I'd much rather want to see this being handled in a nice fashion inside
alloc_contig_range() than having to encode endless loops in the caller.
This means I strongly prefer something like [3] if feasible. But I can
understand that stuff ([5]) is complicated. I have to admit that I am
not an expert on the short term pinning described by you, and how to
eventually fix it.

2. The issue that I am having is that long-term pinnings are
(unfortunately) a real thing. It's not something to debug and fix as you
suggest. Like, run a VM with VFIO (e.g., PCI passthrough). While that VM
is running, all VM memory will be pinned. If memory falls onto a CMA
region your cma_alloc() will be stuck in an (endless, meaning until the
VM ended) loop. I am not sure if all cma users are fine with that -
especially, think about CMA being used for gigantic pages now.

Assume you want to start a new VM while the other one is running and use
some (new) gigantic pages for it. Suddenly you're trapped in an endless
loop in the kernel. That's nasty.

We do have a similar endless loop on the memory hotunplug/offlining path
(offline_pages()). However, if triggered by a user (echo 0 >
/sys/devices/system/memory/memoryX/online), a user can stop trying by
sending a signal.


If we want to stick to retrying forever, can't we use flags like
__GFP_NOFAIL to explicitly enable this new behavior for selected
cma_alloc() users that really can't fail/retry manually again?

David / dhildenb
