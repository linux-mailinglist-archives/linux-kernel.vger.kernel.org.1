Yes, they are effective at hitting corner cases and that is fine. I
am not dismissing their usefulness. I have tried to explain that many
times but let me try again. Seeing a corner case and think about a
potential fix is one thing. On the other hand it is not really ideal to
treat such a failure a hard regression and consider otherwise useful
functionality/improvement to be reverted without a proper cost benefit
analysis. Sure having corner cases is not really nice but really, look
at this example again. Overcommit setting is a global thing, it is hard
to change it during runtime nilly willy. Because that might have really
detrimental side effects on all workloads running. So it is quite
reasonable to expect that this is either early after the boot or when
the system is in quiescent state when almost nothing but very core
services are running and likelihood that the mode of operation changes.

Me neither and I am not claiming that. All I am saying is that a real
risk of a regression is reasonably low that I wouldn't lose sleep over
that. It is perfectly fine to address this pro-actively if the fix is
reasonably maintainable. I was mostly reacting to your pushing for a
revert solely based on LTP results.

LTP is a very useful tool to raise awareness of potential problems but
you shouldn't really follow those results just blindly.

I am all for clarifications in the documentation.
