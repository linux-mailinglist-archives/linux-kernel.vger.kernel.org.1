Yikes, I need to check specification again for this. I will also
check with the firmware implementation team/

But that may get fatal the result in some other cases, not here for sure.
But I would rather flag that as error so that it is fixed. Anyways I will
check on this again/

Not really, there are couple more I think now. But yes I need to check
on the generic return part.

I prefer that. Anyways I will check and if anything changes I will ping
back on this thread.
