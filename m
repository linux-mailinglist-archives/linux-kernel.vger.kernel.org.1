A virtio interface being one between host and guest is inherently
asymmetric. The whole innovation of the VOP design was to treat Linux on a
PCIe device as a guest, there was even talk at some point of the "guest"
being managed via libvirt. So here host and guest retain their specific
role/personality. The host "inserts" devices which appear in the guest
e.g. So I am not sure how this asymmetry plays in the scenarios mentioned
above.
