Yes, that is correct.  There isn't a collision since I2C uses 0-0000 and
SPMI uses 0-00 naming scheme.  However, those names are very similar and
it is hard for a user to tell which is which inside
/sys/kernel/debug/regmap without a deep understanding of the I2C and SPMI
code.

The SPMI regmap debugfs files are used extensively for testing and debug
purposes internally at Qualcomm and by our customers.  It would be helpful
if the more verbose naming scheme were accepted upstream to avoid
confusion and broken test scripts.

Thanks,
David
