Its not as easy as the CPU PMU for virtualizing the ETMs (with memory
mapped access only), i.e supporting ETMs from VMs.
We could definitely stop/resume on guest entry/exit, to support 
attr.exclude_guest.

I don't think Guest Context is something we can support as mentioned
above, at least for systems without sysreg access for ETMs (and 
virtualizing ETRs is a different story !)
