Sometimes even the disk is full, the issue still does not reproduced that above two time exceed a certain threshold.  So I added two trace points, using filter we can only record the abnormal trace that includes wakeup latency and leaving running time larger than an threshold.

In practice, this is what ends up being required. FYI, perf probe is handy
for creating a tracepoint in an arbitrary location. If BPF is not an option
(e.g. older kernel where BPF cannot do what you want or newer kernel
where BPF has regressed in some way) then systemtap is the other option.

Which sucks on its own. The other problem is that you cannot trace older
kernels that do not have the updated tracepoints so it's worth at least
pointing out what the options are. In general, trying to accumulate
state inside a tracepoint is a curse because changes in the internal
implementation can render the tracepoint redundant, or worse, misleading.
It *can* be an option when developing a patch and you want detailed
trace information to guide development but be prepared to throw away the
tracepoints before submitting.

If state is to be accumulated between multiple tracepoints then the
primary options are BPF, systemtap, trace-cmd for offline analysis or
opening trace_pipe with a script, parsing the events and accumulate the
state that way. This can lead to a concern that the script must be running
from system start to track the data and yes, this is exactly what you
have to do.  It's not that different to having to monitor /proc/vmstat
over time to get some interesting vm stats as the accumulated state since
the system started is often useless.

Online analysis of trace_pipe is the most expensive for a lot of reasons
but it has the advantage of almost always working regardless of kernel
version as long as the script interprets the tracepoints correctly. It
may be too expensive for production but it's useful when figuring out
what tracepoints are needed and how that state should be accumulated.
