This is an abuse of the power-domains binding and a complete hack, so
no. The wifi part should be a child node on the PCI bus. That's the
only acceptable solution for DT.

Obviously there's a probe chicken and egg problem for Linux, but for
DT it doesn't matter. You have 2 options. You can fix PCIe to force
probe devices with a DT node (and lots of folks would appreciate it
because you aren't the only one needing it). If there's a DT node,
then you know there is a device there. This is what MDIO bus does. Or
you can keep your misc driver, but it needs to go find the PCIe child
node itself. IOW, you have to create the platform device yourself in
the initcall rather than rely on the DT code to create one.

Personally, I wouldn't accept the 2nd solution as I think it is still
a hack, but I won't object.
