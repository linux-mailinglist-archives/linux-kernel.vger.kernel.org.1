If we can have something close to the numbers you shared, it seems to be
good for us.  Using the thunk instead of a signal seems very interesting
for performance.

Though, I'm not convinced about this not being part of seccomp just
because it is not security.  The suggestion from Kees to convert
seccomp to eBPF filters and stack them would provide similar semantics
and reuse the infrastructure.

Finnaly, as you said, I'm afraid that eBPF will be a show stopper,
unless unpriviledged eBPF becomes a thing. Wine cannot count on
CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
