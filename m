Yes, we can run into this situation in DL, but also in CFS or RT.

IMHO, this patch is aligned with the Capacity Awareness implementation
in CFS and RT.

Capacity Awareness so far is 'find a CPU which fits the requirement of
the task (Req)'. It's not (yet) find the best CPU.

CFS - select_idle_capacity() -> task_fits_capacity()

      Req: util(p) * 1.25 < capacity_of(cpu)

RT  - select_task_rq_rt(), cpupri_find_fitness() ->
      rt_task_fits_capacity()

      Req: uclamp_eff_value(p) <= capacity_orig_of(cpu)

DL  - select_task_rq_dl(), cpudl_find() -> dl_task_fits_capacity()

      Req: dl_runtime(p)/dl_deadline(p) * 1024  <= capacity_orig_of(cpu)


There has to be an "idle" (from the viewpoint of the task) CPU available
with a fitting capacity. Otherwise a fallback mechanism applies.

CFS - best capacity handling in select_idle_capacity().

RT  - Non-fitting lowest mask

DL  - This patch

You did spot the rt-app 'delay' for the small tasks in the test case ;-)
