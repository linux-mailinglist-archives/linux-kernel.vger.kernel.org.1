In ChromeOS we are considering all cookie-0 tasks as trusted.
Basically if you don't trust a task, then that is when you assign the
task a tag. We do this for the sandboxed processes.

Is the uperf throughput worse with SMT+core-scheduling versus no-SMT ?

thanks,

PS: I am planning to write a patch behind a CONFIG option that tags
all processes (default untrusted) so everything gets a cookie which
some folks said was how they wanted (have a whitelist instead of
blacklist).
