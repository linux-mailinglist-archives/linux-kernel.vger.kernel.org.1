But then if other drivers depend just on LITEX, it would not automatically
mean that the LITEX_SOC_CONTROLLER is selected, right?. And if it's not selected
litex_{g,s}et_reg() are not available and the compilation would fail.

I could move the implementation of those functions directly to the
litex.h header
and avoid this KConfig dependency, but I'm not sure if they are not
too big to become a static inline.
What do you think?

It's not - you are correct. I will rephrase it to "extending the logic

Since the amount of possible `reg_size` is practically limited we could
add explicit 8/32/64/128 accessors to eliminate loops.
As for multiple writel/readl I don't really see an option to avoid
them for the 8-bit bus width.

Do you have any suggestions on how to handle this?
Dropping locks could lead to the situation when two cores write at the
same time leaving a wrong (mixed) value in the CSR.

On UART most probably not, as broken CSRs mean broken UART driver as well.
But I believe you can retrieve logs from the memory and analyze them
post-mortem, isn't that right?

Right, this check is not necessary - I will remove it.

You are right - in both cases (read/write) we call panic before
returning a non-0 value from litex_check_csr_access().
In this context additional WARN is probably not necessary. I'll extend
the panic message to indicate that read/write failure means a broken
system and drop this WARN.

Yes, this is an interesting point.
We have already covered it in some previous version of the patchset by testing
if the LiteX SoC Controller driver was probed and returning -EDEFER in
the UART driver otherwise
(to make sure CSR access is verified before UART uses it).
With this approach, however, all future LiteX drivers would have to
follow the pattern and we would require the LiteX SoC Controller
to be part of the system (which is not the case for the Microwatt
platform for example - it uses just an eth core from LiteX).

That's why we finally decided to go with the relaxed version - where
we allow the SoC controller driver not to be the first LiteX driver to
be probed (and possibly detect a problem after other drivers encounter
it).

Yes, this is definitely doable.
