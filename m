Yeah, but all of that happens before we actually need to do anything
with the accumulated credential information from the prepare_binprm()
calls. We can probably move the unsafe calculation and a new LSM hook
into flush_old_exec(), right before de_thread().

The idea is to ensure that once we're through check_unsafe_exec() and
have computed our LSM_UNSAFE_* flags, another thread that's still
running must not be able to fork() off a child with CLONE_FS, because
having an fs_struct that's shared with anything other than sibling
threads (which will be killed off) is supposed to only be possible if
LSM_UNSAFE_SHARE is set. So:

If check_unsafe_exec() can match each reference in the refcount
->fs->users with a reference from a sibling thread (iow the fs_struct
is not currently shared with another task), it sets p->fs->in_exec.

If another thread tries to clone(CLONE_FS) while we're in execve(),
copy_fs() will throw -EAGAIN. And if io_uring tries to grab a
reference to the fs_struct with the intent to use it on a kernel
worker thread (which conceptually is kinda similar to the
clone(CLONE_FS) case), that also aborts.

And then at the end of execve(), we clear the ->fs->in_exec flag again.

So this should work fine as long as we ensure that we can't have two
threads from the same process going through execve concurrently. (Or
if we actually want to support that, we could make ->in_exec a counter
instead of a flag, but really, preventing concurrent execve()s from a
multithreaded process seems saner...)

In that model, what should happen if someone tries to attach to a
process that's in execve(), but after the point of no return in
de_thread()? "Abort" after the point of no return normally means
force_sigsegv(), right?
