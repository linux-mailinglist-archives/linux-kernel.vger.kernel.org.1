Hello,

I'm sorry to note that preempt_enable_traced() is in *kernel text*, it
is *not* in trace_trampoline_protected region. So preempt_enable_traced()
can be preempted. And preempt_enable_notrace() in it checks any previous
resched requested during the trampoline. So no resched request is lost.

The idea is that "semi-automatically preempt-disable-protecting"
the trampoline. "semi" means the trampoline still needs
preempt_disable() and the beginning, and preempt_enable() at
the end after leaving trace_trampoline_preempt_protected region.
"automatically" means the region between the start ip of
trampoline and the first preempt_disable() is also protected.
This automatically protected region is IP based, which means the
code should be put in "trace_trampoline_preempt_protected".

In my previous email, "trace_trampoline_preempt_protected" is detected
by information in the "struct page". But the trampolines are often
created in module_alloc() region, if so, 13-page bitmap is sufficient
to store "is this virtual-page-frame-number in trace_trampoline?" info
for all vpfn in 1520 MB module_alloc() region. If the bitmap
is too big for some cases, we might need to use bloom filter
for the fast path. I still don't know what is the best way to control
the ip of trace_trampoline or attach info to it and to fast detect it.

Thanks,
Lai
