It'd be ideal for this inline capability to address both Ignat's and
your needs.  Given Ignat's changes _should_ enable yours (and Ignat
clarified that having reads inline is actually important) then I think it
best if you review Ignat's patch closely, rebase on it and test that it
meets your needs.

I'll wait for you to do this work so that I can get your feedback on
whether Ignat's changes look good for you too.  We have some time before
the 5.9 merge window opens, lets just keep the communication going and
make sure what we send upstream addresses everyone's needs and concerns.

Thanks,
Mike
