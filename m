Yes this sucks. But this is something that we likely really want to live
with. We have to explicitly _document_ that really atomic contexts in RT
cannot use the allocator. From the past discussions we've had this is
likely the most reasonable way forward because we do not really want to
encourage anybody to do something like that and there should be ways
around that. The same is btw. true also for !RT. The allocator is not
NMI safe and while we should be able to make it compatible I am not
convinced we really want to.

Would something like this be helpful wrt documentation?
