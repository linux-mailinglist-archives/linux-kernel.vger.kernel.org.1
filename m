Perhaps it was just me getting confused, early hour Pacific Time and
whatever other excuses might apply.  But I thought that you still had
an objection to GFP_RT_SAFE based on changes in allocator semantics for
other users.

Of course, if it is just me being confused, by all means let's give this
a shot!!!

And I am plenty happy if an existing flag or set of flags (up to and
including the all-zeroes empty set) can be used in this case.
