Hi Hugh,

Thanks a lot for your help and effort! I very appreciate for this.

I guess I know this after mm-compaction-avoid-vm_bug_onpageslab-in-page_mapcount.patch
was removed.

Sorry for can't follow you for above issues. Anyway, I will send out new patchset
with the first issue fixed. and then let's discussion base on it.

Sorry, I don't know the problem of trylock_page here? Could you like to
describe it as a race?

yes, that is a bit complex. I have tried the mlock cases in selftest with
your swap&build case. They are all fine with 300 times run.
