I'm not a fan of the GFP flag approach simply because we've had cases
before where GFP flags were used in inappropriate contexts like
__GFP_MEMALLOC which led to a surprising amount of bugs, particularly
from out-of-tree drivers but also in-tree drivers. Of course, there
are limited GFP flags available too but at least the comment should
be as robust as possible. Maybe something like

 * %__GFP_NO_LOCKS attempts order-0 allocation without sleepable-locks. It
 * attempts to obtain a page without acquiring any spinlocks. This
 * should only be used in a context where the holder holds a
 * raw_spin_lock that cannot be released for the allocation request.
 * This may be necessary in PREEMPT_RT kernels where a
 * raw_spin_lock is held which does not sleep tries to acquire a
 * spin_lock that can sleep with PREEMPT_RT. This should not be
 * confused with GFP_ATOMIC contexts. Like atomic allocation
 * requests, there is no guarantee a page will be returned and
 * the caller must be able to deal with allocation failures.
 * The risk of allocation failure is higher than using GFP_ATOMIC.

It's verbose but it would be hard to misinterpret. I think we're
going to go through a period of time before people get familiar
with PREEMPT_RT-related hazards as various comments that were
true are going to be misleading for a while.

For anyone reviewing, any use of __GFP_NO_LOCKS should meet a high
standard where there is no alternative except to use the flags. i.e. a
higher standard "but I'm an important driver".
