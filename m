The patch is necessary to fix some of the issues. But I feel it is
not complete. Why is it safe earlier and not later ? I believe we are
simply reducing the chances of hitting the issue, by doing this earlier than
later. I would say we better fix all instances to make sure that the
event->owner is valid. (e.g, I can see that the for kernel events
event->owner == -1 ?)

struct task_struct *tsk = READ_ONCE(event->owner);

if (!tsk || is_kernel_event(event))
    /* skip ? */
