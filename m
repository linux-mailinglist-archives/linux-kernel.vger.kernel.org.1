I have seen some systems taking quite some time when offlining sections 
due to the migration of
the respective pages not being that smooth and having do_migrate_range 
to do some spins.
But to be fair, online_pages and offline_pages are not routines that get 
called that often, and we would be safe to assume that memory-hotplug 
operations are not constantly happening, but are rather one-offs 
operations.

I am not sure about Xen and HV, IIRC Xen was using online_pages and 
offline_pages routines to do the ballooning?

I will dive in this in the following days, thanks for the work Vlastimil
