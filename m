No, no specific user-cases I'm aware of.  The reasoning was simply an
issue[1] in the tracker created by Greg.  Basically fuse client commit
b8954e5734b3 ("client: optimize rename operation under different quota
root"), which has it's own issues[2][3] associated, triggered the
implementation of the same behaviour on the kernel client.

Anyway, I'm send the revert of dffdcd71458e ("ceph: allow rename operation
under different quota realms") in a second.
