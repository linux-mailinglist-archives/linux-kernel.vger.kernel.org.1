That sounds reasonable (still keep the relative values and scale them)
I'll get back on what those scaled numbers would look like, and try to
get some sense of why this scaling to 100 was done (like you said
I don't see any documentation on this), but I see atleast a few other non-qcom
SoCs doing this too in mainline (like rockchip/rk3399)
