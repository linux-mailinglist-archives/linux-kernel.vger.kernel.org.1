Hm, good question. AFAICS it doesn't. The compilation should work for
both of these configs. While AFAIU it is meaningful to have
(MIPS_BAIKAL_T1 && OF) only instead of making the compile test depending
on the OF as well.

On the other hand MIPS_BAIKAL_T1 indirectly selects OF. I knew about
this reverse dependency, but still preferred to signify that the driver
relies on the OF functionality to properly work. What do you think would
be the best solution in this case:
1) just drop OF, which would mean to have (MIPS_BAIKAL_T1 ||
COMPILE_TEST),
2) redefine the statement to (MIPS_BAIKAL_T1 && OF) || COMPILE_TEST ?

BTW AFAICS OF API is dummy defined if no CONFIG_OF is enabled. So there
is no need in having OF-dependency for any compile-test usecase. Right?
Do you know any case when it's required? For instance, I've found the
similar OF-based conditional statement for CLK_QORIQ,
COMMON_CLK_FIXED_MMIO and COMMON_CLK_KEYSTONE. Do you think these
configs are wrong and have to be fixed by removing the "&& OF" statement
as well?

Do you mean that in case if COMPILE_TEST is enabled only, the
drivers below shouldn't be available by default? If so then ok.
I'll use MIPS_BAIKAL_T1 here. If no, then "default y" would be more
appropriate.

Ok I'll convert it to the explicit static inline version cause' you asked it.
Personally I don't see the necessity of this here. The arithmetics is
converted to u64, which is more than enough to cover any possible
nr-value.

Ok for the same reason. In our platform 32-bit data is enough here.
Though you are right. Some NF may overflow the unsigned long ref_rate
data. I'll add the 64-bit arithmetics in this function too.

BTW I thought about 64-bits here in first place, but then I decided it
may cause the performance drop in ccu_pll_calc_factors() and in
ccu_pll_recalc_rate() so I left the unsigned long calc here.

Nice catch. readl_poll_timeout() perfectly fits here. Though the atomic
version is more appropriate, since the delays are normally small and the
method is executed in the atomic context.

Ok. Thanks for noticing this. I'll replace it with ccu_pll_calc_freq() function.

I don't need full proxy file-operations in this case. Moreover since all
fops are defined by means of DEFINE_DEBUGFS_ATTRIBUTE() the set/get
callbacks used will be automatically protected against the corresponding
files removal. See the comment to the debugfs_create_file_unsafe() for
details and commit e7e6198c6056 ("clk: tegra: dfll: Fix debugfs_simple_attr.cocci
warnings") as an example of why unsafe is appropriate here. BTW The commit
has got your SoB.

These parameters are indeed mostly useful in the driver development. But
they can be useful to diagnose the peripheral device problems like data
corruption or weird clock consumers behaviour. Moreover some of the
parameters aren't utilized by the driver like bypass and nb, but might
be theoretically useful in fixing the problems.

Anyway I do understand your concern regarding write access to these
fields. What about if I implemented the same approach as the one used in
drivers/clk/clk.c? By default the fields are exported in RO-mode.
If a developer needs to debug a clock-based problem one will need to
recompile the driver with #define CLOCK_ALLOW_WRITE_DEBUGFS macro
specified. What do you think?

Ok. I thought it was obvious, since the flag naming said by itself.
These PLLs are supposed to be left enabled even if they are unused by
any of the drivers. System bootloader makes sure that required clocks
are enabled by default like CPU and DDR PLLs. So we don't want to let
the clock subsystem to disable the PLLs if they are left unused.

Right, unsigned int, but return -1, which was supposed to be an invalid
value. (unsigned int)-1 => 0xFFFFFFFF is good portable way of setting
FFs to any int.

Anyway your solution seems better. I'll use it instead.

Ok. CPU and DDR PLLs are sources of CPU cores and DDR controller reference clocks,
which obviously shouldn't be ever gated. SATA and PCIe PLLs are the parents of
APB-bus and DDR controller AXI-bus clocks, which if gated would cause
the system being unusable too.

This was my first design of the clock flags, but then I had to create a
set of custom flags for the CCU dividers driver. That time I turned to
be at a fork either to have two sets of flags: common clock and custom
ones, or a single set of custom flags, some of which then I would
translate to the common clock flags. So I've chosen the latter solution.
I see you suggest the former. Since I was in doubt which one would be
better, I'll implement yours then.

This time I disagree. Inlining them won't gain much of the performance
benefit, while combination of weakly coherent code into a single function
will cause worse readability. In my drivers I prefer separating unrelated
or weakly related functionality from each other and creating a set of functions
with coherent code (in this case it's memory allocation for the driver private
data and registers mapping, which are only related in the order of execution).
By this approach I improve the driver code readability making it better
structured. So instead of having a pile of weakly coherent code in the probe
I have a set of work methods and their antagonists (if necessary),
which are called in the required order. Similar design I normally
prefer in callbacks, event handlers, etc, if coherent code can't be
embedded into them.

Moreover I don't see any requirement by which I would have to rearrange the
code in this case, while following my way will perfectly fit to the
kernel coding style described in Documentation/process/coding-style.rst as
"Functions should be short and sweet, and do just one thing." Sorry, I
would prefer to leave this part of the driver being structured as is.

Anyway, this part of the driver will be changed in v2 due to implementing
an alternative approach of Baikal-T1 System Controller DT node design I've
described in RFC: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/3/22/393 . According to it I
will use a syscon_node_to_regmap(parent) method to get the registers map
from the parental node instead of requesting a dedicated registers range.

It isn't needed other than to provide a custom output clock names for the
predefined set of clocks. I've seen it has been used for this purpose in
many drivers of the common clk subsystem. Is this enough to have it
supported in the driver or should I remove it anyway?

I thought it was normal to have the clock devices available as early
as possible. Especially when it comes to the system-wide PLLs and dividers.
So the question is kind of surprising for me.

Anyway in my case the platform-specific code is using the CPU PLLs rate
to get the  MIPS count/compare timer reference clock. At least due to this
the PLL clock providers must be available at the system initialization stage.
Platform device probe stage wouldn't work for us here.

Moreover we can't rely on the order of the devices probe procedure, because
the CCU PLLs and CCU dividers will be sub-nodes of the Baikal-T1 System Controller,
which will be a sub-node of the APB-bus node consuming the corresponding CCU
divider clock. The CCU PLL and divider clocks are utilized literally by each
device in the system, so there might be too many PROBE_DEFER errors before we get
to the clock devices binding with drivers.

To sum up I'd leave both PLL, AXI-bus and System device dividers
clocks being populated in the init stage by means of the CLK_OF_DECLARE
macro.

Agreed.

Stephen, thank you very much for the very thorough review. v2 will be
sent shortly after I get answers to a few question I've asked in this
message, after I fix the issues you raised here and get to refactor
the System Controller DT node design described in the RFC
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/3/22/393). Should you have any comments
regarding it please reply right to the RFC. You must have received a
copy in your email.

I'll also do my best to take into account the fixes suggested here by you
in [Patch 5/5] "clk: Add Baikal-T1 CCU dividers driver" of this
patchset.

Regards,
-Sergey
