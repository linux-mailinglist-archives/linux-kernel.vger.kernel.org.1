Subject: [PATCH v19 00/20] per memcg lru_lock

The new version rebased on v5.9-rc6 with line by line review by Hugh Dickins.
Millions thanks! And removed the 4th part from last version which do post
optimization, that we can repost after the main part get merged. About one
year coding and review, now I believe it's ready.

So now this patchset includes 3 parts:
1, some code cleanup and minimum optimization as a preparation. 
2, use TestCleanPageLRU as page isolation's precondition.
3, replace per node lru_lock with per memcg per node lru_lock.

Current lru_lock is one for each of node, pgdat->lru_lock, that guard for
lru lists, but now we had moved the lru lists into memcg for long time. Still
using per node lru_lock is clearly unscalable, pages on each of memcgs have
to compete each others for a whole lru_lock. This patchset try to use per
lruvec/memcg lru_lock to repleace per node lru lock to guard lru lists, make
it scalable for memcgs and get performance gain.

Currently lru_lock still guards both lru list and page's lru bit, that's ok.
but if we want to use specific lruvec lock on the page, we need to pin down
the page's lruvec/memcg during locking. Just taking lruvec lock first may be
undermined by the page's memcg charge/migration. To fix this problem, we could
take out the page's lru bit clear and use it as pin down action to block the
memcg changes. That's the reason for new atomic func TestClearPageLRU.
So now isolating a page need both actions: TestClearPageLRU and hold the
lru_lock.

The typical usage of this is isolate_migratepages_block() in compaction.c
we have to take lru bit before lru lock, that serialized the page isolation
in memcg page charge/migration which will change page's lruvec and new 
lru_lock in it.

The above solution suggested by Johannes Weiner, and based on his new memcg 
charge path, then have this patchset. (Hugh Dickins tested and contributed much
code from compaction fix to general code polish, thanks a lot!).

Daniel Jordan's testing show 62% improvement on modified readtwice case
on his 2P * 10 core * 2 HT broadwell box.

Thanks Hugh Dickins and Konstantin Khlebnikov, they both brought this
idea 8 years ago, and others who give comments as well: Daniel Jordan, 
Mel Gorman, Shakeel Butt, Matthew Wilcox, Alexander Duyck etc.

Thanks for Testing support from Intel 0day and Rong Chen, Fengguang Wu,
and Yun Wang. Hugh Dickins also shared his kbuild-swap case. Thanks!
