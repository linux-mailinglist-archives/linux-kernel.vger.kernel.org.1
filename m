Hi Mathieu,

Thanks for the patches. I'm trying to understand the concept of 
this approach and I'm probably failing at that. It seems to me 
that this patch set is making the NS announcement service to a 
separate RPMsg device and I don't understand the reasoning for 
doing this. As far as I understand namespace announcements 
belong to RPMsg devices / channels, they create a dedicated 
endpoint on them with a fixed pre-defined address. But they 
don't form a separate RPMsg device. I think the current 
virtio_rpmsg_bus.c has that correctly: for each rpmsg device / 
channel multiple endpoints can be created, where the NS 
service is one of them. It's just an endpoing of an rpmsg 
device, not a complete separate device. Have I misunderstood 
anything?

Thanks
Guennadi
