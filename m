You don't need to reflect all the layers that the system has in the
software, if some of the layers are always used together with no
possibility of replacing them then it can make sense to collapse them in
software.  That did seem to be the case here.

It's fine, just be aware that you still need to have appropriate
dependencies and selects in the user.

This isn't at all clear looking at the code, perhaps it would be clearer
with fewer layers of abstraction but at the minute it's a lot of effort
to confirm if it's safe.

That's the expected usage.

It'd be duplicated effort in all the users, if the only way to use the
bus is with this configuration then simply saying that they're using the
bus should be enough.
