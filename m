Oh, I think you're right.

The 'finish' thing isn't too far from the truth; it's the last thing we
need to do with the prev task (in terms of sched bookkeeping, I mean) -
and in Chen's defence ISTR Peter suggested that name.

Seeing as it's a "supercharged" put_prev_task(), I could live with the
marginally shorter "put_prev_task_balance()".
