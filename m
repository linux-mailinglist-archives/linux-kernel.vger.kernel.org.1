I figured out what was causing this, and that's just that the writer and
the iterator could end up almost "in sync" where the writer writes to each
of the pages the iterator is trying to read, and this can trigger the three
failures of "zero commits" per page.

I had a way to detect this, but then realized that it may be possible for
an active writer to possibly trigger the other failures to get an event,
that I just decided to force it to try three times, and simply return NULL
if an active writer is messing with the iterator. The iterator is a "best
effort" to read the buffer if there's an active writer. The consumer read
(trace_pipe) is made for that.

This patch should solve you issues.

(care to give a Tested-by: if it works for you?)

Subject: [PATCH] ring-buffer: Don't deactivate the ring buffer on failed
 iterator reads

If the function tracer is running and the trace file is read (which uses the
ring buffer iterator), the iterator can get in sync with the writes, and
caues it to fail to find a page with content it can read three times. This
causes a warning and deactivation of the ring buffer code.

Looking at the other cases of failure to get an event, it appears that
there's a chance that the writer could cause them too. Since the iterator is
a "best effort" to read the ring buffer if there's an active writer (the
consumer reader is made for this case "see trace_pipe"), if it fails to get
an event after three tries, simply give up and return NULL. Don't warn, nor
disable the ring buffer on this failure.
