You might achieve the same with DEBUG loglevel. Or do I miss anything?

IMHO, developers already have troubles to decide between the existing
8 loglevels. And it is easier because the names describe the severity.

NO_CONSOLES would be different. The effect is almost[*] clear. But only
few people would know the background why it was introduced and where
to use it.

I know that it is meant as a modifier, like LOGLEVEL_SCHED and
KERN_CONT. But this is another reason to avoid it. We already have
huge pain with these two modifiers. They both do not work well.

[*] It will have no effect when it was disabled by a sysfs knob.
