Thanks.  Though it was only the "locked"->"lruvec" changes I was
suggesting to fold back, to minimize the diff, so that we could
see your use of lruvec_holds_page_lru_lock() more clearly - you
had not introduced that function at the stage of the earlier patches.

But now that I stare at it again, using lruvec_holds_page_lru_lock()
there doesn't look like an advantage to me: when it decides no, the
same calculation is made all over again in mem_cgroup_page_lruvec(),
whereas the code before only had to calculate it once.

So, the code before looks better to me: I wonder, do you think that
rcu_read_lock() is more expensive than I think it?  There can be
debug instrumentation that makes it heavier, but by itself it is
very cheap (by design) - not worth branching around.

That would be satisfying.  Not necessary, but I agree satisfying.
Maybe depends also on your "skip" change, which I've not looked at yet?

Yes, I think that would be safe, and would look better.  But I am
very hesitant to give snap assurances here (I've twice missed out
a vital PageLRU check from this sequence myself): it is very easy
to deceive myself and only see it later.

If you can see a bug in what's there before these patches, certainly
we need to fix it.  But adding non-essential patches to the already
overlong series risks delaying it.
