So you're saying that the intention of the ->running check already in
q6v5_wdog_interrupt() was to allow either the stop-ack or wdog
interrupt to complete the stop. This patch just fixes a regression
introduced during the refactor.
This patch seems ok to me then. It still sort of seems like a bug that
the modem responds arbitrarily in one of two ways, even to a "harsh"
shutdown request.

I wasn't aware of QCOM_SYSMON. Reading it now, It seems like kind of a
lot... do I really need all this? Can I get by with just remoteproc
stops?
Anyway, for this patch:
