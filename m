It sounds closer than what I'd expect.

I'd need to take another look, but the ULP gate sounds like a bridge (or
close to it).

I understand. It looks like the right direction. Let's discuss code when
we have code to look at.

It may take a couple of iterations to get it all sorted.

That's normal when you show show up with that much code all at once :)
