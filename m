Yeah, sorry for the typo.

This is to make things more uniform. The thing is: before the
ReST conversion, there were a mess of capitalization on titles.
Some documents all caps, others just the first letter, others
camel case and there were even some documents whose titles
were all lower case. Now, almost all documents are using the
same capitalization for titles.

It is for consistency reasons. On all converted docs I touched, I used
the same convention for such markups: "Notes", "Important", "Warning"...

Thanks,
