Your commit description says "adding the iommus field for UFS is 
required
because initializing the iommu removes the bypass mapping that created 
by the
bootloader". So here it would mean like iommus property for UFS is not 
for
enabling address translation by SMMU for UFS but to avoid removing 
mappings
created by the bootloader which is not exactly what iommus property is 
for.

Ok since you are very sure about this, I will try with your patches on
SM8150 MTP tomorrow since I do not have access to one now.
Also just to make sure, please remove all the extra SMMU patches you 
have
in your tree which are not yet merged or from downstream kernel.
