  sh: remove sh5 support (2020-04-24 22:20:55 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
sh: remove sh5 support

At long last, this is the removal of the 64-bit sh5 port
that never went into production.

Signed-off-by: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

----------------------------------------------------------------

v2: I should have fixed all the missing changes that Geert pointed out,
    this time sending it as a pull request as the removal patch is
    too big for the mailing lists, and a 'git format-patch -D' patch
    is unreliable
