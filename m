The low/high part would only be relevant on a 32-bit LPAE platform which
is probably a corner case, I would just pass the shmem_paddr / 4096
since that is the smallest granule size and alignment possible and it
still allows you to map up to 36-bits of physical address, which is the
maximum that the long descriptor in LPAE can support. For 64-bit we have
no such problems since we have the full register width.

But presumably the Linux shared memory area should be mapped in a

My only concern is that if somehow Linux gets assigned a shared memory
range that is completely outside of what the trusted firmware has
already mapped, or is capable of addressing, or any combination thereof,
it could be challenging to debug what is going on, especially if INVALID
PARAMETER must not be returned (assuming this is to avoid Linux
discovering where other shared memory areas pertaining to the firmware
reside?).

The other concern I have is that we are not documenting the various
SMCCC calling conventions, soon enough it will be come out of control,
and we are already allowing people to define their own function IDs and
parameters to call into the trusted firmware. This sounds like something
that is so basic that it should be standardized from the top, by ARM.

My review is by no means authoritative however in deploying SCMI on our
Broadcom STB platforms some experience was gained in the process which
is how it piqued my interest. Thanks for providing more background to
this patch, this does help.

We have opted for a solution where the boot loader knows about all
possible reserved regions prior to booting/loading the trusted firmware
as well as the kernel, therefore it can pass that information to both
and we never really had a situation where the two need to evolve in an
uncoordinated way.
