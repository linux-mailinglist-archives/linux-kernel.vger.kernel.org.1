The config function was specifically for attribute config
not for other llcc configs like these, so I will rename
qcom_llcc_attr_cfg() to _qcom_llcc_cfg_program() and move
everything there.

As a side note, I have your mails in my inbox but these
messages are not appearing in the list [1]. For Patch 2,
its on the list [2]. I have noticed same thing on your
messages for previous patches, where your reply for one
patch was on the list but the other one was missing, you
might have to check that.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1305132/
[2] https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1305133/

Same with lore.kernel.org/lkml/ links but since url was big, I gave the
above patchwork links.

Thanks,
Sai
