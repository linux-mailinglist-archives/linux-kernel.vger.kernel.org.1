I'm sorry for the triple e-mail... but I've just acknowledged that using 
platform_get_irq is actually impossible with the current schema.
As you can see in the dt-bindings documentation, the driver is supposed 
to be declared in DT as

		labibb {

			compatible = "qcom,pmi8998-lab-ibb";



			ibb: ibb {

				interrupts = <0x3 0xdc 0x2 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,

					     <0x3 0xdc 0x0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

				interrupt-names = "sc-err", "ocp";

			};



			lab: lab {

				interrupts = <0x3 0xde 0x1 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,

					     <0x3 0xde 0x0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

				interrupt-names = "sc-err", "ocp";

			};

		};

...which was already a requirement before I touched it.
Now, this leaves two options here:
1. Keep the of_get_irq way, or
2. Move the interrupts, change the documentation (currently, only 
pmi8998.dtsi) and also fix pmi8998.dtsi to reflect the new changes.

I am asking before proceeding because I know that changing a schema that 
is already set sometimes gets "negated".

How should I proceed?
