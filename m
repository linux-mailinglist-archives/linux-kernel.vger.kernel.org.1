>   always run in GSI mode.  Since there is no support for GSI mode in

> - Some boards with sc7180 have SPI connected to the Chrome OS EC or
>   security chip (Cr50).  The protocols for talking to cros_ec and cr50
>   are extremely complex.  Both drivers in Linux fully lock the bus
>   across several distinct SPI transfers.  While I am not an expert on
>   GSI mode it feels highly unlikely to me that we'd ever be able to
>   enable GSI mode for these devices.
>=20
