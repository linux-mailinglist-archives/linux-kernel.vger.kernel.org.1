I agree. Having this standardized by ARM is probably what we really
need.

Just to clarify, your review is very welcome and much appreciated.
Indeed, feedback from engineers with previous experience like yours is
really helpful. With the link above I didn't mean to dismiss your
feedback, but only to provide some background / context.
