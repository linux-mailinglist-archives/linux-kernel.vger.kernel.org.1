Hi Kees,
Thanks for your review - I will incorporate what I can into v3, or
explain why not once I give it a try :).

This did suck to debug. Thank goodness for debugging with gdb in a VM.
As you know, I had previously had a patch to use a prand to be able to
retain the same layout across boots, and that came in handy here. While
we decided to not submit this functionality with this initial merge
attempt, I will add it on in the future as it does make debugging much
easier when you can reliably duplicate failure modes.
