We need to fix this for real, as you stated at best this reduces the
window that the race can happen.

I think our main problem is that due to bd_mutex we can't update the
block device size from arbitrary context.  If we instead add an irqsave
spinlock just for the size we'd get rid of the limitation and can stop
papering over the problem.  Give m a little time to try to do that.
