Dear Friend,

My name is Mr. Michael Williams, I am a newly promoted Branch Manager of 
a Bank here in Ghana, West Africa, I got your information during my 
Search through the Internet.

It may interest you to hear that I am a man of PEACE and don't want 
problems, I only hope we can assist each other. If you don't want this 
business offer kindly forget it, as I will not contact you again.

I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of us, as 
the Branch Manager of the Bank, it is my duty to send in a Financial 
Report to my head office in the capital city Accra at the end of each 
year.

In the course of the last year 2019 end of the year report, I discovered 
that my branch in which I am the Manager made an excess profit of 
[US$12.5 Million dollars] which my head office are not aware of and will 
never be aware of. I have since placed this fund in a SUNDRY ACCOUNT.

As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly linked to this money, so 
this informed my contacting you for us to work together so that you can 
assist me and receive this fund into your bank account in your country 
for us to SHARE.

I am offering you 40% of the total fund, while you keep 60% for me in 
your bank account till I join you in your country for the 
sharing/investment of my own share of the funds or better still we can 
go into a joint partnership venture, I will appreciate it very much.

As soon as I receive your response I will give you more details on how 
we can achieve it successfully.

Sincerely,
Mr. Michael Williams
