UEFI plus the in-kernel UEFI stub is, in some ways, a "bootloader" in
the traditional sense. It is totally fair that we should update the
documentation with this as a different case, though, because it is part
of the kernel tree and so the kernel now has partial ownership of the
namespace.

I suggest "STUB" for "in-kernel firmware stub" for this purpose; no need
to restrict it to a specific firmware for the purpose of namespace
reservation.
