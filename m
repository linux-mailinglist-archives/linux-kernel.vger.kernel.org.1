Basically any device without VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM
(that is it's name in latest virtio spec, VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM is
what linux calls it) is declared as "special, don't follow normal rules
for access".

So yes swiotlb_xen is not a property of virtio, but what *is* a property
of virtio is that it's not special, just a regular device from DMA POV.

That device would be basically broken, since hardware
can't know whether it can access all memory or not.

IOMMU is a misnomer here.  Virtio spec now calls this bit
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM. We should have done the same a while ago -
I'll send a patch.

Why is it a problem? It just makes virtio use DMA API.
If that in turn works, problem solved.
