When clearing memory because "it may be sensitive" rather than "it's needed for
the code to behave correctly", I think it's best to use memzero_explicit() to
make the intent clear, even if it seems that memset() is sufficient.  Also keep
in mind that support for compiling the kernel with LTO (link-time optimization)
is being worked on (and some people already do it), which results in more code
being optimized out.
