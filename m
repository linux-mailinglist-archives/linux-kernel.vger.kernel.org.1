The way to handle the remapping of the first 2MB is incorrect: Atish has 
issues while using an initrd because the initrd_start variable is 
defined using __va between setup_vm and setup_vm_final and then its 
value is inconsistent after setup_vm_final since virtual addressing was 
modified with the remapping of the first 2MB.

I will come with another solution to this problem since the way I handle 
it for now is not correct.

Thanks,

Alex
