Which is probably a very good thing, as long as all your devices 
generate
only edge-triggered interrupts.

At the GIC level, once the interrupt is Ack'd, anything that is signed
after this ack is a separate interrupt. It will be made pending and will
fire once the GIC driver EOIs the first one.

Why do you need to do anything at the doorbell level? This is just a 
write,
so there should be nothing to clear. If you do need to clear anything,
then your MSI-IRQ bridge isn't stateless as it should, and you'll need 
to
give much more details about the HW. Do you have a pointer to the TRM
for your HW?

Well, setting all of this in firmware is always the preferred option
if you don't expect things to change dynamically.

unmask is just a static configuration to enable the interrupt. There 
shouldn't
be that many calls to that later on unless an endpoint driver 
disables/enables
interrupts by hand.

Please give us a bit more details to understand the context, as there is 
only
so much I can do with so little HW information.

Thanks,

         M.
