I think we discussed this before (and originally that was the plan), but I
believe one of the goals for bringing recordmcount into objtool is to speed
up the processing. Instead of having to read the elf sections for each use
case, we do it once, and then execute all the necessary operations for that
build.

If we just have a elf parsing library, then each object file is going to
have that read redundantly for each operation that is done on it.

I was hoping to have objtool handle all the operations needed that required
reading elf headers.

But if that's not what objtool maintainers want, then we can certainly go
back to looking at pulling out the elf headers, and have each tool be a
standalone again.
