So technically yes, we can be bothered by this on arm32 - Sudeep pointed
out a list of DT files that shows platforms with non-zero values in Aff1 or
above.

However, the bigger issue is that artificial separation in clusters of 16
CPUs due to extra limitations on Aff0 (mainly due to GICv3 AIUI). Given
that GICv2 can support at most 8 CPU interfaces, I don't think we have it
as bad on arm32.
