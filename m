Ugh, nasty. Same here with gcc 10.

I was hoping a WRITE_ONCE(current->capture_control) would be enough,
but apparently it's not (I tried).

But perhaps I would also make sure that we don't expose the half initialized
capture_control and run into this problem again later. It's not like this is a
fast path where barriers hurt. Something like this then? (with added comments)
