got it, we will double check again, that we go through the data
and it can be reproduced in our environment before sending out report.

Hi Linus, it is currently embedded in different scripts, like tests/stress-ng,
but it now depends on up level script like lkp run to call them to pass the
parameters from job.yaml. It can provide some basic information. Meanwhile
we try to generate a reproduce script for test running, I add more info
in below reply, kindly check.

Thanks Linus for your feedback, we will improve this to provide
more clear reproduce information.

In the attachment, there's a reproduce script with content like below,
which is another way to directly run the stress-ng. This helps to show
which parameters we are using when having this report. Would you mind to
have a look?

for cpu_dir in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*
do
	online_file="$cpu_dir"/online
	[ -f "$online_file" ] && [ "$(cat "$online_file")" -eq 0 ] && continue

	file="$cpu_dir"/cpufreq/scaling_governor
	[ -f "$file" ] && echo "performance" > "$file"
done

 "stress-ng" "--timeout" "30" "--times" "--verify" "--metrics-brief" "--sequential" "96" "--class" "pipe" "--exclude" "spawn,exec,swap"

Thanks
