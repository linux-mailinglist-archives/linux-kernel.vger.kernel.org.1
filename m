I've seen pretty much the same thing - I was helping paulmck test
rcu-dev for something hopefully unrelated, when I 1st saw it, and
assumed it came in with the sched-core merge and was using one under
that as "good" to attempt bisect.

> producing bogus results from over-eager 'good', but the last two runs

Yeah - it sucks.  I was using Paul's TREE03 rcu-torture for loading and
even after a two hour test I'd still get "false good" results.  Only
after 7h was I quite confident that good was really good.

I was down to 10 commits roughly above and below this guy before hearing
you were working the same problem.

I just got this guy to reveal a false load after a 2h test as well.
I want to let the one underneath soak overnight just to also confirm it
is "good" - so that is pending.

What I can add, is that it is like we are "leaking" an instance into
calc_load_tasks -- which isn't anything new -- see when tglx fixed it
before in d60585c5766.  Unfortunate we don't have some low overhead leak
checks on that... ?

Anyway, if I "fix" the leak, then everything seems back to normal:

   (gdb) p calc_load_tasks
   $2 = {counter = 1}
   (gdb) set variable calc_load_tasks = { 0 }
   (gdb) p calc_load_tasks
   $4 = {counter = 0}
   (gdb) continue
   Continuing.

Obviously that isn't a fix, but it shows it is an accounting thing.
I've also used gdb to snoop all the cfs->avg fields and they look as
expected for a completely idle machine.  Nothing hiding in avg_rt or
avg_dl either.

I've not tried the revert (yet) - but Kyle saw me boring people on
#kernel with the details of bisecting this and gave me the heads-up you
were looking at it too (thanks Kyle!).   So I figured I'd better add
what I'd seen so far.

I'm testing with what is largely a defconfig, plus KVM_INTEL (needed for
paulmck TREE03 rcu-torture), plus I enabled KGDB and DEBUG_INFO after a
while so I could poke and prod - but was reproducing it before that.

For completeness, the test was:

  tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/bin/kvm.sh --cpus 24 --duration 120 \
	--configs TREE03 --trust-make

...on a 24 core 2013 vintage xeon-v2 COTS box.   As above, the 120m
seemed to give between 60-75% confidence on not getting a false good.

Anyway - so that is all I know so far...

Paul.
