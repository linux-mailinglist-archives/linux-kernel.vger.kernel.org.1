Quoting from there:

Userspace should always zero everything.  I don't think that the padding
between fields is any different from the other bytes padding the header
to 128 bytes.

Yes, that was what I was hinting at with "it might as well send it now"
(i.e., after the patch).

(All of this is moot for userspace that just uses KVM_GET_NESTED_STATE
and passes it back to KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE).

The alternative, which is almost as good, is to only use these extra
fields which could be garbage if the flags are not set, and check the
flags (see the patches I have sent earlier today).

The chance of the flags passing the check will decrease over time as
more flags are added; but the chance of having buggy userspace that
sends down garbage also will.

There are 8 bytes before the union, and it's not a coincidence. :)
"Header" refers to the stuff before the data region.
