As discussed over in
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20200604164814.GA7600@kernel.org/,
Mike's "mm: remove __ARCH_HAS_5LEVEL_HACK" patchset
(http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200414153455.21744-1-rppt@kernel.org) is
expected to fix this.  5level-fixup.h gets removed.

I hope to have that patchset sent over later today.
