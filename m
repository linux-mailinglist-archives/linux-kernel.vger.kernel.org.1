As an aside, where is TAP14?

I think making the plan mandatory is a good idea.  "Late plans" work
very well for cases where you cannot know in advance the number of tests
(for example in filters that produce TAP from other output), and provide
an additional safety net.

+1.

I think no mandatory dash is better (or even mandatory no-dash!).  We
can suggest removing it when formatting TAP output.

How so?  The description comes first, but there can be a description of
the directive.

     not ok 4 - Summarized correctly # TODO Not written yet

True.  However, "Bail out!" allow to distinguish issues with the harness
(such as ENOSPC) from test aborts.

XFAIL/XPASS are different from SKIP.  I personally don't have a need for
them, but kselftests includes XFAIL/XPASS exit codes and they aren't
reflected into selftests/kselftest/runner.sh.

Likewise, kselftest.h has ksft_inc_xfail_cnt but not
ksft_test_result_xfail/ksft_test_result_xpass.

It's important to notice in the spec that the TODO directive inverts the
direction of ok/not-ok (i.e. XFAIL, the "good" result, is represented by
"not ok # TODO").

What about "/" instead?

See above for XFAIL.

I initially raised the issue with "SKIP" because I have a lot of tests
that depend on hardware availability---for example, a test that does not
run on some processor kinds (e.g. on AMD, or old Intel)---and for those
SKIP should be considered a success.
