Sorry, in the eagerness to address all your concerns, I had forgotten
to update the commit text in v2. I'll reword it to clarify this'll
happen only when there's no timeout set.

Those consumers that haven't probed can be powered on and active and
can crash the system if the power is pulled under their feet.

Is this different from what's done already? Not having this delay is
easy -- but will have to be at a global level across
devices/resources.

Again, sorry I didn't update the commit text. I'll skip replying to
rest of your comments on the commit text, because all of them are due
to stale commit text.

I agree. I renamed it to try and make it better, but I can see how
it's more confusing once you called it out. Suggestions?

regulator_set_boot_limits? regulator_set_boot_constraints?

We want to wait till supply is set up before we try to put the
"enable" vote on a regulator. Otherwise, it won't be propagated
properly? I do know that regulator_resolve_supply() takes care of
propagating the use count, but we could delete that code if we just
till the supply is resolved before "enabling" the regulator. The usual
clients can't "get" the regulator anyway without the supply being
resolved. Long story short, doing it this way can allow us to delete
some functionally duplicative code.

Your understanding is correct. I'll try to clarify the commit text as
best as I can. Your concerns are why this is not the default behavior.
For Android phones that are actually shipped, ensuring every enabled
consumer actually probes is trivial and desired.

Agree about the naming. Maybe boot_limits?

Agreed. I'll add a log similar to the existing clean up path.

I think the last line is a typo?

Anyway, I just have the dev_set_drv_sync_state() call here instead of
spending time on a patch that sets .sync_state() for 100s of regulator
drivers before we can actually agree on the bigger picture/idea. Once
the patch becomes acceptable, I'd like to go set this for every
regulator driver and delete the call to dev_set_drv_sync_state().

As to why this is configurable per driver, we discussed this in the v1
thread. sync_state() isn't specific to the regulator framework (which
I'm sure you understand) -- so it needs to be flexible.
Devices/drivers like MFDs, PMICs with GPIOs, power domains with reset
control, etc might want to call into multiple frameworks when they get
their sync state. Some devices/drivers might want to do more stuff
specific to their device/system when they get the sync state callback
-- they can spin their own sync_state() callback, do their stuff and
then call regulator_sync_state() or whatever other framework they
want. That's why it's configurable per device/driver.

Sorry, this is a dumb mistake. I forgot to replace the 30000ms that's
a few lines below with regulator_cleanup_timeout.

I'm also reaching out to vendors/partners to try and gather some
examples. There are plenty of real world examples but the ones I know
are mostly in downstream kernels that are shipped in Android phones.
So trying to find ones in upstream or get vendors to speak up about
how often this is an issue downstream. This is also kind of a catch
22. Vendors hack up their regulator driver and the regulator framework
to get this "boot on" regulator handling working, but they can't
obviously upstream their drivers because the hacks aren't acceptable.
I don't want to debate that can of worms right now -- I'm trying to
find upstream examples first (which I hope isn't hard).

I'll send out v3 addressing your comments once I get a better handle
on the examples. Thanks for the reviews and being open to finding a
solution that works for everyone.
