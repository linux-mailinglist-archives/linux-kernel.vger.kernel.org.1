I'm finding this changelog quite hard to understand,

I think this is saying that in the absence of KEXEC_SIG_FORCE and if
the signature/crypto/key are all incorrect, the kexec still succeeds,
but it should not.

I don't know if this is describing the current situation or the
post-patch situation.

I think the whole thing needs a rewrite.  Start out by fully describing
the current situation.  THen describe what is wrong with it, and why. 
Then describe the proposed change.  Or something along these lines.

The changelog should also make clear the end-user impact of the patch. 
In sufficient detail for others to decide which kernel version(s)
should be patched.  Your recommendations will also be valuable - which
kernel version(s) do you think should be patched, and why?
