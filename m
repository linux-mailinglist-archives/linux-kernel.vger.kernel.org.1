In the /proc/pid/maps case the code for reading an address like
"00400000-00452000 " the code is:

if (io__get_hex(io, start) != '-')
  return false;
if (io__get_hex(io, end) != ' ')
  return false;

If io__get_hex doesn't return the next character it becomes:

if (io__get_hex(io, start))
  return false;
if (io__get_char(io) != '-')
  return false;
if (io__get_hex(io, end))
  return false;
if (io__get_char(io) != ' ')
  return false;

Which is twice as verbose and requires that io have a rewind operation
to go backward when io__get_hex and io__get_dec have gone 1 character
too far.

Thanks, feedback appreciated! It is useful to discuss and it is
straightforward to change the API but I'm in two minds as to whether
it would be better.

I'd still like to land this and the next patch, as getting rid of
fgets/sscanf saves 50us from event synthesis. Breaking out the io part
of that change wasn't done so much with a view to replacing stdio, but
just something minimal that serves the /proc/pid/maps case.

Thanks,
Ian
