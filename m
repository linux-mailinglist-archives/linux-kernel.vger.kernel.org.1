Ah, true.  "core" sounds good.

OK, sounds about what I expected.  I suppose the path of least
resistance would be to just drop clock-names.  I guess I'm just
worried that down the road someone will want to specify the "iface"
clock too.  If that ever happens, we're stuck with these options:

1. Be the first ones to require adding clk_get_by_index().

2. Use the frowned upon of_clk_get() API which allows getting by index.

3. Get the first clock with clk_get(NULL) and the second clock with
clk_get("iface") and figure out how to specify this happily in the
yaml.

If we just define clock-names now then we pretty much match the
pattern of everyone else.


Srinivas: reading all that if you still want me to drop clock-names
then I will.  I'll use clk_get(NULL) to get the clock and if/when we
ever need an "iface" clock (maybe we never will?) we can figure it out
then.
