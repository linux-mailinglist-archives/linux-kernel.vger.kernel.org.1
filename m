We rely on it, indeed. If the pcp-cache is depleted our special work is
triggered to charge our local cache(few pages) such way will also initiate
the process of pre-featching pages from the buddy allocator populating
the depleted pcp-cache. I do not have any concern here.

I see your point Michal. As i mentioned before, it is important to avoid of
having such own pools, because the aim is not to waste memory resources. A
page will be returned back to "page allocator" as soon as a scheduler place  
our reclaim thread on a CPU and grace period is passed. So, the resource
can be used for other needs. What is important.

Otherwise a memory footprint is increased what is bad for low memory
conditions when OOM is involved. Just in case, it is a big issue for
mobile devices.

It might be an issue for embedded devices when such devices run into a
low memory condition resulting in OOM or slow allocations due to mentioned
condition. For servers and big system it will not be visible.

I mentioned above. We can not rely on static model. We would like to
have a mechanism that gives back ASAP used pages to page allocator
for other needs.

I see your concern. pcplist can be monopolized by already existing API:

    while (i < 100)
        __get_free_page(GFP_NOWAIT | __GFP_NOWARN);

Hmm.. I think it is. Sorry if i missed that but i hope i mentioned about it.

Could you please elaborate? Do not want to speculate :)

OK.

Thank you for your comments, Michal!
