Looks nice!

Toggling a static branch is AFAIK quite disruptive (PeterZ will probably tell
you better), and with the default 100ms sample interval, I'd think it's not good
to toggle it so often? Did you measure what performance would you get, if the
static key was only for long-term toggling the whole feature on and off (boot
time or even runtime), but the decisions "am I in a sample interval right now?"
would be normal tests behind this static key? Thanks.
