Ext4 will fix file system fuzzing attack bugs on a best efforts basis.
That is, when I have time, I've been known to stay up late to bugs
reported by fuzzers.  I hope ext4 is safe, but I'm not going to make
any guarantees that it is Bug-Free(tm).  If you want to trust it in
that way, you do so at your risk.

As far as VFS is concerned, I'm not aware of anyone who has been
working on fuzz-proofing VFAT, and looking at the Vault 2016 for
"American Fuzzy Lop"[1] while VFAT wasn't specifically tested, for the
vast majority of file systems, the "time to first bug" typically
ranged from seconds to minutes, with the exception of XFS and ext4
(where it was roughly 2 hours).  The specific bugs which triggered in
the 2016 AFL presentation have been fixed, at least for the file
systems which get regular maintainer attention, but this is why I try
to caution people not to count on file systems being proof against
maliciously formatted images.

Using USB sticks is fine, so long as you trust the provenance of the
drive.  If you take a random USB stick that is handed to you by
someone whom you don't trust implicitly, or worse, that you picked up
abandoned on the sidewalk, there have been plenty of articles which
describe why this is a REALLY BAD IDEA, and even if you ignore
OS-level vuleranbilities, there are also firwmare and hardware based
vulerabilities that would put your computer at risk.  See [2] and [3]
for more details; there's a reason why I've visited at least one
financial institution where they put epoxy in USB ports to prevent
clueless workers from potentially compromising the bank's computers.

As far as documentation is concerned, how far should we go?  Should
there be a warning in the execve(2) system call man page that you
shouldn't download random binaries from the network and execute them?  :-)
