Ah; those are precisely the cases I'm currently fixing, so if we're
lucky this is an indirect result of one of those rather than a novel
source of pain...

That is a very good idea. I'd been relying on Syzkaller to tickle the
issue, but the torture infrastructure is a much better fit for this
problem. I hadn't realise how comprehensive the scripting was, thanks
for this!

I'll see about giving that a go once I have the irq-from-idle cases
sorted, as those are very obviously broken if you hack
trace_hardirqs_{on,off}() to check that RCU is watching.

Thanks,
Mark.
