Yeah this seems imho the only legit use-case for a something like the
sysfs entry for the fpga-region. That being said once we add that, it's
going to become ABI and everyone is gonna use that instead of
implementing a proper driver using FPGA Regions to deal with
re-enumeration.

We don't really have a good way of modelling systems where the bus is
100% discoverable (like a PCI device), but only after we load firmware.

I mean you could implement a FPGA manager for your CPLD that also
instantiates a region that you then target when you want to reprogram
the FPGA region. How you'd tie that together though with the PCI device
to get the bus to be re-enumerated as part of reprogramming the region,
I'm not 100% sure :)

Sorry for the late response, things are busy at the moment.
