So if this was a change to a structure in some performance sensitive
path, I'd totally understand how it could end up with a 14% change on
some benchmark that stressed that code path.

But I doubt the kernel ever touches a "struct mce" during execution
of your benchmark (I presume your test machine isn't getting thousands
of corrected memory errors during the test :-) ).

We do have some DEFINE_PER_CPU data objects of type "struct mce":

$ git grep 'DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct mce,'
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mce/core.c:static DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct mce, mces_seen);
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mce/core.c:DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct mce, injectm);

Maybe making those slightly bigger has pushed some other per_cpu object
into an unfortunate alignment where some frequently used data is now
split between two cache lines instead of sitting in one?

Can you collect some perf trace data for the benchmark when running
on kernels with kflags as __u32 and __u64 (looks to be the minimal
possible change that you found that still exhibits this problem).

We'd like to find out which kernel functions are burning extra CPU
cycles and maybe understand why.

The answer isn't to tinker with "struct mce". Other changes could trigger
this same change in alignment. Anything that is this perfomance sensitive
needs to have some "__attribute__((aligned(64)))" (or whatever) to
make sure arbitrary changes elsewhere don't do this.
