Pre-allocating has some drawbacks:

a) It is impossible to predict how many pages will be required to
   cover a demand that is controlled by different workloads on
   various systems.

b) Memory overhead since we do not know how much pages should be
   preloaded: 100, 200 or 300

As for memory overhead, it is important to reduce it because of
embedded devices like phones, where a low memory condition is a
big issue. In that sense pre-allocating is something that we strongly
would like to avoid.

I think here is a small misunderstanding. Please note, that is not only
about performance and corner cases. There is a single argument support
of the kvfree_rcu(ptr), where maintaining an array in time is needed.
The fallback of the single argument case is extrimely slow.

Single-argument details is here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/4/28/1626

If depleted, we have a special worker that charge it. From the other hand,
the pcplist can be depleted by its nature, what _is_ not wrong. But just
in case we secure it since you had a concern about it.

Could you please specify a real test case or workload you are talking about?

Thank you for your comments and help.
