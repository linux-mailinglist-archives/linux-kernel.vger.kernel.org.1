Yup as-is (especially with the goal of this being aimed at ml/compute
only) drivers/hyperv sounds a bunch more reasonable than drivers/gpu.

I've recently added regex matches to MAINTAINERS so we'll see
dma_buf/fence/anything show up on dri-devel. So that part is solved
hopefully.

Yeah once we have the feature-creep to presentation support all the
integration fun starts, with all the questions about "why does this
not look like any other linux gpu driver". We have that already with
nvidia insisting they just can't implement any of the upstream gpu
uapi we have, but at least they're not in-tree, so not our problem
from an upstream maintainership pov.

But once this dx12 pipe is landed and then we want to extend it it's
still going to have all the "we can't ever release the sources to any
of the parts we usually expect to be open for gpu drivers in upstream"
problems. Then we're stuck at a rather awkward point of why one vendor
gets an exception and all the others dont.

Well there is some in the form of "more hw/platform support". But
given that gpus evolved rather fast, including the entire integration
ecosystem (it's by far not just the hw drivers that move quickly). So
that value deprecates a lot faster than for other kernel subsystems.
And all that's left is the pain of not breaking anything without
actually being able to evolve the overall stack in any meaningful way.
