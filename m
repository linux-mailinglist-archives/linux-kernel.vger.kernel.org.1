Agreed, it's the one bit that may be regarded as a regression, but what is
already out there is quite broken :(

So those have 0x53 for Aff2 for all cores, which is going to end up in the
package_id. AFAICT that means that

  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/topology/physical_package_id

is going to look pretty wild.
