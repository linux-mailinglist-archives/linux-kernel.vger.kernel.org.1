Yes. I wanted to (ab)use this patch to clarify this. x86 and arm64 use
CPU instructions (so far), S390 copies from some buffer. PPC uses either
a CPU instruction or an MMIO access. All of these I would consider
comparably cheap, especially when compared to a firmware call with
unknown costs. In fact the current Trusted Firmware implementation[1] is
not really terse, also the generic SMC dispatcher calls a platform
defined routine, which could do anything.
So to also guide the implementation in TF-A, it would be good to
establish what arch_get_random expects to be. The current
implementations and the fact that it lives in a header file suggests
that it's meant as a slim wrapper around something cheap.

Yes, agreed.
So I have a hwrng driver for the Arm SMCCC TRNG interface ready. I would
post this, but would like to know if we should drop the proposed
arch_get_random implementation [2][3] of this interface.

That's true, it seems we chickened out on the arm64 implementation
already, by not using the intended stronger instruction for seed
(RNDRRS), and not implementing arch_get_random_long() at all.
But I guess that's another story.

Cheers,
Andre.
