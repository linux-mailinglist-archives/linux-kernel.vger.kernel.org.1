To enable/disable kernel access to user space, the 8xx has to
modify the properties of access group 1. This is done by writing
predefined values into SPRN_Mx_AP registers.

As of today, a __put_user() gives:

00000d64 <my_test>:
 d64:	3d 20 4f ff 	lis     r9,20479
 d68:	61 29 ff ff 	ori     r9,r9,65535
 d6c:	7d 3a c3 a6 	mtspr   794,r9
 d70:	39 20 00 00 	li      r9,0
 d74:	90 83 00 00 	stw     r4,0(r3)
 d78:	3d 20 6f ff 	lis     r9,28671
 d7c:	61 29 ff ff 	ori     r9,r9,65535
 d80:	7d 3a c3 a6 	mtspr   794,r9
 d84:	4e 80 00 20 	blr

Because only groups 0 and 1 are used, the definition of
groups 2 to 15 doesn't matter.
By setting unused bits to 0 instead on 1, one instruction is
removed for each lock and unlock action:

00000d5c <my_test>:
 d5c:	3d 20 40 00 	lis     r9,16384
 d60:	7d 3a c3 a6 	mtspr   794,r9
 d64:	39 20 00 00 	li      r9,0
 d68:	90 83 00 00 	stw     r4,0(r3)
 d6c:	3d 20 60 00 	lis     r9,24576
 d70:	7d 3a c3 a6 	mtspr   794,r9
 d74:	4e 80 00 20 	blr
