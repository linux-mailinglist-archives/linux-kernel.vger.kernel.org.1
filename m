As I said "it means nothing if you've never interacted with gambling
culture," red black in the context of the trees as zero meaning other
than as a name to find it on the internet, Search for that name enough
and you will undoubtedly be getting ads for online roulette sites
within hours, if you have a problem gambling past, this might not be
the desired effect you'd want.

The reasons something was named a particular thing can and will be
different from what a societal context for them means now, and I
believe it's more important to worry about current societal contexts
than legacy historical namings. I'm not seriously suggesting we rename
red-black trees, but if someone who had a problematic gambling
background had issues with them I'd definitely be open for considering
it.

Dave.
