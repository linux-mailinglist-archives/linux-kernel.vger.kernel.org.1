Hi Vinod,

Thanks for the input.  I do run the checkpatch script before sending
patches, and addressing the errors.  However, seems this was tagged as a
warning instead.  Will keep in mind to address as many warnings as I can
as well.

More for debug purposes in case the RPM state becomes out of sync with
the expected PHY state.  We've seen some situations during PM
suspend/resume testing where our RPM routines aren't executed, as PM
will disable RPM briefly.  It would be nice to be able to catch these
situations after collecting our crash dumps.

Agreed.

Not sure we want to put this in the phy_init() callback, as we can't
guarantee how the driver registering the PHY will use it. It'll put the
requirement of having to call phy_exit() for every phy_init() sequence,
in order to avoid unbalanced disable_depth warnings from the RPM driver.
