Hi Richard

Thank you for your patch.
This is v3 patch, but I think this is the first time for me
to receive patch...

I understand that you need sysclk/pll and .set_bias_level_xxx().
But I guess makes it generic code is difficult (?).
Thus, as Sameer doing on Tegra, creating custom audio-graph-card is better
idea for you ?

# Now I'm creating new audio-graph-card2 which also supports
# overwriting/customizing each/all functions.
# It is not full compatible with audio-graph-card, but almost same if you
# uses normal connection.
# I hope I can post it next year

Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
