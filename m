Not much better, no.  split_huge_page() can easily be called for a page
which is not on the lru list at the time, and I don't know what was the
bug which was never triggered.  Stick with whatever text you end up with
for the combination of 05/32 and 18/32, and I'll rewrite it after.

I'm not sure if you're joking there. Perhaps just a misunderstanding.

Yes, patch 06/32 does not touch the xa_lock(&mapping->i_pages) and
xa_lock(&swap_cache->i_pages) lines (odd how we've arrived at two of
those, but please do not get into cleaning it up now); but it removes
the spin_lock_irqsave(&pgdata->lru_lock, flags) which used to come
before them, and inserts a spin_lock(&pgdat->lru_lock) after them.

You call that narrowing the lru locking, okay, but I see it as also
pushing the page cache locking outwards: before this patch, page cache
lock was taken inside lru_lock; after this patch, page cache lock is
taken outside lru_lock.  If you cannot see that, then I think you
should not have touched this code at all; but it's what we have
been testing, and I think we should go forward with it.

So, you don't know why you did it either: then it will be hard to
justify.  I guess I'll have to write something for it later.  I'm
strongly tempted just to drop the patch, but expect it will become
useful later, for using lock_page_memcg() before getting lru_lock.

Okay, but the patch was written by you, and sent by you to Andrew:
that is not a case for "Signed-off-by: Someone Else".

Good to know, should have been mentioned.  s/fairness/Repeated/

But what was the gain or loss on your multiple memcg readtwice
testing without this patch, compared against node-only lru_lock?
The 80% gain mentioned before, I presume.  So this further
optimization can wait until the rest is solid.

I don't know how important the stack depth consideration is nowadays:
I still care, maybe others don't, since VMAP_STACK became an option.

Yes, please fix the reversal (if I was right on that); and I expect
you could use a singly linked list instead of the double.

But I'll look for an alternative - later, once the urgent stuff
is completed - and leave the acks on this patch to others.
