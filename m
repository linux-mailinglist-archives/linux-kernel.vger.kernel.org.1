Dear Friend,

I am Mr Rizwan  Aayan, I work at a bank here in Burkina Faso as the
manager in the audit department. During our last banking audits, I
discovered an abandoned account belong to one of our deceased customer
late Mr. Samak Thienthong from Thailand.

Meanwhile, before I contacted you, I have done personal investigation
in locating any of his relatives who know about the deceased but all
came out unsuccessful. Now I need your help as a foreigner to claim
the abandoned fund sum of $15 million U.S dollars. This money belonged
to Mr. Samak Thienthong from Thailand who died 26 December 2004 in
Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami while on vacation with his family.

After I found your information from a business contact when I was
searching for a honest partner I decided to contact you to act as his
relative so that you will claim the fund as his next of Kin. However,
i will give you full details on how the fund transfer will be executed
and also note that you will have 40% of the above mentioned while 60%
for me, if you are interested to handle this business kindly fill out
below information and send it back to me for more details.

Your full name,
Your country.
Your age.
Your occupation.
Your Phone number.
Your address.
Your sexual.
A copy of your passport or ID card.

 I am expecting to read from you soon.

 Best Regards
Mr Rizwan  Aayan     ,
