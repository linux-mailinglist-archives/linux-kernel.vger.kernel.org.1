OK, that concall's issue had nothing to do with needing higher
resolution time (was about IOPs realized with requested-based vs
bio-based).

Reality is, DM won't need anything higher resolution than jiffies until
block core's interfaces require something other than jiffies
(e.g. generic_end_io_acct).

So feel free to proceed with the conditional time fetch solution you
were going to run with (prior to my previous mail asking you to hold
off).

Sorry for the noise.  Thanks,
Mike
