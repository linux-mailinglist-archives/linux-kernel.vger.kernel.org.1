I just started looking at this for an application.

My plan is to load my FPGAs already in u-boot, but I want them 
upgradeable when running linux as well.

Since I am lazy of nature, I implemented an MTD driver for the FPGA in 
U-boot.

This means that when I do "mtd list", I get

List of MTD devices:

* nand0
   - type: NAND flash
   - block size: 0x40000 bytes
   - min I/O: 0x1000 bytes
   - OOB size: 256 bytes
   - OOB available: 6 bytes
   - ECC strength: 8 bits
   - ECC step size: 512 bytes
   - bitflip threshold: 6 bits
   - 0x000000000000-0x000020000000 : "nand0"
* spif
   - device: sspi-fpga-cfg@2
   - parent: soft-mcspi
   - driver: cyc10
   - type: FPGA
   - block size: 0x10000 bytes
   - min I/O: 0x59d8b bytes
   - 0x000000000000-0x000000059d8b : "spif"
* spyf
   - device: sspy-fpga-cfg@3
   - parent: soft-mcspi
   - driver: cyc10
   - type: FPGA
   - block size: 0x10000 bytes
   - min I/O: 0xaf6e9 bytes
   - 0x000000000000-0x0000000af6e9 : "spyf"
=>


I have a device tree:

&soft_mcspi {
	compatible = "mcspi-gpio";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&soft_mcspi1_pins>;
	status = "okay";
	gpio-sck  = <&gpio0 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	gpio-miso = <&gpio1 8 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	gpio-mosi = <&gpio1 9 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	cs-gpios =
	   <&gpio0 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,	
	   <&gpio0 13 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,	
	   <&gpio0 17 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,	
	   <&gpio0 16 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;	
	num-chipselects = <4>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	....
	sspi-fpga-cfg@2 {	/* Intel Cyclone 10, 10CL010 */
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "intel,cyclone10";
		reg = <2>; /* Chip select 0 */
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
		fpga = "spif";
		config-size	= <368011>;
		gpio-nconfig	= <&gpio3 15 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;	
		gpio-nstatus	= <&gpio3 19 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;	
		gpio-conf_done	= <&gpio3 18 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;	
		gpio-crc_error	= <&gpio2  1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;	
	};
	sspy-fpga-cfg@3 {	/* Intel Cyclone 10, 10CL025 */
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "intel,cyclone10";
		reg = <3>; /* Chip select 0 */
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
		fpga = "spyf";
		config-size	= <718569>;
		gpio-nconfig	= <&gpio3 21 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		gpio-nstatus	= <&gpio3 17 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		gpio-conf_done	= <&gpio0 18 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		gpio-crc_error	= <&gpio2 18 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	};
};

programming the FPGA in u-boot is done by the mtd command

mmc rescan
fatload mmc 0:1 spif.rbf 0x82000000
mtd write.raw spif 0x82000000

So no new commands needed. No specific FPGA support.
Just a Cyclone MTD driver.

============================

The device tree adds config-size, and a way to name it,
as well as the crc error signal (which I am yet to use)

============================

If the linux FPGA driver would be implemented as an MTD
driver, then it would be quite easy to program the FPGA

$ cat spif_configuration.rbf > /dev/spif
$ cat spyf_configuration.rbf > /dev/spyf

the mtd device would  not support erase and reads will always return all 
zeros, so it is a write-only mtd device, LOL!

============================

The way we implemented our H/W (Cyclone 10LP), the FPGA chip selects are 
just ordinary GPIO in the processor, so the are not tied to ground.

All FPGAs can be programmed separately.

Intel applications notes thinks that multiple FPGAs should connected in 
a chip select daisy chain, and then you need to do

$ cat fpga0.rbf fpga1.rbf > /dev/fpga

The config-size needs to be set to the total sum of the configuration files.

The CPU should do a single SPI transfer, and set the LSB bit in the 
flags (which the SPI driver needs to support). The current Alter/Intel
driver will manually bit-reverse each word to MSB first, which is no good.

============================

Do you guys think that implementing FPGA programming as MTD devices 
makes sense?
