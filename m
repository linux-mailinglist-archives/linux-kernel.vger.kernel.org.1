I agree with you that spec does not clearly define if VMX is required or
not. In theory you can use TXT without VMX, however this is highly
impractical because in that configuration it is impossible to use STM to
protect MLE from SMI handler as STM feature requires VMX.

All real-life MLE implementations should use STM to be compliant with
TXT idea that MLE does not have a security dependency on the pre-
existing software environment. You can find more information about STM
here: 

https://software.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/stm-user-guide-001-819978.pdf

Anyway, I have asked TXT spec owner to clarify VMX situation in next
document revision.

Yes, this is remnant from old document versions, thank you for finding
that issue. Here are changes that will go to next revision:

 * register 0x100 (TXT.VER.FSBIF) does not exist for many years and will
   be removed from TXT spec
 * register 0x200 is called TXT.VER.EMIF and indicates if chipset is
   debug of production fused

Thanks,
Lukasz
