Does this PMU use the ITS? That's a pretty odd setup.

So this is a case where the device has an implicit affinity that
isn't that of the ITS. Huhu...

It looks like part of the problem is that we can't reliably describe
an ITS affine to multiple NUMA nodes... If we could describe that, then
the above situation wouldn't occur (we'd say that ITS-0 covers both
nodes 0 and 1). But I can't find a way to express this with SRAT and
_PXM. Also, SRAT describes the affinity of the ITS with memory, and not
with the CPUs... It is all a bit fsck'd. :-(

I guess I'll apply your change for now with a comment explaining the
situation.
