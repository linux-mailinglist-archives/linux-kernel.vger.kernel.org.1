I think you need two CPUs, at least for the race I'm thinking of.
Maybe this is clearer?

CPU1:
=> spi_geni_set_cs() starts
=> spi_geni_set_cs() calls wait_for_completion_timeout(&xfer_done)
CPU0:
=> geni_spi_isr() starts
=> geni_spi_isr() calls complete(&xfer_done)
=> geni_spi_isr() stalls
CPU1:
=> spi_geni_set_cs() call to wait_for_completion_timeout() finishes
=> spi_geni_set_cs() exits.
=> spi_geni_transfer_one() is called
=> spi_geni_transfer_one() calls setup_fifo_xfer()
=> setup_fifo_xfer() sets "cur_mcmd"
=> setup_fifo_xfer() sets "tx_rem_bytes"
=> setup_fifo_xfer() sets "rx_rem_bytes"
=> setup_fifo_xfer() kicks off a transfer
CPU0:
=> geni_spi_isr() finishes stalling
=> geni_spi_isr() sets "cur_mcmd" to NULL
=> geni_spi_isr() checks "tx_rem_bytes" to confirm it's 0.
=> geni_spi_isr() checks "rx_rem_bytes" to confirm it's 0.
=> geni_spi_isr() clears any "DONE" interrupt that is pending

I can update the commit message to have that if it's helpful and makes
sense.  In the above example I have a fake "stall" that wouldn't
really happen, but in general if adding a delay somewhere creates a
race condition then the race condition was there anyway.  Also, with
weakly ordered memory it's possible that a write on one CPU could
clobber a write made by another CPU even if they happened in opposite
orders.

The race is fixed by my patch because when CPU1 starts
setup_fifo_xfer() it won't be able to grab the spinlock until the ISR
is totally done.

No need for a timeout to happen.  Just putting a few "trace_printk"
calls in the ISR at strategic places was enough for me to see the
race.

Sure, I'll fix in the next spin.
