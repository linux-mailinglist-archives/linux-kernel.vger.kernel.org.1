It definitely makes the code less complex. The additional memory is
minimal. In many cases you have already some space wasted at the end of
the object that could be used for the pointer.

Add it to the metadata at the end of the object. Like the debugging
information or the pointer for RCU freeing.

Both SLAB and SLUB have the same capabilities there. Slabs that had
different sizes before will now have different sizes as well. So the
merging does not change.

Sure. The main issue are the power of two kmalloc caches and how to add
the pointer to these caches in order not to waste memory. SLAB has done
this in the past by creating additional structues in a page frame.
