Hi

> Patch for enhacement of w1_therm module. Added features :
>  - Bulk read : send one command for all the slaves
>                  on the bus to trigger temperature conversion
>  - Optimized conversion time regarding to device resolution
>  - Dedicated sysfs entry for powering read,
>                  resolution set/get, eeprom save/restore
>  - Alarms settings and reading
>  - Code optimization to mitigate bus traffic
>                  (devices information are stored to avoid
>                 interrogating each device every-time)
>
> Following sysfs entry are added :
>  - temperature (RO) : return the temperature in 1/1000°
>  - ext_power (RO) : return the power status of the device
>  - resolution (RW) : get or set the device resolution (supported devices)
>  - eeprom (WO) :trigger a save or restore to/from device EEPROM
>  - alarms (RW) : read or write TH and TL in the device RAM
>  - therm_bulk_read (RW) : Attribute at master level to trigger
>                  bulk read and to survey the progress of devices conversions
>  - w1_slave has been kept for compatibility
>
> Main motivation was to improve temperature reading speed, which depend
> on resolution settings of devices. The module store the powwer status and
> the resolution of each device so that during reading operation, no
> transaction is required on the bus, which improve speed.
> The harware status is checked as soon as a new device is detected,
> when a user change occured, or when the corresponding sys file is
> accessed by user.
>
> The bulk read allow to trigger convserion of all devices on the bus at
> the same time. It will apply a strong pull up on the line if at least
> one device required it. The duration of the pull up is the max time
> required by a device on the line.

Looks good to me, thank you!
These are really good changes.

Greg, please pull it into your tree, thank you.
