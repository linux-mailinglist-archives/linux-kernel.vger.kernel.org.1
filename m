How could this be not board specific if there are at least three
different use cases the board can choose from - and needs three
different configurations:

(1) eMMC at /dev/mmcblk0, SD card at /dev/mmcblk1
(2) SD card at /dev/mmcblk0, eMMC at /dev/mmcblk1
(3) no eMMC at all, SD card at /dev/mmcblk0

your include only support (1). If a board needs (2) or (3) it has to
override the configuration in the _common_ include.

Still, why would this be enforced in the common include? What is the
advnatage here? I only see disadvantages.
