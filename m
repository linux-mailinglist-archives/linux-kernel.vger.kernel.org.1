Do you have a pointer to the device-tree for this system? I couldn't
spot anything amiss in the scarlet-inx DT, but I'm not sure the
system you have is that exact one. Even a DTB would help.

The fact that Kevin still boots is a good indication that the issue
could be with with the board-specific changes layered on top of the
GRU base. My own rk3399 systems are running with this patch.

Do you have "earlycon" on the kernel command-line?

No need to worry, and thank you for reporting the issue.

Could you try replacing the problematic patch with [1], and let me
know whether this changes anything on your end? This patch probably
isn't the right approach, but it would certainly help pointing me
in the right direction.

Thanks,

         M.
