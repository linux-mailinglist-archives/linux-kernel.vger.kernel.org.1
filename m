Can you pls cc these patches to dri-devel when they show up? Depending
upon how your hw works there's and endless amount of bad things that
can happen.

Also I think (again depending upon how the hw exactly works) this
stuff would be a perfect example for the dma_fence annotations.

The worst case is if your hw cannot preempt while a hw page fault is
pending. That means none of the dma_fence will ever signal (the amdkfd
preempt ctx fences wont, and the classic fences from amdgpu might be
also stall). At least when you're unlucky and the fence you're waiting
on somehow (anywhere in its dependency chain really) need the engine
that's currently blocked waiting for the hw page fault.

That in turn means anything you do in your hw page fault handler is in
the critical section for dma fence signalling, which has far reaching
implications.
