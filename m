Right.  Moreover, I feel like the enforced cow is not completely done in
hugetlbfs code even without this patch.  E.g., it lacks the proper return of
VM_FAULT_WRITE in hugetlb_cow(), and also the further convertion logics to
translate that into FOLL_COW (which, iiuc, should probably be done in
follow_hugetlb_page()).

I quickly went over the other FOLL_WRITE references and I didn't see any other
suspicious spots besides hugetlb (I only looked at the places that can be
called by __get_user_pages() though; that's the only place we set
FOLL_BREAK_COW after all).  At the meantime we ignored the fast gups for strict
breaking of cow always, so those ones seem ok too.

Thanks,
