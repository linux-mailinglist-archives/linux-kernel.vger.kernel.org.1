Hi Michael,

I am not sure if you would agree with me on this, but I am looking at the
purgatory code as work in progress. As mentioned in the cover note, I intend
to add log messaging, sha256 verification into purgatory. And also change it
to position independent executable after moving common purgatory code (sha256
verification) to arch-independent code.

When I initially took this up, I wanted to add all the above changes too, but
cut down on it, in the interest of time, first to get kdump (kexec -s -p)
working in v5.9 merge window.

But as the logic in patches 07/12 & 08/12 has been tested in kexec-tools code
a lot of times and there are unlikely to be any changes to them except for
__kexec_do_relocs() function (afaics), when -PIE would be used, I submitted them.
With patch 09/12, I tried for a change that uses relocations while is minimal
for now.

Would you prefer it to be absolutely minimal by dropping patches 7 & 8 for
now and writing the backup data copy code in assembler?

Thanks
Hari
