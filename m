This is getting tiresome. You want to play the code-quote game?

int irq_chip_pm_put(struct irq_data *data)
{
	int retval = 0;

	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PM) && data->chip->parent_device)
		retval = pm_runtime_put(data->chip->parent_device);

	return (retval < 0) ? retval : 0;
}

What is parent_device set to in your driver? Oh wait... Nothing.
So what does the code you quoted do? Not much.

I reject it because your approach is flawed, and that you are
papering over a glaring bug in your driver that you are refusing
to fix.

Maybe the right thing to do is to remove this driver from the code
base altogether. I will prepare a patch to that effect.
