I focused on separation and missed this case that the user sometimes
cannot know the object source (kmalloc/kmem_cache). At first step,
just checking whether it is a slab-object or not looks enough.

int kmem_valid_obj()

Yes, I prefer _obj().

I don't think so since it can be called without enabling the debug
option.

Okay. So, your code would be...

if (kmem_valid_obj(ptr))
        kmalloc_debug_print_provenance(ptr)
else if (vmalloc_valid_obj(ptr))
        ....

Looks good idea. I suggest a name, kmem_dump_obj(), for this function.
In this case, I don't think that "debug" keyword is needed since it shows
something useful (slab cache info) even if debug option isn't enabled.

So, for summary, we need to introduce two functions to accomplish your
purpose. Please correct me if wrong.

int kmem_valid_obj(ptr)
void kmem_dump_obj(ptr)

Thanks.
