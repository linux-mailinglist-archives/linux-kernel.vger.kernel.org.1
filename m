I guess my confusion was about "start_pos *is* fixed at 0": it certainly is
zero in the code right now, but when poking around while review the patch I
didn't see any reason that must be so.  Admittedly all I did was read the
prototype and function, so maybe I'm just missing something.  That said, if
it's all going away anyway then I don't really care either way.

As far as I can tell the patch set in question (the RISC-V one) doesn't change
any functionality.  I don't actually use GDB, but I haven't seen any issues
reported in a few years so if there is one I've missed it.

I did this ptrace stuff many years ago (IIRC it was actually my first RISC-V
Linux patch), and all I really remember is that it seemed way more complicated
than it needed to be.  I'm happy to just drop our patch set, as yours looks way
cleaner to me and if you're already planning on fixing put() then it doesn't
seem worth the churn.
