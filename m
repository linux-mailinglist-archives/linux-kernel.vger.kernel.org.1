Ah, I see, it was my first attempt to contribute and wasn't 100% sure, just
took the line from similar patches on the LKML. Thanks for the correction.

This is a longer story. It actually runs on hardware which is in production
for about 2-3 years, some use H2+ with full voltage regulators and some are
similar to the NanoPi DUO, where the voltage regulator can only switch
between 1.1 and 1.3 volts. It runs in two ways: A fully dynamic setup where
the ondemand scheduler is used and the second way where it is switched to
fixed values (based on load and temperature) using the cpufrequtils. The
devices running a 4.14.x kernel and are tested against 4.19.x kernels.
These devices are routers running a custom tcp/ip stack and have a high I/O
load. I also prepared devices based on a custom H3 design, which ran stable
at 1.392 GHz (but had passive coolers attached). Do these explanations
help?

Yeah, I noticed that in the beginning where I prepared the first kernels
for these devices. But after switching to multiples of 48MHz and bigger
steps these issues disappeared. I'm aware that this does not proof that
these issues do not appear, but thougth I share the values which I
consider stable.

Yeah, I know that. The u-boot running on the mentioned devices also have
these modifications, including a higher clocked DRAM (actually running at
624 MHz).

Oh, did I overlooked something? I was working on 4.14 up to 4.19 kernels
and may be a bit to eager to post the modifications.
