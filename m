No, the repply only explains how the interface might be used. There is
no prove that people would actually use it.

In short, this feature allows repeatedly enable/disable some
slowly growing maze of debug messages. Who need this, please? !!!

If I am debugging then I add/remove debug messages. But I never
enable/disable all of them repeatedly.

Also this is far from the original problem. It was about debugging
a single driver (venus, drm). In this case, people need something
easy to use. The following is the easy way:

   drm.debug = area_of_interest
   venus.debug = level_of_interest

   echo module=drm group=area_of_interest +p >control  [*]
   echo module=venus group=level_of_interes +p >control

Anyway, why filtering and 'u' flag would be necessary to debug these drivers?
Is anyone going to use it?

I would really like to hear the motivation for these features.
Has anyone asked for them?
Or are these just some "interesting" ideas from some brainstorming?


[*] Well, I wonder if the dyndbg interface would even be useful for drm
    because it it is actually split into many modules. So it might require
    creating/maintaining several filters.

PS: This is probably my last mail in this thread. It goes in cycle.
    You repeatedly explain how many possibilities the new features
    allow. I repeatedly doubt that they are worth it.

    I also proposed another solution for the original problem (venus)
    but it has never been commented.

    I just hope that these features will not get merged without
    a clear interest in them.
