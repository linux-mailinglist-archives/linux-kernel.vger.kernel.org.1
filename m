Well, I think the pattern

if (strstarts(option, <string>)) {
   ...
   option += strlen(<same string>);

is a bad one because one day <string> may get updated but not <same
string>.  And if <same string> is too far away in the code it might not
even show up in the diff, leading to reviewers not noticing either.  So
I think eliminating the pattern is a definite improvement.

Now whether the improvement is enough that we should churn the code
base to fix it is another question.
