Anyway, it is just some other more bugs I have to deal with, and I don=E2=

Thanks for sharing the script, this is very useful!

Note that [2] above is used, but optional:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200515150338.190344-5-elver@google.com/
It's not required for KCSAN to function correctly, but if it's
available it'll help find more data races with the default config.

Thanks,
