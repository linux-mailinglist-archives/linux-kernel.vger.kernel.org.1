Is that an issue with the standard mfd + regmap pattern?

For the AXP20x PMICs, we register the regmap in the parent mfd driver [1],
and store that in dev_data for child drivers to fetch [2]. You could
easily just fetch the regmap with dev_get_regmap() and a pointer to the
parent device.

The current MMIO syscon is decoupled from the DM, and there is no way
for drivers to export or register a syscon, meaning I have to open code
syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle() [3] if I want to only expose certain
registers and not the full address range, or if I want to share the
regmap with the existing driver (for locking purposes), or both [4].
Maybe there's room for improvement here? The same applies to the new
I2C case, and likely any other future syscon variants.

IMHO people are getting it wrong if they have both a syscon and a driver
for the same device.
