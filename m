Hi GVRao,

Sorry for the delayed reply.

The DSI-TX subsystem IP block is indeed an encoder from a hardware point
of view, but it's not necessarily the last block in the display
pipeline. While the output of the IP core goes of the the SoC, tt would
be entirely feasible to connect it to a DP to HDMI bridge on the board,
such as the ANX7737 ([1]) for instance. This is why we're pushing for
all encoder (from a hardware point of view) drivers to be implemented as
DRM bridge, in order to make them usable in different display pipelines,
without hardcoding the assumption they will be the last encoder in the
pipeline.
