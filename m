IRREVOCABLE COMPENSATION PAYMENT OF $750,000.00 DOLLARS VIA ATM VISA CARD

We sincerely apologize for the unnecessary delay of your compensation
payment. This delay was cursed due to the current EPIDEMIC outbreak
that frustrated all effort made to contact you. We have actually been
authorized by the newly appointed Minister of Finance and the
Governing Body of the UNITED NATIONS (UN) to investigate the
unnecessary delay of your payment. During the course of our
investigation, we discovered with dismay that your payment has been
unnecessarily delayed by corrupt officials of the Bank in an attempt
to swindle your fund which has led to so many losses from your end and
unnecessary delay in the receipt of your payment.

The United Nations has chosen to pay out all the unpaid contract,
compensation payment, inheritance fund and lotto winning claims by
Companies and individuals to 450 Beneficiaries from United Kingdom,
U.S.A, Europe, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, South America, Australia and Asia and Africa Continent through
ATM Visa Card as this is a global payments technology that enables
consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments to use
digital currency instead of Cash and Cheques.

You are hereby advised to stop dealing with some corrupt and
non-officials in the bank or any offices as this is an illegal act and
you have to stop if you so wish to receive your payment immediately.
We have arranged your payment to be paid to you through an ATM Visa
Card and this will be issued on your Name and shall be posted directly
to your address via DHL or any courier services available in your
country. Upon your contact with us, the sum of $750,000.00 Dollars
will be credited into the ATM Visa Card and this will enable you to
withdraw your funds in any ATM Machines in your country with a minimum
withdrawal of $5000.00 Dollars per day. Your limit can be increased to
any amount upon your request.

In this regards, you are to contact and furnish the requested
information to the Directorate of International Payment and Transfer
with the followings;
1. Your Name:
2. Country:
3. Age and Sex:
4. Occupation:
5. Mobile Telephone:
6. Delivery Address:
7. Id Card Identification:
We required your urgent response to this email as directed to avoid
further delay.

Director of International Payment
Mrs. Maria Angeles
