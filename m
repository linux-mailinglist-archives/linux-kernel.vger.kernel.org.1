Thanks to Okash's latest work, the TODO list is essentially empty, so
the way out from staging now seems open.

The status of the remaining issue mentioned in TODO is not clear, we
asked the speakup user mailing list for reproducer cases, but didn't get
a really specific scenario. One serious bug was fixed by 9d32c0cde4e2
("staging/speakup: fix get_word non-space look-ahead"), which does not
seem to really be related to the bug mentioned in TODO. Possibly the bug
mentioned in TODO has been fixed long ago and people have been thinking
that it was not because they can not distinguish the symptoms mentioned
in TODO from the symptoms of the bug fixed by 9d32c0cde4e2.

-Currently, speakup has several issues we know of.
+Currently, speakup has one issue we know of.
 
-The first issue has to do with the way speakup communicates with serial
-ports.  Currently, we communicate directly with the hardware
-ports. This however conflicts with the standard serial port drivers,
-which poses various problems. This is also not working for modern hardware
-such as PCI-based serial ports.  Also, there is not a way we can
-communicate with USB devices.  The current serial port handling code is
-in serialio.c in this directory.
-
-Some places are currently using in_atomic() because speakup functions
-are called in various contexts, and a couple of things can't happen
-in these cases. Pushing work to some worker thread would probably help,
-as was already done for the serial port driving part.
-
-There is a duplication of the selection functions in selections.c. These
-functions should get exported from drivers/char/selection.c (clear_selection
-notably) and used from there instead.
-
-The kobjects may have to move to a more proper place in /sys. The
-discussion on lkml resulted to putting speech synthesizers in the
-"speech" class, and the speakup screen reader itself into
-/sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon0/speakup, the nasty path being handled by
-userland tools.

-Another issue seems to only happen on SMP systems.  It seems
-that text in the output buffer gets garbled because a lock is not set.
-This bug happens regularly, but no one has been able to find a situation
-which produces it consistently.
