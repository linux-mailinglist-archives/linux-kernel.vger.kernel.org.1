Subject: [PATCH] kexec: Do not verify the signature without the lockdown or mandatory signature
Date:   Mon, 25 May 2020 13:23:51 +0800
Message-Id: <20200525052351.24134-1-lijiang@redhat.com>
X-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang 2.84 on 10.5.11.23

Signature verification is an important security feature, to protect
system from being attacked with a kernel of unknown origin. Kexec
rebooting is a way to replace the running kernel, hence need be
secured carefully.

In the current code of handling signature verification of kexec kernel,
the logic is very twisted. It mixes signature verification, IMA signature
appraising and kexec lockdown.

If there is no KEXEC_SIG_FORCE, kexec kernel image doesn't have one of
signature, the supported crypto, and key, we don't think this is wrong,
Unless kexec lockdown is executed. IMA is considered as another kind of
signature appraising method.

If kexec kernel image has signature/crypto/key, it has to go through the
signature verification and pass. Otherwise it's seen as verification
failure, and won't be loaded.

Seems kexec kernel image with an unqualified signature is even worse than
those w/o signature at all, this sounds very unreasonable. E.g. If people
get a unsigned kernel to load, or a kernel signed with expired key, which
one is more dangerous?

So, here, let's simplify the logic to improve code readability. If the
KEXEC_SIG_FORCE enabled or kexec lockdown enabled, signature verification
is mandated. Otherwise, we lift the bar for any kernel image.
