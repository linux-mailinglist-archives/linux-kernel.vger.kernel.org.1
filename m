And the sha1 is in the commit, showing which patch was reverted.

Sometimes, yes, but sometimes, as in this case, a totally different
patch will be submitted for the problem :)

But, even if it was there, the sha1 in the revert should allow us to
track this properly.  I can't remember a time where this has caused
problems in the past, can you?

Time and sha1 should show them being different :)
