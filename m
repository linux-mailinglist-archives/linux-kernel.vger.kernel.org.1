Thanks for the help and suggestions.

BTW: there are two more things below that I want to talk about.

1.Â  Recently, I have been focusing on the ARMv8.4-TTRem feature which is 
aimed at changing block size in stage 2 mapping.

I have a plan to implement this feature for stage 2 translation when 
splitting a block into tables or merging tables into a block.

This feature supports changing block size without performing 
*break-before-make*, which might have some improvement on performance.

What do you think about this?


2. Given that the issues we discussed before were found in practice when 
guest state changes from dirty logging to dirty logging canceled.

I could add a test file testing on this case to selftests/ or kvm unit 
tests/, if it's necessary.


Yanan
