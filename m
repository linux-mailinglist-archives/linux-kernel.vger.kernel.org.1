type "1804" is AUDIT_INTEGRITY_PCR which is used for failures to add to 
the measurement list.

The number in parenthesis is the error code (such as ENOMEM, EINVAL, 
etc.) IMA uses this format for reporting TPM errors in one of the audit 
messages (In ima_add_template_entry()). I followed the same pattern.

Would it be better if the value for "cause" is formatted as

    cause=hashing_error_-22

    cause=alloc_entry_-12
