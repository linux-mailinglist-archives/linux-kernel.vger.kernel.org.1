This is following the existing CoreSight bindings for ETM. The same driver
probes both. Also there can only ever be a single CPU for ete/etm. So, we
would prefer to keep it aligned with the existing bindings to avoid causing
confusion.

Will fix.

All CoreSight components require an out-ports and/or in-ports. The ETM/ETE
always has one port, but must be under out-ports in line with the CoreSight
bindings.

Does this look more apt:

    out-ports:
      description: |
        Output connection from the ETE to legacy CoreSight trace bus.
      poperties:
         port:
           $ref: /schemas/graph.yaml#/properties/port
