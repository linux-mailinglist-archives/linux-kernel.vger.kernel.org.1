Not a repost, but you're right, apparently there was a similar patch
posted before: 20191008122904.20438-1-m.malygin@yadro.com, which instead
triggers revalidation via configfs.

Fixed.

Right, this would be unset only during nvmet_ns_disable, and by that
time the ns is off the list, so identify should never see this being
non-NULL. Removed.

Fixed.

Indeed, I think it makes sense to fail identify at that point with
NVME_SC_INVALID_NS.

If you'd rather go with this patch instead of the configfs approach,
I'll post a v2 with the fixes, and some associated blktests that
Chaitanya requested.

Thank you all for the reviews!
