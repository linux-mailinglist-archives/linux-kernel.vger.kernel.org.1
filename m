Ok! Andrew, I would like to ask another question, how to correctly
define that this patch depends on a2c7023f7075c? I specified it in
human-readable part of commit description, but for backporting it would
also need some machine-readable format. So patch would not be
occasionally backported to older/stable kernel where a2c7023f7075c is
not available.
