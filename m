I guess let's avoid using the term "throttling", since in this context it 
sounds like we're talking about allocator throttling :-)

Let me rephrase: your statement is that it's not desirable "that some task 
would be throttled unexpectedly too long because of [the activity of another 
task also within that cgroup]" (let me know if that's not what you meant). But 
trying to avoid that requires knowing which activity abstractly instigates this 
entire mess in the first place, which we have nowhere near enough context to 
determine.
