Apologies for delay in my reply as I was busy with some other stuff.

It's not just about implementation differences but about terminology
as well. AFAIK about GUID, it's been typically used in Microsoft
centric softwares as compared to UUID which is generically defined by
RFC 4122.

AFAIU about the differences [1] among UUID and GUID, it seems like
UUID is a subset of GUID. IOW, we can't say that every GUID can be
represented as UUID as per RFC 4122.

So by using different terminology in the kernel with respect to a TEE
implementation is meant to cause more confusion among users than
difference in implementation details (like endianness).

The document which I shared wasn't OP-TEE specific but a generic TEE
specification defined by GlobalPlatform. And that spec doesn't put any
restrictions on UUID endianness. So it is very much possible that
another TEE implementation could implement UUID in big endian format
as the kernel does.

As mentioned above, using different terminology is meant to cause more
confusion than just difference in endianness which is manageable
inside TEE.

And I think it's safe to say that the kernel implements UUID in big
endian format and thus uses %pUb whereas OP-TEE implements UUID in
little endian format and thus uses %pUl.
