Then, I do not know what to do.


This board connection is so simple
that no hardware initialization needed to get access
to peripherals.

So, 'simple-bus' or 'simple-mfd' is preferred.

If this is not either simple-bus or simple-mfd,
I need a special driver to probe the
child devices such as ethernet, serial etc.



> What is it you're trying to describe in the device hierarchy?


The connection is as follows:


|-Main board -|      |----- add-on board ----|
|             |      |     (this board)      |
|             |      |                       |
|    (SoC) ---|------|--- CPLD --- ethernet  |
|             |      |          |- serial    |
|-------------|      |          |- LED       |
                     |                       |
                     |-----------------------|



uniphier-support-card.dtsi describes the
"add-on board" part.
Address-decode is implemented in CPLD.


So, the criteria to become MFD is
whether it is an IP integrated into SoC.


- implemented in an SoC  --> MFD

- implemented in a board + CPLD  --> not MFD


Right?

If I get rid of @NNNNNNNN part,
DTC warns the following for W=3D1 builds:

arch/arm/boot/dts/uniphier-support-card.dtsi:12.29-32.4: Warning
(unit_address_vs_reg): /soc/system-bus@58c00000/support-card: node has
a reg or ranges property, but no unit name



So, 'reg' or 'range' requires a unit name.

A unit name should be a base address.
If it has a chip select, the format is
<chip-select>,<base-address>

But the schema does not allow commas
in a unit name of simple-bus.

This is the problem I am trying to do something for.
