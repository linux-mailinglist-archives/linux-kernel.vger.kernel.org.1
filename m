Right, there are no more available SW PTE bits.

#define PTE_DIRTY               (_AT(pteval_t, 1) << 55)
#define PTE_SPECIAL             (_AT(pteval_t, 1) << 56)
#define PTE_DEVMAP              (_AT(pteval_t, 1) << 57)
#define PTE_PROT_NONE           (_AT(pteval_t, 1) << 58) /* only when !PTE_VALID */

Earlier I had proposed using PTE_SPECIAL at PMD level for this purpose.
But Catalin prefers these unused bits as the entry is anyway invalid
and which also leaves aside PTE_SPECIAL at mapped PMD for later use.
There is already one comment near PMD_PRESENT_INVALID definition which
explains this situation.

+/*
+ * This help indicate that the entry is present i.e pmd_page()
+ * still points to a valid huge page in memory even if the pmd
+ * has been invalidated.
+ */
+#define PMD_PRESENT_INVALID	(_AT(pteval_t, 1) << 59) /* only when !PMD_SECT_VALID */
