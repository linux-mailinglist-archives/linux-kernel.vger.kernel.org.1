This patchset adds the driver_override sysfs node, to let userspace
specify which driver (by name matching) to be bound to a device. The
driver "dfl-uio-pdev" doesn't provide an id_table, it could only be
bound to a device whose driver_override is set to "dfl-uio-pdev".

Sorry, this is actually not "normal". Usually dfl drivers with valid id_table
should be used to drive the dfl devices. But we also want to give an option
for userspace to take full control of the device, some IP blocks in FPGA are
written for specific purposes by FPGA user so a userspace driver may
serve them better.

Actually it is the userspace's decision which device they want to
access directly ...

I'm not sure if this idea is OK. I see similar implementation for
pci/platform devices.

Thanks,
