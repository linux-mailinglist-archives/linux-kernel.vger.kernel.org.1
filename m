Ah, OK, so it's just that the control bit itself has a terrible name :)

 From the available information I had assumed that this controlled the 
output attributes, and that the interconnect might then steer traffic 
based on those. Explaining a bit more clearly in the comment probably 
would be a good idea. In that case, I'd concur that the current logic is 
in fact appropriate, but please use the device_iommu_mapped() helper for 
cleanliness.

Cheers,
Robin.
