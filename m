Hi,

you should Сс a specialized mailing list and a relevant maintainer,
otherwise your email is likely to be ignored as LKML is an incredibly
high-volume list. Adding amd-gfx and Alex Deucher.

More thoughts below.

On the forum you show that in the "success" case there's one less "BIOS
signature incorrect" message. This implies that amdgpu_get_bios() in
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_bios.c
gets the video BIOS from a different source. If that happens every time
(one "signature incorrect" message for "success", two for "failure")
that may be relevant to the problem you're experiencing.

If you don't mind patching and rebuilding the kernel I suggest adding
debug printks to the aforementioned function to see exactly which methods
fail with wrong signature and which succeeds.

Also might be worthwhile to check if there's a BIOS update for your laptop.
