Yes, we handle that watchdog interrupt as a Group-0 interrupt, which is 
handled as fiq in EL3.

Sending a pseudo NMI IPI (to EL1) from fiq handler (which runs in EL3); 
I will check, but do you think, that might not work?

Before triggering SoC reset, we want to collect certain  EL1 debug 
information like stack trace for CPUs and other debug information.
