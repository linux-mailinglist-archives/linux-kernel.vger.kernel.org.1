Thank you for your comments!

But I think we don't need to update this patch because the current text
is better than suggested changes. I would rather to keep this patch
unchanged. Please see my following explanations for details.

This doc only refers to the latest specs. Older specs are not useful
for this spec.

This doc only covers ENQCMD. ENQCMDS is out of scope of this doc.

Kernel IOMMU does use PASID context. So we would keep the current text.

I think they are same/similar concepts. No need to duplicate here.

The DMA access from device to the process address space uses the same PASID
set up in the MSR.

We use address to match the "address space" specified in the term of PASID.
page table is implementation details. So we would keep the current text.

The MSR refers to MSR_IA32_PASID. We don't need to repeat long
"MSR_IA32_PASID" everywhere while a short "the MSR" is better and clear
in the doc.

The "MSR" is better because we focus on the MSR value here that is set up for
each thread.

No. It is PASID that is cleared per process creation. We are not talking about
the MSR here although the MSR will cleared as part of process FPU init.

bind() is better because the binding function may be changed (e.g. it was
changed in 5.8). People know bind() means binding. Even in the future the
binding function is changed again, we don't need to change the text here
if using bind().

Using "since" is better. It explains "why".

Ditto. It's unnecessary to use long "MSR_IA32_PASID" everywhere.
"The MSR" is concise and clear.

Thanks.
