To have the code validated by objtool like any other alternative code
(which is not tagged with ANNOTATE_NOSPEC_ALTERNATIVE).

objtool doesn't currently warn on stack changes inside alternatives.
The RSB/retpoline alternatives have warning because objtool doesn't
support retpoline ret and intra-function calls. If you have an alternative
doing stack changes that objtool understand (like push/pop, add/remove
to sp) then you won't have a warning.

I think that's the case with smap_save:

static __always_inline unsigned long smap_save(void)
{
         unsigned long flags;

         asm volatile (ALTERNATIVE("", "pushf; pop %0; " __ASM_CLAC,
                                   X86_FEATURE_SMAP)
                       : "=rm" (flags) : : "memory", "cc");

         return flags;
}

The alternative does change the stack but objtool won't complain
because it handles the pushf and pop instruction.
