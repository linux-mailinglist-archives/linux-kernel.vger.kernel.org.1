To be formal, /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteprocX/state takes a "stop" operation
and a newly added "detach" operation.

That is entirely up to the platform driver and the requirements of the system.
That is why rproc_shutdown() and rproc_detach() return an error code to be
conveyed to the sysfs mechanic.

That is correct.  It is the simplest heuristic that I could come up with,
leaving opportunities to make enhancement as we see fit.

That is why I wanted to leave crash scenarios out of this set.  What happens
when the system crashes will follow the same heuristic we decide to enact in
rproc_del().

Yes, that is one way to proceed.  The downside of this approach is that platform
drivers would be responsible for setting rproc->state.  I am not totally opposed
to proceed this way but would like to explore other avenues before committing to
that solution.

On that note, did we talk about using the DT before?  That would be very easy,
simple and flexible.  Anyways, deciding what to do will take time hence keeping
this set to an absolute minimum.

Yes, the device tree is a definite possibility.

Thanks for the input,
