Sure.

Oh you are right...  I just noticed that VM_FAULT_BADMAP and VM_FAULT_BADACCESS
can never returned in handle_mm_fault() itself.

Anyway, glad to know that we've reached consensus so that we can accept these
differences.

Since this patch seems to be the only one that needs a new post so far, I'll
repost this patch only by replying to itself with v2.1.  Hopefully that can
avoid some unecessary mail bombs.

Thanks for the very detailed review!
