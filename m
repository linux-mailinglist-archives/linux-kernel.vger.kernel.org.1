The main use case i have in mind is to inform the userspace that the remote
processor has crashed. This would allow applications to perform specific action
to avoid getting stuck and/or resetting it's environement befor restarting the
remote processor and associated IPC.
If i well remember QCOM has this kind of mechanism for its modem but this is
implemented in a platform driver.
We would be interested to have something more generic relying on the remoteproc
framework.

Thanks,
Arnaud
