Yes it does. I guess I have provided enough reasoning for that. Also,
the rename commit itself illustrates its importance and clarifies the
use case for which they are meant to be used.

It's not about me being happy but more about confusion and
inconsistency it will bring.

IMO, either kernel should be opinionated about UUID endianness like
currently it is:

uuid_t and its corresponding helpers (eg. UUID_INIT) follows BE format.

or support both endianness for UUID (no common type: uuid_t) like we
had earlier prior to rename commit:

uuid_be_t and its corresponding helpers (eg. UUID_BE_INIT) follow BE format.
uuid_le_t and its corresponding helpers (eg. UUID_LE_INIT) follow LE format.

But even if we consider later case as well, I am still not sure if we
can switch to uuid_le_t as it's been part of TEE core ABI
(open_session) where UUID is passed in BE format (see LE to BE
conversion in TEE client [1] and vice-versa in OP-TEE OS [2]) and
won't be a backwards compatible change.
