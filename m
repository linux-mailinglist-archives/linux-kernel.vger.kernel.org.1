Hi Paul,

This is great!

I understand it's not a sufficiently challenging way of tracking
things, but it's simply here ;)
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=208299
(now we also know who asked for this, +Jann)

I've tested on the latest mainline and with rcupdate.rcu_expedited=1
it boots to ssh successfully and I see:
[    0.369258][    T0] All grace periods are expedited (rcu_expedited).

I have created https://github.com/google/syzkaller/pull/2021 to enable
it on syzbot.
On syzbot we generally use only 2-4 CPUs per VM, so it should be even better.

The problem is that it's hard to remember bugs that were not caught :)
Here is an approximation of UAFs with free in rcu callback:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/syzkaller-bugs/KASAN$20use-after-free$20rcu_do_batch%7Csort:date
The ones with low hit count are the ones that we almost did not catch.
That's the best estimation I can think of. Also potentially we can get
reproducers for such bugs without reproducers.
Maybe we will be able to correlate some bugs/reproducers that appear
soon with this change.
