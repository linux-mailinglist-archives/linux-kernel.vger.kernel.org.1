It might, especially if the call_rcu() rate is lower after the
rcu_barrier() than it was beforehand.  Which might well be the case when
a large cleanup activity ended just before rcu_barrier() was invoked.

It is true that kmemleak could decide that being passed to call_rcu()
as being freed.  However, it would need to know the rcu_head offset.
And there are (or were) a few places that pass linked structures to
call_rcu(), and kmemleak would presumably need to mark them all free
at that point.  Or maybe accept the much lower false-positive rate from
not marking them.

Looking forward to hearing how it goes!
