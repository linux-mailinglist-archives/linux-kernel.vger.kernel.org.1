I can see that you have provided some more details in follow up replies
but I do not see any explicit argument why an excessive time for writer
is an actual problem. Could you be more specific?

If the writer is time sensitive then there is a trivial way to
workaround that and kill it by a signal (timeout 30s echo ....).

Btw. this behavior has been considered http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200710122917.GB3022@dhcp22.suse.cz/
"
With this change
the reclaim here might be just playing never ending catch up. On the
plus side a break out from the reclaim loop would just enforce the limit
so if the operation takes too long then the reclaim burden will move
over to consumers eventually. So I do not see any real danger.

Why is this worth backporting to stable? The behavior is different but I
do not think any of them is harmful.

I am not against the patch. The existing interface doesn't provide any
meaningful feedback to the userspace anyway. User would have to re check
to see the result of the operation. So how hard we try is really an
implementation detail.
