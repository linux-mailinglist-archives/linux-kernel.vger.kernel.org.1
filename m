I can rename it and have it documented in the mhi_prepare_for_transfer() 
API
that we actually already start the channel, so it is not required to be 
used
at first. I can improve this documentation in mhi.h as a separate patch.

Later, if a client driver wants to issue stop and start commands, it can 
do so.
I'm not too picky with the name. Maybe Mani or someone else may have 
more
comments.

Thanks for looking in to this.
