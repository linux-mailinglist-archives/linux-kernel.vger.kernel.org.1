Sure. Couple of example:
Cont Code   Identifier       Manufacturer
0		0x1		AMD
0		0x0e		Freescale (Motorola)
4		0x3b		ARM

I initially thought of value like "jep106-0-1" for AMD "jep-4-3b" for
ARM,..etc for the standard attribute family or machine. But I was not
convinced fully on that approach as it will be deviation from normal
values in those attributes. Further this represents the vendor name
rather than the family or machine.

That may be possible, I can take a look at the existing drivers and
check if that is feasible(which I think should be). Thanks for that
suggestion.
