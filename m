AFAICT, the only difference here is that it's the kernel memory
registered rather than user-space memory. But I am not very conversant
with the Xen environment. So I hope you will be able to find the root
cause as to why Xen is blocking this invocation.

Warning prints aren't much useful in the sense that they can't be
detected via current OP-TEE CI.

Since it seems like currently the kernel internal interface is broken
with virtualization support. So how about "plan B" being skipping the
enumeration in case "OPTEE_SMC_SEC_CAP_VIRTUALIZATION" is set? As we
can't expect to get TEE kernel drivers working without getting this
interface fixed. Also, having an information message that the kernel
internal interface is not supported with virtualization would be
useful too.
