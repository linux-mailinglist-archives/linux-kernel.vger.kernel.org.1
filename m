Ouch!!!  And what on earth is Germany doing being that warm???

I must confess that I was not expecting to find anything resembling
happiness anywhere down this road, whether for myself or anyone else...

I was not considering any approach other than return NULL just before
the code would otherwise have acquired zone->lock.

Understood, and agreed:  We do need to keep the RT degradation in check.

I have no objection to an otherwise objectionable name in this particular
case.  After all, we now have 100 characters per line, right?  ;-)

Understood.  I confess that I have but little understanding of that code.

Why not wait until someone has an extremely good reason for needing
this functionality from the slab allocators?  After all, leaving out
the slab allocators would provide a more robust defense line.  Yes,
consistent APIs are very good things as a general rule, but maybe this
situation is one of the exceptions to that rule.

Checks for that GFP_ variant could be added to automation, though reality
might eventually prove that to be a mixed blessing.
