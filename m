Also, 'some module' vs 'some other module' doesn't really say
anything. Please explain which modules and their sizes.

Would it help to check the section index here as well? Call/jump
instructions within a section are never sent through a PLT entry.

ADRP PLTs cannot be deduplicated, as they incorporate a relative jump
back to the caller.

Agreed.

Also, what's wrong with [] array indexing?
