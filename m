Lots of broken virtio implementations out there it would seem :-(

Would you be in favor of a more flexible check along the lines of the
one proposed in the patch that started this thread:

    if (xen_vring_use_dma())
            return true;


xen_vring_use_dma would be implemented so that it returns true when
xen_swiotlb is required and false otherwise.
