What are the types used for before_stamp and write_stamp ? If those
are 64-bit integers, how does sharing them between nested contexts
work on 32-bit architectures ?

You should use the term "interrupt" rather than "preempting", because as you
stated yourself, this algorithm only works with nested interrupts, not with
preemption.

So the reservation is not "just" an add instruction, it's actually an xadd on
x86. Is that really faster than a cmpxchg ?

What does "a" refer to ? What triggers its update ?

If it's a slow path, why try to play games with a delta timestamp ? Space
should not be an issue for a slow path like this. It would be simpler to just
use the full timestamp here.

You mean nesting after [C] but before [D].

It's -> Its

What worries me about this "optimization" is what happens in a multi-nesting scenario.
If we just fallback to a full timestamp as soon as nesting is detected, things become
really simple for multiple nesting. However using a delta timestamp adds a lot of
additional states to consider, and those are not discussed here.

More specifically, one scenario I'm concerned about is:

Nesting level 0                      Nesting level 1                      Nesting level 2

[A] w = local_read(write_tail);
    before = READ_ONCE(before_stamp);
[B] WRITE_ONCE(before_stamp, ts);
    WRITE_ONCE(next_write, w + len);
[C] write = local_add_return(len,
    write_tail);
   <interrupted>
                                    [A] w = local_read(write_tail);
                                        before = READ_ONCE(before_stamp);
                                    [B] WRITE_ONCE(before_stamp, ts);
                                    <interrupted>
                                                                          [A] w = local_read(write_tail);
                                                                              before = READ_ONCE(before_stamp);
                                                                          [B] WRITE_ONCE(before_stamp, ts);
                                                                              WRITE_ONCE(next_write, w + len);
                                                                          [C] write = local_add_return(len,
                                                                              write_tail);
                                                                              if (w == tail) { -> true
                                                                                if (!abs) { -> false
                                                                                  if (w == next) { -> true

Nesting level 2 then ends up using the "before_stamp" of nesting level 1 to generate
the time delta, but the delta is really between the event from nesting level 0 and the
event at nesting level 2, because nesting level 1 will only record its event _after_
the event of nesting level 2.

This sentence is hard to parse.

What is the type of write_stamp, and how does it work on 32-bit architectures with
NMIs ?

I'm not entirely sure to understand what this cmpxchg try to accomplish. Moreover,
what happens if right after an interrupt nests between [C] and [E], another interrupt
try to write into the buffer after before that cmpxchg ?

If this is a rare case, why not just use a full timestamp instead ?
