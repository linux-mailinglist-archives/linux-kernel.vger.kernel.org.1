One idea that came up at the previous audio conference regarding this
implementation was to just allow SET_PARAMS during the stream is
running (only if the driver sets the capability) instead of
introducing yet a new ioctl and an ops.
Would it make sense?

I have no big objection to add a new ioctl if other people agree,
though.
