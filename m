I'm not quite sure I get that part. From the link you mentionned above,
the NMI is the interrupt 0 for all the SoCs, so we shouldn't have any
number lower?

As far as I know, upstream we only ever use the 0 interrupt for the AXP,
so it should be fairly easy to come up with a numbering scheme that is
backward compatible with that.

It's probably a bit of a non-answer, but I guess all the devices for
which it makes sense? The ethernet / USB controllers that you already
mentionned would make sense, the GPIO banks too, possibly the UARTs?

I guess we could just enable most of the one that makes sense at first,
and then discuss cases we didn't consider as we discover them?
