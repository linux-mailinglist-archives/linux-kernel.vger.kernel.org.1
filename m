There are still people who care about the architecture and try to get fixes in:

  https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-sh/msg56844.html

Alas, I haven't had better luck getting Rich's attention, and I say that as
someone who has his phone number.

It met Sato-san for lunch once years ago, but he lives in Tokyo and english is
not his first language. I was under the impression he became co-maintainer to
show Rich the ropes of maintainership and to answer obscure architectural
questions, not because he was volunteering for significantly more work. Rich was
supposed to be load bearing.

I don't really have the domain expertise to do it myself... :(
