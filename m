Because from my experience there are not tons of charges inside one
syscall usually. Yeah, some syscalls can generate a lot of them but that
shouldn't be a majority.

That is not what I meant. We do have some throttling inside the reclaim
because failing reclaim too quickly can easily lead to pre mature OOMs.
If that doesn't work then we should have a look why. E.g. it is quite
unexpected to have large LRU full of dirty pages because this suggests
that dirty throttling doesn't work properly.

Just imagine that you have parallel producers increasing the high limit
excess while somebody reclaims those. Sure in practice the loop will be
bounded but the reclaimer might perform much more work on behalf of
other tasks.
