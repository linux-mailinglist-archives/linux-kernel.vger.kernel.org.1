We should explain the difference between the two values. It might be
enough to add something like:

    See "Descriptor Finalization" section for more details."

This looks like a hack. And similar extra check of the bit is needed
also in desc_read(), see
https://lore.kernel.org/r/878sdvq8kd.fsf@jogness.linutronix.de

I has been actually getting less and less happy with the inconsistency
between names of the bits and states.

Sigh, you will hate me because this would mean a bigger change.
IMHO, it would be much cleaner and help with long-term maintainability
when we do the following two changes:

First, define 5 desc_states, something like:

enum desc_state {
	desc_miss = -1,		/* ID mismatch */
	desc_modified =	 0x0,	/* reserved, being modified by writer */
	desc_committed = 0x1,	/* committed by writer, could get reopened */
	desc_finalized = 0x2,	/* committed, could not longer get modified */
	desc_reusable =	 0x3,	/* free, not yet used by any writer */
};

Second, only 4 variants of the 3 state bits are currently used.
It means that two bits are enough and they might use exactly
the above names:

I mean to do something like:

#define DESC_SV_BITS		(sizeof(unsigned long) * 8)
#define DESC_SV(desc_state)	((unsigned long)desc_state << (DESC_SV_BITS - 2))
#define DESC_ST(state_val)	((unsigned long)state_val >> (DESC_SV_BITS - 2))


Then we could have:

static enum desc_state get_desc_state(unsigned long id,
				      unsigned long state_val)
{
	if (id != DESC_ID(state_val))
		return desc_miss;

	return DESC_ST(state_val);
}

and use in the code:

unsigned long val_committed = id | DESC_SV(desc_committed);


or do

#define DESC_SV(id, desc_state)	(id | (unsigned long)desc_state << (DESC_SV_BITS - 2))

and then use DESC_SV(id, DESC_COMMITTED).


I am sorry that I did not came up with this earlier. I know how
painful it is to rework bigger patchsets. But it affects format
of the ring buffer, so we should do it early.

Best Regards,
Petr

PS: I am still middle of review. It looks good so far. I wanted to
send this early and separately because it is a bigger change.
