In recent kernels there was a feature to function trace modules before
they are loaded, but that feature isn't yet available on mainline. I
could add it when I get a chance, but that wont be in the near future.

Also, the function graph wont work for that either, as that isn't set
up to preload before functions. But since you have
ftrace_graph_max_depth of one, you don't need the graph, the limiting
of the function (set_ftrace_filter) is good enough. But again, that
only works after boot up.

Well, it's just like writing something not acceptable in the filter
functions. If it fails, it does not filter. So yes, it is expected
behavior.
