I do not think we should support anything but Zone Append, especially not
the new TP, which is going to add even more horrible code for absolutely
no good reason.

I really don't have a problem with that.  If these OEMs want to use
an inferior access model only, they have to pay the price for it.
I also don't think that proxy arguments are very useful.  If you OEMs
are troubled by carrying patches becomes they decided to buy inferior
drivers they are perfectly happy to argue their cause here on the list.

As said I do not think implementing zone append emulation or the TP that
shall not be named are a good idea for Linux.
