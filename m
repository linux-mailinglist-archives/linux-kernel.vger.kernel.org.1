Well, as I wrote to you in one of the replies. IMO pagevec unnecessarily
complicate matters and we should rather have for_each_mapping_page() and
for_each_mapping_entry() magic macros that hide pagevecs inside. Most of
users process returned pages/entries one by one so these macros would
simplify them. So it would seem better to me to go more into this direction
than to spread pagevecs...
