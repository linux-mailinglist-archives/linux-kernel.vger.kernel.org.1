Hi,

the legacy Mips SoC had a External Bus Unit (EBU), similar to an 
Intel/Hitachi style bus. It was used back then for lots of things, 
sometimes driving Leds via 74* latches, Arcadyan used it for external 
reset lines and very rarely was it used for nand.

Looking at this series and comparing it with xway_nand.c we see that the 
init sequence is near identical. Best guess is that the mountain lion 
uses an internal block very similar to what the legacy mips silicon used 
just in a newer generation and the new proposed driver is more feature 
complete.

If this is the case ideally the xway_nand.c is dropped and that silicon 
is made working with the newer driver. Chances are that we just need to 
add a "support less features" style flag.

Unfortunately i no longer have the evalkit for the Mips SoCs.

    John
