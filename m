Hi Artus,

Yes, I'm just too busy right now.

My plan/backlog is:

- the xarray patch from Matthew

- improve finding max_id in ipc_rmid(). Perhaps even remove max_id 
entirely and instead calculate it on demand.

- your patch to avoid waking up too many tasks, including my bugfix.

My biggest problem is always realistic benchmarks:

Do we optimize for code size/small amount of branches, or add special 
cases for things that we think could be common?

Avoiding thundering herds is always good, avoiding schedule() is always 
good.

Thus I would start with pipelined_receive, and then we would need 
feedback from apps that use sysv msg.

(old fakeroot is what I remember as test app)
