I know, and I was pretty much expecting you to bring that up...

To be fair, this place is really the only place that is a bit tricky, since
it's where we restore things. The rest is clear, since we know exactly
which poll (&req->poll, or req->apoll) that is being used. The fix from
last week ended up somewhat conflicting with the cancellation part, which
is part of the reason it slipped.

But I do hear your point. If we run into anything like this again, I'll
bite the bullet and un-unionize this thing. I just care pretty deeply
about keeping the footprint of a single io_uring request down to as
little as we can, as we can be doing millions of these (per core). We've
still got some room in terms of not spilling into the next cacheline.
