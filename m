We have two systems. One uploads the FPGA firmware via SPI passive
serial mode (compatible fpga-arria10-passive-serial). The other system
has a ftdi FT232H USB/serial converter chip working in synchronous FIFO
mode, connected to the FPGA via a CPLD. The series from Anatolij Gustchin
here https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/10824743/ would have been useful
for us, although of course our CPLD has a different protocol. On this
system we currently ended up with a small custom driver which bypasses
FPGA manager and only uploads the firmware at USB connect time.

On both systems It's one PCI device only. Currently we don't need runtime
re-programming, although this might be useful in the future. Also there's
no partial reconfiguration.
