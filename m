Any of that would be easy to backport, though.  Several questions
regaring XSAVE and friends:

* do we ever run on XSAVE/XSAVES-capable hardware with XFEATURE_FP
turned off?

* is it possible for x86 to have gaps between the state components
area as reported by CPUID 0x0d?  IOW, can area for feature 2
(XFEATURE_YMM) to start *not* at 0x200 and can area for N start
not right after the end of area for N-1 for some N > 2?

I think I have an easy-to-backport solution, but I'm really confused
about XFEATURE_FP situation...
