Let's leave it as is -- An FPGA is one possible implementation and as for
other buses, you wouldn't call it fpga-usb or usb-fpga just because the
USB bus is implemented in an FPGA if it behaves like a normal USB bus.
Having an ASIC based DFL bus show up under dfl-fpga / fpga-dfl in sysfs
would be super confusing.

DFL is a pretty efficient implementation in terms of resource
utilization on the FPGA end (a couple of registers / memories) vs
several kilobytes of memory for a device-tree blob.

The hardware using DFL to describe its internal structure exists in the
form of deployed accelerator cards and telling all its users to go and
change their hardware design would be feasible -- If you think about an
FPGA as a (albeit reconfigurable) ASIC you wouldn't go and tell people
to redesign their ASIC to use Device-Tree? :)

I'm not sure where the 'sneaking in' anything comes from. It's been
reviewed on the list (and by yourself back then). If you feel any of
this wasn't kosher, let's talk about it, to make sure it doesn't happen
again.

Cheers,
Moritz
