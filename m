Had introduced this member to handle case where new fields are added to
'struct nd_pdsm_cmd_pkg' without having to break the ABI. But agree with
the point that you made later that this can be simplified by replacing
'payload_offset' with a set of reserved variables. Will address this in
next iteration of this patchset.

Agree, that this function should have more strict checking for
payload_offset field. However will be getting rid of
'payload_offset' all together in the next iteration as you previously
suggested.

Yes this is already being done in the patchset and changes proposed to
this pdsm_cmd_to_payload() should not impact other patches as
pdsm_cmd_to_payload() abstracts rest of the code from how to access the
payload.

Agree to this and will address this in V8.
