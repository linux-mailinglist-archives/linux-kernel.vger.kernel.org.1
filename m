Whatever you all decide on, note that "sifive,<block><num>" is a SiFive 
thing (as it is documented) and <num> corresponds to tag of the IP 
implmentation (at least it is supposed to). So you can't just copy that 
with 'riscv,<block><num>' unless you have the same IP versioning 
and update the documentation.

Using a spec version is fine, but not standalone. You need 
implementation specific compatible too because no one perfectly 
implements any spec and/or there details a spec may not cover.
