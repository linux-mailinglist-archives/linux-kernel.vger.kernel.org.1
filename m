The regs frames aren't for function/procedure calls, but rather
exceptions/interrupts.

If for example arm64 were to switch to ORC, it could have regs-only
frames in entry code just like x86.

If we called it TYPE_REGS_PARTIAL, at least the name would be generic
enough, even if it's not used by all arches.

Ok, I guess I'd need to look at the code to have an opinion.  If there
turn out to be commonalities between the different arch unwind hints
then we could always unify them later.
