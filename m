right, that's what we do for other options

I think it's better for future.. say if there's going to be support
for passing file paths you'll need to add something like --ctl-fifo
and --ctl-fifo-ack no?  with single option we'd just add something
like:

  --control fifo:/tmp/my-perf.fifo,/tmp/my-perf-ack.fifo
