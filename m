Thanks for the report. Yes, I know this is a potential problem since 3.19 and
this is a practical problem since 4.18, as explained at
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/f8099e95-c0fc-d133-471e-e0ba97d2230e@i-love.sakura.ne.jp .

It seems that Al wants to change __do_execve_file(), as commented at
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200329031702.GB23230@ZenIV.linux.org.uk .
Bringing tomoyo_realpath_nofollow() to __do_execve_file() (in other words,
solve AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW path and !AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW path at the same
time) will be the right (from the perspective of race-free) solution. But
I don't know an API that allows resolving !AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW path starting
 from AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW path. I need to wait for Al, for I can't implement
race-free solution from TOMOYO side.
