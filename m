ÔÚ 2020/4/21 ÉÏÎç6:11, Johannes Weiner Ð´µÀ:
> The try/commit/cancel protocol that memcg uses dates back to when
> pages used to be uncharged upon removal from the page cache, and thus
> couldn't be committed before the insertion had succeeded. Nowadays,
> pages are uncharged when they are physically freed; it doesn't matter
> whether the insertion was successful or not. For the page cache, the
> transaction dance has become unnecessary.
> 
> Introduce a mem_cgroup_charge() function that simply charges a newly
> allocated page to a cgroup and sets up page->mem_cgroup in one single
> step. If the insertion fails, the caller doesn't have to do anything
> but free/put the page.
> 
> Then switch the page cache over to this new API.
> 
> Subsequent patches will also convert anon pages, but it needs a bit
> more prep work. Right now, memcg depends on page->mapping being
> already set up at the time of charging, so that it can maintain its
> own MEMCG_CACHE and MEMCG_RSS counters. For anon, page->mapping is set
> under the same pte lock under which the page is publishd, so a single
> charge point that can block doesn't work there just yet.
> 
> The following prep patches will replace the private memcg counters
> with the generic vmstat counters, thus removing the page->mapping
> dependency, then complete the transition to the new single-point
> charge API and delete the old transactional scheme.
