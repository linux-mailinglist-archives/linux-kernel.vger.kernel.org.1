Interesting.  This appears to have affected well over 100 function
definitions in the docs, and nobody ever noticed.  Good to know we're all
reading it closely :)

Applied, thanks.

Thinking about 3.0 is on my list, but I've not gotten there yet.  I really
wish they wouldn't break things like that...
