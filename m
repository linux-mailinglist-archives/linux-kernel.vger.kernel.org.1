I have a feeling this isn't very nice to CFS tasks, since we would now
"waste" load-balance attempts if they happen to coincide with an RT task
being runnable.

On your 72 CPUs machine, the system-wide balance happens (at best) every
72ms if you have idle time, every ~2300ms otherwise (every balance
CPU gets to try to balance however, so it's not as horrible as I'm making
it sound). This is totally worst-case scenario territory, and you'd hope
newidle_balance() could help here and there (as it isn't gated by any
balance interval).

Still, even for a single rq, postponing a system-wide balance for a
full balance interval (i.e. ~2 secs worst case here) just because we had a
single RT task running when we tried to balance seems a bit much.

It may be possible to hack something to detect those cases and reset the
interval to "now" when e.g. dequeuing the last RT task (& after having
previously aborted a load-balance due to RT/DL/foobar).

Seeing as that can be RT, DL or stopper, that name is somewhat misleading.
