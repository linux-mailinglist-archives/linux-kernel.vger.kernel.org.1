Okay, we are now talking about the HPC special case. Just brain-storming some
ideas here.


1) What about increase the soft-lockup threshold early at boot and restore
afterwards? As far as I can tell, those soft-lockups are just a few bursts of
things and then cure itself after the booting.

2) Reading through the comments above page_waitqueue(), it said rare hash
collisions could happen, so sounds like in this HPC case, it is rather easy to
hit those hash collisons. Thus, need to deal with that instead?

3) The commit 62906027091f ("mm: add PageWaiters indicating tasks are waiting
for a page bit") mentioned that,

"Putting two bits in the same word opens the opportunity to remove the memory
barrier between clearing the lock bit and testing the waiters bit, after some
work on the arch primitives (e.g., ensuring memory operand widths match and
cover both bits)."

Do you happen to know if this only happen on powerpc? Also, probably need to
dig out if those memory barrier is still there that could be removed to speed
up things.
