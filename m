Sorry for breaking the driver with this change, but now I think we
should have all ECC related bits in ->attach() instead of ->probe().
The ->attach() hook is called during the nand_scan() operation and at
this point the chip's requirements/layout are known (not before). I
know that certain controllers don't really care about that, here your
simply hardcode these two fields and you don't need to know anything
about the chip's properties. But as a bid to harmonize all drivers with
the target of a generic ECC engine in mind, I think it's now time to
move these three lines (chip->ecc.* = ...) at the top of ->attach().
Also, these fields should have been populated by the core so perhaps
the best approach is to check if the user requirements are synced with
the controller's capabilities and error out otherwise?

We plan to send a fixes PR for -rc2, if the v2 arrives today I'll
integrate it.

Thanks,
Miqu√®l
