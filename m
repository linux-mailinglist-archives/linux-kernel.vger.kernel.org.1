I agree on principle, this makes more sense to use the file's fid.

Just a comment below, but while I'm up in commit message I'll also be
annoying with it -- please try to fix grammar mistakes for next
patches/version (mostly missing some 'be' for future passive form; but I
don't understand why you use future at all and some passive forms could
probably be made active to simplify... Anyway we're not here to discuss
English grammar but words missing out is sloppy and that gives a bad
impression for no good reason)

hmm, normally setattr cannot happen on a file that hasn't been opened so
private_data should always be set, but it doesn't cost much to play safe
and check? e.g. something like this is more conservative:

struct p9_fid *fid = NULL;
...
if (iattr->ia_valid & ATTR_FILE) {
	fid = iattr->ia_file->private_data;
	WARN_ON(!fid);
}
if (!fid)
	fid = v9fs_fid_lookup(dentry);



What do you think?
