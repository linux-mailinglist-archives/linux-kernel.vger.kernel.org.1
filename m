Bah, I was afraid of that. I desperately tried to find correspondence on
it, but alas, verbal crap doesn't end up in the Sent folder :-/

Moo... that really could've done with a comment I suppose.

So then I don't understand the !->owner issue, that only happens when
the task dies, which cannot be concurrent with event creation. Are you
somehow accessing ->owner later?

As for the kernel events.. why do you care about the actual task_struct
* in there? I see you're using it to grab the task-pid, but how is that
useful?
