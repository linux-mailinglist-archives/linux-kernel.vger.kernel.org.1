Definetly!

I was only commenting on the barrier suggestion. But I believe it shouldn't
be needed in the end.

If we were to have a per task work for thread timers and a per process work
for process timers, that means we would need to cut down the whole thing, and also
take care about timers firing after exit_task_work(), which isn't an issue
in the thread case as the work will simply be ignored for an exiting task but
it's a big issue in the case of process wide handling.

Anyway, the current layout is simple enough.
