Actually, the code does not make the assumption that hugetlb_add_hstate
is called from arch specific huge page setup.  It can even be called later
at the time of hugetlb command line processing.

My 'reasoning' is that gigantic pages can currently be preallocated from
bootmem/memblock_alloc at the time of command line processing.  Therefore,
we should be able to reserve bootmem for CMA at the same time.  Is there
something wrong with this reasoning?  I tested this on x86 by removing the
call to hugetlb_add_hstate from arch specific code and instead forced the
call at command line processing time.  The ability to reserve CMA was the
same.

Yes, the CMA reservation interface says it should be called from arch
specific code.  However, if we currently depend on the ability to do
memblock_alloc at hugetlb command line processing time for gigantic page
preallocation, then I think we can do the CMA reservation here as well.

Thinking about it some more, I suppose there could be some arch code that
could call hugetlb_add_hstate too early in the boot process.  But, I do
not think we have an issue with calling it too late.
