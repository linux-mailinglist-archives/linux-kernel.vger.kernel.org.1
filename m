Sure. I honestly have no idea on what guarantees we have from the task
being current here as opposed to any other task -- I guess that another
thread calling exit for exemple would have to wait?
What about the possibility of sighand being null that the function does
check, is that impossible for current as well?


Honestly not a part of the code I'm much familiar with, this all
predates my involvement with 9p by a fair bit...

Anyway, not particularily fussy on this, it just looked like "the right
way" to lock a task signal handler among the few common patterns I could
see; I think it would make sense to just convert all such locks to a
single pattern for a maintenance pov but it's much more work than I'm
willing to do.
I'll just drop the patch :)

I definitely agree with this, hence my comment about an old patchset
that will remove these eventually, but while I did send the patches over
a year ago I never took them up due to lack of proper testing.
It's been something people regularily complained about that it makes the
task unkillable in a weird way and many tools like syzbot don't like it
(and potentially users who try ^C won't either)

I guess I'll try to find some time to finish that instead... Will be
more useful than trying to wrap my head around all of that :P


Thanks!
