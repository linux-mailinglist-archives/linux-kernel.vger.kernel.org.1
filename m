I read this thread expecting to explain the correct behaviour we
implement in Weston and how modesetting needs to be fixed, but ...
that seems OK to me? As long as `gbm_has_modifiers` is a proxy for 'we
used gbm_(bo|surface)_create_with_modifiers to allocate the buffer'.

Right, it doesn't ask, because userspace tells it which modifiers to
use. The correct behaviour is to take the list from the KMS
`IN_FORMATS` property and then pass that to
`gbm_(bo|surface)_create_with_modifiers`; GBM must then select from
that list and only that list. If that call does not succeed and Xorg
falls back to `gbm_surface_create`, then it must not call
`gbm_bo_get_modifier` - so that would be a modesetting bug. If that
call does succeed and `gbm_bo_get_modifier` subsequently reports a
modifier which was not in the list, that's a Mesa driver bug.

Two options for GBM users:
* call gbm_*_create_with_modifiers, it succeeds, call
gbm_bo_get_modifier, pass modifier into AddFB
* call gbm_*_create (without modifiers), it succeeds, do not call
gbm_bo_get_modifier, do not pass a modifier into AddFB

Anything else is a bug in the user. Note that falling back from 1 to 2
is fine: if `gbm_*_create_with_modifiers()` fails, you can fall back
to the non-modifier path, provided you don't later try to get a
modifier back out.

This would break other drivers.

I do think that they should also be reported to userspace if they are
accepted. Other users can and do look at the modifier list to see if
the buffer is acceptable for a given plane, so the consistency is good
here. Of course, in Mesa you would want to prioritise the new
modifiers over the legacy ones, and not allocate or return the legacy
ones unless that was all you were asked for. This would involve
tracking the used modifier explicitly through Mesa, rather than
throwing it away at alloc time and then later divining it from the
tiling mode.

Cheers,
Daniel
