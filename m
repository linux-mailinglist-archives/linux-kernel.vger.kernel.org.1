Hi Sudeep, [+Fuad, Andrew and Ard]

(To other interested readers: if you haven't seen it, the FF-A spec is here:
 https://static.docs.arm.com/den0077/a/DEN0077A_PSA_Firmware_Framework_Arm_v8-A_1.0_EAC.pdf
 since this discussion makes no sense without that, and a tiny bit of sense
 with it. It used to be called "SPCI" but it was recently renamed.)

Yes, I need to do the Big Rename at some point. Joy.

You also dropped most of the code, so this doesn't really do anything in
its current form ;)

I think it's useful to have a mode of operation where the hypervisor
allocates the RX/TX buffers and advertises them in the DT. However, we
can always add this later, so there's no need to have it in the binding
from the start. Best start as simple as possible, I reckon.

Setting the static RX/TX buffer allocation aside, why is a DT node needed
at all for the case where Linux is running purely as an FF-A client? I
thought everything should be discoverable via FFA_VERSION, FFA_FEATURES,
FFA_PARTITION_INFO_GET and FFA_ID_GET? That should mean we can get away
without a binding at all for the client case.

I think Ard has a case for something like this, where a VM actually consists
of multiple partitions so that S-EL0 services can be provided from NS-EL0.
However, he probably wants that for a dynamically created VM, so we'd
need a way to instantiate an FFA namespace for the VM. Maybe that can be
done entirely in userspace by the VMM...

I think we can start off with x0-x7 and extend if later if we need to.

I think that's the best you can do for now. We can probably help with
testing as our stuff gets off the ground.

No problem. Maybe it would help if I described roughly what we were thinking
of doing for KVM (this is open for discussion, of course):

 1. Describe KVM-managed partitions in the DT, along the lines of [1]
 2. Expose each partition as a file to userspace. E.g.:

    /dev/spci/:

	self
	e3a48fa5-dc54-4a8b-898b-bdc4dfeeb7b8
	49f65057-d002-4ae2-b4ee-d31c7940a13d

    Here, self would be a symlink to the host uuid. The host uuid file
    would implement FFA_MEM operations using an ioctl(), so you could,
    for example, share a user buffer with multiple partitions by issuing
    a MEM_SHARE ioctl() on self, passing the fds for the borrower partitions
    as arguments. Messaging would be implemented as ioctl()s on the
    partition uuid files themselves.

 3. We'll need some (all?) of these patches to unmap memory from the host
    when necessary:

    https://lwn.net/Articles/821215/

    (for nVHE, we'll have a stage-2 for the host so we can unmap there as
    well)

For communicating with partitions that are not managed by KVM (e.g. trusted
applications), it's not clear to me how much of that will be handled in
kernel or user. I think it would still be worth exposing the partitions as
files, but perhaps having them root only or just returning -EPERM for the
ioctl() if a kernel driver has claimed the partition as its own? Ideally,
FF-A would allow us to transition some of the Trusted OS interfacing code
out to userspace, but I don't know how realistic that is.

Anyway, to enable this, I think we need a clear separation in the kernel
between the FF-A code and the users: KVM will want to expose things as
above, but if drivers need to use this stuff as well then they can plug in
as additional users and we don't have to worry about tripping over the
RX/TX buffers etc.

What do you think, and do you reckon you can spin a cut-down driver that
implements the common part of the logic (since I know you've written much
of this code already)?

Cheers,

Will
