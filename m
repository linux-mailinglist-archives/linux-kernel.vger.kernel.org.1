I got some information from arch team today, to quote them exactly:

1) What benefits capacity based allocation brings over the default way
based allocation?

"Capacity based allows finer grain partition. It is not about improved
performance but more flexibility in configuration."

2) Retain through power collapse, doesnâ€™t it burn more power?

"This feature is similar to the standard feature of retention. Yes, when 
we
have cache in retention mode it burns more power but it keeps the values 
so
that when we wake up we can get more cache hits."


If its good enough, then I will add this info to the commit msg and post
next version.

Thanks,
Sai
