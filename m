Hi Mark, thank you for the comments.

May I know your suggestion on Ajye's patch "ASoC: qcom: sc7180: Modify
machine driver for 2mic" ?

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200928063744.525700-3-ajye_huang@compal.corp-partner.google.com

I think adding code in the machine driver makes the intent straightforward.
If we want the machine driver to be fully configurable,
we can always add more code to handle properties like gpio, route,
widget (mux, text selection) passed in from the device tree.
But I feel that we don't need a machine driver to be that configurable
from the device tree.
I think having the logic scattered in various dtsi files and relying
on manual inspection to understand the usage would be less
maintainable than only exposing needed property like gpio.
Especially in the complicated case where we need to create a mux
widget with callback toggling the gpio like this:

+static const char * const dmic_mux_text[] = {
+       "Front Mic",
+       "Rear Mic",
+};
+
+static SOC_ENUM_SINGLE_DECL(sc7180_dmic_enum,
+                           SND_SOC_NOPM, 0, dmic_mux_text);
+
+static const struct snd_kcontrol_new sc7180_dmic_mux_control =
+       SOC_DAPM_ENUM_EXT("DMIC Select Mux", sc7180_dmic_enum,
+                         dmic_get, dmic_set);
+
+SND_SOC_DAPM_MUX("Dmic Mux", SND_SOC_NOPM, 0, 0, &sc7180_dmic_mux_control),

Passing all the logic along with the callback of dmic_get, dmic_set
from the device tree would be too hard to maintain.

Yes, that should work to describe the dailink we are using.
But a more tricky issue is how to do calls like setting PLL in dai startup ops.

                /* Configure PLL1 for codec */
                ret = snd_soc_dai_set_pll(codec_dai, 0, RT5682_PLL1_S_MCLK,
                                          DEFAULT_MCLK_RATE, RT5682_PLL1_FREQ);

I think that asking a generic machine driver to do configuration like
this with only a limited interface of device property
might be too much of an ask for the machine driver.

Totally agree. Glad we have only three variations up to now.

Would you mind if I simplify the compatible string like Srinivas
suggested, and send a v12?

As for other two kinds of variations that I am aware of:

1. front mic / rear mic
2. replace alc5682 with adau7002

We can set different board names and different compatible strings to
achieve such variation.
So that it would make sense to describe configuration in compatible
strings like you suggested, and also provides UCM a way to distinguish
different boards.
What do you think ?

Thanks!
