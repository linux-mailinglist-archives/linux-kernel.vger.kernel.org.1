I'm not completely opposed to it but given that the setting is global,
I imagine it could have other consequences if two applications ran
at different times have different requirements. Given that it's OMP,
I would have imagined that an application that really cared about this
would specify what was needed using OMP_PLACES. Why would someone prefer
kernel tuning or a tuned profile over OMP_PLACES? After all, it requires
specific knowledge of the application even to know that a particular
tuned profile is needed.
