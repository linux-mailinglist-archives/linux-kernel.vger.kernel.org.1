You assume that a thermal zone only has cooling devices of a the same type (or
with the same fake unit for power consumption). This falls apart when multiple
types are used, which is common.

Also sustainable power is only a derived value, the lying already starts in
the energy model, which is used by EAS, so a fake unit could cause further
problems.

This is pretty much 'security' by obscurity. It would be relatively easy to
measure actual power consumption at different CPU speeds and derive the DPC
values from that.
