__vmx_vcpu_run() is roughly the scope, but that wont work.

Looking at the vmmon source:

Task_Switch()

    1) Mask all APIC LVTs which have NMI delivery mode enabled, e.g. PERF

    2) Disable interrupts

    3) Disable PEBS

    4) Disable PT

    5) Load a magic IDT

       According to comments these are stubs to catch any exception which
       happens while switching over.

    6) Write CR0 and CR4 directly which is "safe" as the the IDT is
       redirected to the monitor stubs.

    7) VMXON()

    8) Invoke monitor on some magic page which switches CR3 and GDT and
       clears CR4.PCIDE (at least thats what the comments claim)

       The monitor code is loaded from a binary only blob and that does
       the actual vmlaunch/vmresume ...

       And as this runs with a completely different CR3 sharing that
       code is impossible.

    When returning the above is undone in reverse order and any catched
    exceptions / interrupts are replayed via "int $NR".

So it's pretty much the same mess as with vbox just different and
binary. Oh well...

The "good" news is that it's not involved in any of the context tracking
stuff so RCU wont ever be affected when a vmware vCPU runs. It's not
pretty, but TBH I don't care.

Thanks,

        tglx
