In general no, but for MAINTAINERS changes it would. Let's say I add
an entry for Documentation/devicetree/foo-bar.txt. With a per
subsystem/path MAINTAINERS file in
Documentation/devicetree/MAINTAINERS, you'd add an entry there and run
get_maintainer.pl:

$ touch Documentation/devicetree/MAINTAINERS
$ scripts/get_maintainer.pl -f Documentation/devicetree/MAINTAINERS
Rob Herring <robh+dt@kernel.org> (maintainer:OPEN FIRMWARE AND
FLATTENED DEVICE TREE BINDINGS)
devicetree@vger.kernel.org (open list:OPEN FIRMWARE AND FLATTENED
DEVICE TREE BINDINGS)
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (open list)

Yes, I remember that. He didn't seem totally opposed to it which is why I asked.

I have another reason for wanting the split. I want to generate a
MAINTAINERS file from the DT schema files. We have the data there and
it's checked automatically. I don't care to either continually tell
folks to add a MAINTAINERS entry or tell them to run checkpatch.pl to
tell them that. But if the infrastructure got merged, would that
already work?
