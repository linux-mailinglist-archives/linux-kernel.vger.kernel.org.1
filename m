The idea was to account the events in the locked memory allocation too.
Not sure that made it into the patch though.

It has a minor issue that it might break some existing setups that rely
on the mmap fitting exactly into the mmap allocation, but that could
be solved by allowing a little slack, since the existing setups
likely don't have that many events.

There's also a secondary issue of DoS the kernel by creating very long
lists to iterate, but I suppose this is already quite possible, so probably
not a new issue.
