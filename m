If they did, my thought would be to add another early-exit check,
but under the tlimit check, so that pending non-RCU softirqs might
set a shorter time limit.  For example, instead of allowing up to the
current one second in rcu_do_batch(), allow only up to 100 milliseconds
or whatever.  But there are lots of choices, which is one reason to wait
until it becomes a problem.

That sounds like a most excellent idea, please do!
