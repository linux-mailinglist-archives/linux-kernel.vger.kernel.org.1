I hope so too, but external implementations tend to have staying power
once people starting using them.  You'd think e2fsdroid would have been
merged into mke2fs by now, but no...

<cough> even a single top level complaint still means it doesn't pass.

It wouldn't require a new flag -- "rocompat" features bits mean that
"it's safe to allow userspace to read files off the disk if software
doesn't recognize this feature bit".

We're (ab)using the "doesn't recognize" part of that sentence, since the
kernel doesn't recognize RO_COMPAT_READONLY (or SHARED_BLOCKS) when it
compares the superblock ro compat field to EXT4_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_SUPP.
It therefore only allows reading files.

If someone /did/ add the code to write to files safely in the presence
of shared blocks, all they'd have to do to light up the functionality is
add it to the _SUPP define.  Also, it's strange that the kernel source
doesn't even know of SHARED_BLOCKS, but that's also on Ted...
