You may try to use flash_erase/nandwrite/nanddump from the mtd-utils
package. You may first use a dummy functions and declare the entire
zone free (except for the bad block marker at the beginning).

Then, you may write the entire OOB area in regular mode then read it in
raw mode (-n). Sometimes the ECC bytes are not visible, in this case it
may be worth trying writing the OOB area with known data and read it
back and see what you get. But these information probably are in the
datasheet.

Good luck,
