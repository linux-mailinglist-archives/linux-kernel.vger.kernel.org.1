Good day and God bless you as you read this massage, I am by name
Tasha Laboso am 27 years old girl from Kenya, yes my Mother was Late
Mrs. Lorna Laboso the former Kenyan Assistant Minister of Home and
affairs who was among the plan that crash on board in the remote area
of Kalong=E2=80=99s westernKenya Read more about the crash with the below w=
eb
site

http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html

I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment I am
receiving from my step mother. She planned to take away all my late
mothers treasury and properties from me since the unexpected death of
my beloved mother. One day I opened my mother brave case and secretly
found out that my mother deposited the sum of $ 27.5 million in BOA
bank Burkina Faso with my name as the next of kin, then I visited
Burkina Faso to withdraw the money and take care of myself and start a
new life, on my arrival the Bank Director whom I meet in person Mr.
Batish Zongo told me that my mother left an instruction to the bank,
that the money should be release to me only when I am married or I
present a trustee who will help me and invest the money overseas.

That is the reason why I am in search of a honest and reliable person
who will help me and stand as my trustee for the Bank to transfer the
money to his account for me to come over and join you. It will be my
great pleasure to compensate you with 30% of the money for your help
and the balance shall be my capital with your kind idea for me to
invest under your control over there in your country.

As soon as I receive your positive response showing your interest I
will send you my picture's in my next mail and death certificate of my
Mon and how you will receive the money in your account.

Contact me though my Email: tashalaboso1919@gmail.com

Yours Sincerely
Tasha Laboso
