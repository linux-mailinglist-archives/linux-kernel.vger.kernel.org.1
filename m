It actually results in a _fully_ infinite loop.  That is: if anything
small causes a component of DRM to fail to probe then the whole system
doesn't boot because it just loops trying to probe over and over
again.  The messages I put in the commit message are printed over and
over and over again.

Great!  You can see in the earlier patch in the series that the very
first thing that happens when the parent device probes is that it
calls devm_of_platform_populate().  That means no dependencies, right?
 So that means it's fine/correct to add "simple-bus" here?

I'd say < 100 us.  I can try to quantify more if needed, but it wasn't
the point of this patch.

Ah, good idea!  I will try it.  However, even with devlinks, if there
is any chance of deferred probes then we need a fix like this.  The
point of the patch isn't about speeding things up but about avoiding
an infinite loop at bootup due to a small bug.

If you don't mind looking at the code patch, see:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200710160131.4.I358ea82de218ea5f4406572ade23f5e121297555@changeid/

Specifically you can see that each time we try to probe we were
calling of_platform_populate().  That appeared to be enough to trigger
things.
