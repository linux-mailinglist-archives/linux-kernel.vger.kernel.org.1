Definitely confusing and mostly because the dts stuff grew organically
for a while there.  It does feel like Rob is pretty clear on the
current state of things and the policy in the link I provided, though.

Right, you just have to accept the fact that logic doesn't come into
play here.  For clocks, always use "clk-names" but also always use a
consistent order (which is now more enforced by the schema checker).
For "reg" almost never use "reg-names".

If I had to guess Rob will say that we shouldn't add more places where
the convention is to have "-names".


I will put posting v4 of this patch on pause until this is resolved to
avoid fragmenting the discussion.
