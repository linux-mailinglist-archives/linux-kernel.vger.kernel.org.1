Thank you for the opinion.  But, my point here is, deprecating some terms would
occur in general as the f-word to hug replacement was, and the first patch is a
simple technical preparation for such case.  And, therefore, it would not need
to be blocked due to the second patch.

For example, as it seems at least you and I agree on the f-word to hug
replacement, we could add ``fuck||hug`` in the `deprecated_terms.txt` file to
avoid future spread of the f-words.

Also, I personally don't think the second patch as a political extreme change
but just a right thing to do.  Nonetheless, I also understand people could
think in different ways.  Moreover, it is obviously non-technical thing which I
am really bad at.

For the reason, I am CC-ing the code of conduct committees[1].  I would like to
hear their opinions on this.
