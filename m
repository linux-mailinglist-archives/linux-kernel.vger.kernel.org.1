> I had wondered why the bit is cleared, too. (I assumed it was OK or desir=
able, because it was being cleared in NMI context before). Happy to submit =
a separate patch to eliminate that issue as well, since the point of emerge=
ncy vmxoff is only to get out of VMX root mode - CR4.VMXE's state is irrele=
vant. Of course, clearing it prevents any future emergency vmxoff attempts.=
 (there seemed to be some confusion about "enabling" VMX vs. "in VMX operat=
ion" in the comments)  Should I?

I have a vague recollection of some firmwares that got upset if
rebooted with CR4.VMXE set.  Sean?

The real issue here is that the percpu CR4 machinery uses IRQ-offness
as a lock, and NMI breaks this.
