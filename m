Yeah, and then we decrease the compound mapcount, which is a counter of "how
many times is this compound page mapped as a whole". But we only removed (the
second) half of the compound mapping, so imho that would be wrong?

Kirill might correct me but I'd expect the THP code right now has baked in many
assumptions about THP pages being exactly HPAGE_PMD_ORDER large?
