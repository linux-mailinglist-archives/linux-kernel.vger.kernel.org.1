Earlier versions of kexec-tools had the in-purgatory checksum enabled unconditionally.
More recent versions let you disable it, I think the parameter is called no-checks. This
saves some time, but the relocations still have to be done.

For context, that is here:

I think we can maintain this approach, but it doesn't work for Pavel, as he has extra
requirements. I stopped looking at it because it became a solution no-one needed.

The 'eliminate relocations' comment goes with some of the context you removed.

The background to that is Pavel's timing requirements: Enabling the MMU isn't enough, from
his description he also depends on re-arranging the memory so the CPU only sees increasing
virtual addresses. This is what my 'write streaming' comment refers to.
Doing this requires rewriting the relocation assembly code.

If we enable the MMU during kexec relocation, I expect someone on a memory constrained
system to come out of the woodwork screaming 'regression'. Systems with insufficient
memory to allocate the page tables will no longer be able to kexec.

If we keep the relocation assembly code as it is, its possible for it to handle MMU-on and
MMU-off relocations with a very small adjustment. It just won't work for Pavel, as
enabling the MMU is not enough.

I'm confident we won't get a second copy of the relocation code, that only runs on some
platforms, past the arch code maintainer.

You're loading a 128M kernel!?

I'm happy to post the MMU-enabled series, it needs to be maintainable and solve someone's
problem.

To chip away at the rest of Pavel's problem, my suggestions were:
 * Allocate things in place. If we can allocate any 2MB hugepage, we can place the DTB
  there and not need to relocate it.

 * use huge pages more generally in the core code. With the MMU enabled, this might keep
   the core in write-streaming-mode for longer. (might, because this is very platform
   specific).

 * Store the kexec payload in the crashkernel carveout, to eliminate the relocations
   completely. This is the bit Pavel quoted.

To expand on the carveout:
The crashkernel carveout is sized to load the payload, and memory to run the kdump kernel
entirely from within the carveout. Its obviously bigger than the payload it contains.

If you load your kexec kernel into the 'memory' part of the carveout, it won't overwrite
the kdump payload, and it wont require relocation, as its already stored in place. arm64's
arch code will spot these in-place buffers, and skip the relocation.

If you kdump even after doing this, the kdump kernel sees the kexec payload as
uninitialised memory, and will overwrite it.

If we did this, we wouldn't need to enable the MMU, and it should skip most of the
relocation code on all architectures without any changes to the arch code.


On arm64 the kernel and initramfs only need relocating because their physical addresses
are baked into the DTB. The DTB's physical address is then passed to the new kernel.
From memory: 'relocatable kernel' is detectable from the image header, and the support
predates arm64's kexec support.
