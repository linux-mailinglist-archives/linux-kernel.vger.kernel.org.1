As a start, what about applying that logic specifically to out-of-tree modules? That would address the shim problem. The justification would be that in-tree modules have at least gone through some level of review on what they're exporting.

(Standard disclaimer: suggesting enhancements to the symbol licensing framework should not be taken as implicit endorsement of any legitimacy for non-GPL-compatible modules.)
