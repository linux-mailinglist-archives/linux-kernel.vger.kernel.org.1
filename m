Yes, makes sense. While this would suffice my needs at the moment it
really sounds like a dead end.

In my case there is no pci device visible before loading the firmware,
so creating a pci driver is not an option. Maybe pci host controllers
could register themselves as fpga-bridges. With this we could put the
pci host controller (or the pci device, AFAIK there is a PCI device tree
binding) where the fpga is connected into the fpga-bridges phandles list
of the fpga-region.
