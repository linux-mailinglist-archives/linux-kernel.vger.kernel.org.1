Thanks for writing this up. Should it go to Documentation/driver-api/, or
Documentation/driver-api/iommu/? I think this also needs to Cc
linux-doc@vger.kernel.org and corbet@lwn.net

Maybe drop the "New", to keep the documentation perennial. It might be
good to add internal links here to the specifications URLs at the bottom.

Identified either by an u64 or an mm_struct, right?  Maybe just drop the
second sentence if it's detailed in the IOASID set section below.

The intro isn't super clear. Perhaps this is simpler:
"Each IOASID set has a private namespace of SPIDs. An SPID maps to a
single system-wide IOASID."

These could be named "ioasid_set_alloc" and "ioasid_set_adjust" to be
consistent with the rest of the API.

Might be nicer to keep the same argument names within the API. Here "set"
rather than "sdata".

I don't follow this development. Having per-device PASID table would work
fine for isolation (assuming no hardware bug necessitating IOMMU groups).
If I remember correctly IOASID space was chosen to be OS-wide because it
simplifies the management code (single PASID per task), and it is
system-wide across VMs only in the case of VT-d scalable mode.

> +1. BIND/UNBIND
> +2. FREE

> +Rules:
> +
> +1. Multiple devices can bind with the same PASID, this can be different PCI
> +   devices or mdevs within the same PCI device. However, only the

> +2. IOASID code is responsible for ensuring the correctness of H-G

> +3. When UNBIND happens *after* FREE, KVM will see error in
> +   ioasid_get() even when the reclaim is not done. IOMMU driver will
