I agree that any randomness should be avoided.

My question is, do we need 15-digits?


The kernelrelease is formed by
[kernel version] + [some digits of git hash].


For example, "git describe" shows as follows:

v5.9.0-rc4-00034-g7fe10096c150


Linus gives a new tag every week (or every two week).


So, I think the conflict happens
only when we have two commits that start with the same 7-digits
in the _same_ release. Is this correct?

We have 14000 - 15000 commits in each release,
not 100M.
