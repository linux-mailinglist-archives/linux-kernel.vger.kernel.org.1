Hm when can this page be different from the "page" we got as function parameter?
I guess only if "object" was so close to the beginning of page that "object -
obj_offset(cachep)" underflowed it. So either "object" pointed to the
padding/redzone, or even below page->s_mem. Both situations sounds like we
should handle them differently than continuing with an unrelated page that's
below our slab page?

> +	objnr = obj_to_index(cachep, page, objp);

Related, this will return bogus value for objp below page->s_mem.
And if our "object" pointer pointed beyond last valid object, this will give us
too large index.


> +	objp = index_to_obj(cachep, page, objnr);

Too large index can cause dbg_userword to be beyond our page.
In SLUB version you have the WARN_ON_ONCE that catches such invalid pointers
(before first valid object or after last valid object) and skips getting the
backtrace for those, so analogical thing should probably be done here?

It would be safer to use objp0 instead of objp here I think. In case "object"
was pointer to the first object's left red zone, then we would not have "objp"
underflow "base" and get a bogus objnr. The WARN_ON_ONCE below could then be
less paranoid? Basically just the "objp >= base + page->objects * s->size"
should be possible if "object" points beyond the last valid object. But
otherwise we should get valid index and thus valid "objp = base + s->size *
objnr;" below, and "objp < base" and "(objp - base) % s->size)" should be
impossible?

Hmm but since it would then be possible to get a negative pointer offset (into
the left padding/redzone), kmem_dump_obj() should calculate and print it as signed?
But it's not obvious if a pointer to left red zone is a pointer that was an
overflow of object N-1 or underflow of object N, and which one to report (unless
it's the very first object). AFAICS your current code will report all as
overflows of object N-1, which is problematic with N=0 (as described above) so
changing it to report underflows of object N would make more sense?

Thanks,
Vlastimil
