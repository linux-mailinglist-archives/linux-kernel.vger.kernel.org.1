I simply don't have access to any other Atheros hardware.  Hopefully
others on this thread do, though?  ...but, if nothing else, I believe
code inspection shows that the only places that are affected by the
changes here are:

* Wifi devices that use "snoc.c".  The only compatible string listed
in "snoc.c" is wcn3990.

* Wifi devices that set "per_ce_irq" to true.  The only place in the
table where this is set to true is wcn3990.

While it is certainly possible that I messed up and somehow affected
other WiFi devices, the common bits of code in "ce.c" and "ce.h" are
fairly easy to validate so hopefully they look OK?
