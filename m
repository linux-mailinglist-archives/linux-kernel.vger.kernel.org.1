This should be part of the changelog. In general, any optimization
should come with some numbers showing the effect of the optimization.

As I've said I am not really familiar with pcp internals and how
efficiently it can organize smaller objects. Maybe it can really half
the memory consumption.

My only concern is that using smaller types for these counters can fire
back later on because we have an inderect dependency between the batch
size and the data type.  In general I do not really object to the patch
as long as savings are non trivial so that we are not creating a
potential trap for something that is practically miniscule
microptimization.
