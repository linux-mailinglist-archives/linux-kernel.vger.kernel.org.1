Why a whole new subdirectory for just one file?

Please keep it in the same directory until you get too many different
files.

Module name information?

Why not mhi_ as a prefix?  This is a very generic module name, right?

Why init this to -1?

I'm stopping right here.  A structure can only have ONE reference count
to control its lifespan.  You have 2 here, which guarantees that either
you are using a kref incorrectly, or your code is totally confused and
will break easily.

Please fix this as this is not how to do this.

Also, why does anyone need to care about the number of times that open()
is called?  The vfs layer should handle all of that for you, right?

No other misc driver has to deal with this multi-layered reference
counting, so perhaps you are making this a lot more complex than it
really has to be?

thanks,

greg k-h
