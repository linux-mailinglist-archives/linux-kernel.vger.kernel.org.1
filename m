Yes, I will add the two papers I referenced, although it isn't a very
thorough list of references (ok, not even close to thorough).

No - I cut out only code blocks from scripts/kallsyms.c, but there was
no neat way to reuse entire functions without majorly refactoring a lot
of stuff in scripts/kallsyms.c

The problem with putting this in utils.c was because there was an
inline function (static) that I use that is defined in extable.c
(ex_to_insn). If I move this to utils.c I'm not sure how to keep re-
using this inline function without modifying it with a define like
STATIC. I thought it was cleaner to just leave it alone and do it this
way.

I don't include .text in the sections[] array because sections[] is
only for sections to be randomized, and we don't randomize .text.

You are right, I could have put a continue here and saved the next
compare.

This change was made to fix the issue of having malloc_ptr be declared
locally rather than globally - (that weird problem I was having that
made it so I had to #include all the .c files until I figured out what
the issue was. If I separate out the change, then I feel like the
commit doesn't make sense out of this context. What if I put a big
comment in misc.h?

I can delete it - it's not "needed", but was done to show an
intentional discard of the return value from adjust_address.


The rest of your feedback incorporated into v3.
