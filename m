Well only a biased one, obviously: polling causes large amounts of busy
waiting, which is a waste of CPU resources and does increase the time
it takes us to do TPM operations ... not a concern if you're doing long
computation ones, like signatures, but it is a problem for short
operations like bulk updates of PCRs.  The other potential issue, as we
saw with atmel is that if you prod the chip too often (which you have
to do with polling) you risk upsetting it.  We've spent ages trying to
tune the polling parameters to balance reduction of busy wait with chip
upset and still, apparently, not quite got it right.  If the TPM has a
functioning IRQ then it gets us out of the whole polling mess entirely.
The big question is how many chips that report an IRQ actually have a
malfunctioning one?
