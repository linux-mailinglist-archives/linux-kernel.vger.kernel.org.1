Please note that memory onlining is *completely* controllable by user
space. User space can offline/online memory blocks as it wants. Not
saying this might actually be the right thing to do - but we cannot
trust that user space does the right thing.

So at any point in time, you have to assume that

a) added memory might not get onlined
b) previously onlined memory might get offlined
c) previously offline memory might get onlined

Assume we added a partially plugged memory block, which is now offline.
Further assume user space did not online the memory block (e.g., no udev
rules).

User space could happily online the block after unloading the driver.
Again, we have to assume user space could do crazy things.

Yes, but the guest could online the memory and make use of it.

(again, whoever decides to unload the driver better be knowing what he does)

To do it even more cleanly, we would

a) Have to remove completely plugged offline blocks (not done)
b) Have to remove partially plugged offline blocks (done)
c) Actually send unplug requests to the hypervisor

Right now, only b) is done, because it might actually cause harm (as
discussed). However, the problem is, that c) might actually fail.

Long short: we could add a) if it turns out to be a real issue. But
than, unloading the driver isn't really suggested, the current
implementation just "keeps it working without crashes" - and I guess
that's good enough for now.

Sorry, I should have given you the right pointer. (similar to my other
reply)

We hold a reference either via

1. alloc_contig_range()
2. memmap init code, when not calling generic_online_page().

So these fake-offline pages can never be actually offlined, because we
no longer have the memory notifier registered to fix that up.
