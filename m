Mark had mentioned about it earlier (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11287805/)
Did I misinterpret the first part ? Could not figure "capping the emulated debug
features" part. Probably, Mark could give some more details.

From the earlier discussion:

* ID_DFR0 fields need more thought; we should limit what we expose here.
  I don't think it's valid for us to expose TraceFilt, and I suspect we
  need to add capping for debug features we currently emulate.
