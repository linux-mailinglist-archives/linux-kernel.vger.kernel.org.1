The problem with nommu and non-coherent dma is the dma_alloc_coherent
calls.  Most platforms with an mmu set a nocache bit through the page
tables (including sh), but that option obviously doesn't exist for
nommu.  Some hardware has an uncached window where access is uncached
automatically if access through specific kernel virtual addresses,
for that the architecture needs to impement the arch_dma_set_uncached
helper and select CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_DMA_SET_UNCACHED.  If that also
doesn't exist you'll need some sort of pool of always uncached
memory (set by the firmware or early startup code).  That currently
doesn't exist in generic code, but we have a bunch of architectures
implementing that in arch_dma_alloc.  I plan to have a common
implementation of the pool soon hopefully.

Streaming DMA just works if you reuse the existing
arch_sync_dma_for_device implementation.
