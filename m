This combination (DesignWare HDMI controller + I2S) is same as on Rockchip. 
Only difference is slightly different version of HDMI controller and different 
I2S core. Not sure what kind of configuration do you have in mind, but all 
these controllers support 2-8 channels, different sample sizes, even 
passthrough mode can be set (but it's not implemented yet). I would say that 
this audio output supports quiet a few possible configurations.

BTW, above patches were thoroughly tested in LibreELEC. The only missing thing 
is extending I2S driver to support channel allocation through DT, but that's 
outside the scope of this series. Currently only 2 channels will work 
correctly.

Best regards,
Jernej
