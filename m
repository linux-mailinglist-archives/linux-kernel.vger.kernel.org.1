Subject: [PATCH v4 00/21] Move Hisilicon 6421v600 SPMI driver set out of staging

Hi Mark/Lee,

This patch series finish addressing support for Hikey 970
SPMI controller, PMIC and regulators.

I removed some unrelated DT patches from this series,
plus the Hikey 970 PHY USB3 code from it, in order to avoid
mixing different stuff on this series[1].

[1] Those unrelated patches were submitted last week on
separate series.

The entire patchset is on this branch:

	https://git.linuxtv.org/mchehab/experimental.git/log/?h=hikey970-destage-usb

In order to make easier for review, this series was generated
with --no-renames. So, you don't need to take a look at the
staging patches, as the entire code will be there on patches 9-11.

The last two patches on this series will likely require that other
patch series to get merged first. It probably makes sense to be
merged via DT tree. 

Regards,
Mauro

v4:
- use regmap for mfd and spmi drivers;
- a few minor cleanups at the mfd driver.

v3:
- fixed a bug with eco-mode at get_optimum_mode;
- changed the sleep logic when enabling/disabling a power line;
- additional cleanups, as requested by Mark.

v2:

- this driver's probe routine is very similar to the one at the non-SPMI
  variant of Hisilicon 6421;
- The register/voltage data were moved from DT into the driver itself;
- It doesn't have anymore any static data;
- All debug messages got removed;
- Addressed a few be32 warnings from sparse.
