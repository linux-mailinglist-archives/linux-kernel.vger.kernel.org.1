I don't think you can use __sched_clock_offset without selecting
HAVE_UNSTABLE_SCHED_CLOCK, and we really don't want to do that just
for this. So Peter's idea about exposing what we need is better, although
you'll probably need to take care with the switch-over from jiffies.

It needs some thought, but one possibility would be to introduce a new
variant of sthe ched_clock_register() function that returns the cycle
offset, and then we could fish that out of the timer driver. If we're
crossing all the 'i's and dotting all the 't's then we'd want to disable the
perf userpage if sched_clock changes clocksource too (a bit like we do for
the vDSO).
