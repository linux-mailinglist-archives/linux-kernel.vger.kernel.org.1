What do you mean by "propriety" driver vs. "generic" driver?

Shouldn't there be some "generic" way that UEFI tells any driver where
these memory locations are that can not be used as general memory?  If
not, try fixing up UEFI for that.

CMA needs to be told where to reserve the memory at boot time.  If you
want to use that, great, but something has to tell it, so perhaps just
get that info from UEFI as that is the "equilivant" to a device tree,
right?

Try it all out and see, all of this is pointless without real patches,
which is why we almost never have these kinds of discussions without
working code.
