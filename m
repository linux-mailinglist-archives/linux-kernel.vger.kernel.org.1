Subject: [PATCH v1 18/25] timekeeping: Use sequence counter with associated raw spinlock

A sequence counter write side critical section must be protected by some
form of locking to serialize writers. A plain seqcount_t does not
contain the information of which lock must be held when entering a write
side critical section.

Use the new seqcount_raw_spinlock_t data type, which allows to associate
a raw spinlock with the sequence counter. This enables lockdep to verify
that the raw spinlock used for writer serialization is held when the
write side critical section is entered.

If lockdep is disabled this lock association is compiled out and has
neither storage size nor runtime overhead.
