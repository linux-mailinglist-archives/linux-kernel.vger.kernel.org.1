Wouldn't it be better to rearrange this code to only run if the devices
are present? This is a macio driver on pmac and a platform driver on mac,
so shouldn't it be possible to only run this code when the appropriate
entries are present in the right data structures?

I didn't look at a lot of the other serial drivers, but some other mac
drivers have recently been updated to no longer have MACH_IS_MAC checks
due to being converted to platform drivers.
