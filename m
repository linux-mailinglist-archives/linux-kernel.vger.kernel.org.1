Reviewed-by: Stephen Boyd <sboyd@kernel.org>

Although I don't think ktime_get() inside of readl_poll_timeout_atomic()
is correct. The timekeeping base won't be able to update when a loop is
spinning in an irq disabled region. We need the tick interrupt to come
in and update the base. Spinning for a second with irqs disabled is also
insane for realtime so there's that problem too. Maybe we should try to
kick timekeeping forward from these loops manually. Anyway, not problems
with this patch so not important to fix immediately.
