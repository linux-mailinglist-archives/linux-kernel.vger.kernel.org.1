Subject: How to Evade National Service and Reservist (Conscription) in 
Singapore with Guaranteed Success

This is an advice/suggestion to all Singaporean males who are below the 
age of 18 years old (how to malinger).

If you tell people in the Singapore-based Hardwarezone 
Eat-Drink-Man-Woman (EDMW) forums that you are a Targeted Individual, 
trillions of pro-PAP government supporters and secret government agents 
there will tell you that you have a mental illness, for sure.

A Targeted Individual is a person who is persecuted, targeted and marked 
by the government.

A Targeted Individual is a person who is persecuted, targeted and marked 
by the government.

If you make an appointment and tell a psychiatrist in Singapore that you 
are a Targeted Individual, you will definitely be diagnosed with a 
mental illness.

This is how I have managed to evade reservist duties for the past 19 
years since 2001 until today 10 April 2020 Good Friday (malingering).

Try it! You will never have to serve National Service and Reservist for 
the whole of your lives. Guaranteed.
