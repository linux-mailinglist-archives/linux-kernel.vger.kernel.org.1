"user memory allocation", I assume?  Or maybe "blockable memory
allocatoins".

Well, what's really going on here?

Is networking potentially consuming an unbounded amount of memory?  If
so, then killing a process will just cause networking to consume more
memory then hit against the same thing.  So presumably the answer is
"no, the watermarks are inappropriately set for this workload".

So would it not be sensible to dynamically adjust the watermarks in
response to this condition?  Maintain a larger pool of memory for these
allocations?  Or possibly push back on networking and tell it to reduce
its queue sizes?  So that stuff doesn't keep on getting oom-killed?
