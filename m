Sphinx doesn't like multi-line literal blocks with ``foobar``:

    Documentation/watch_queue.rst:109: WARNING: Inline literal start-string without end-string.
    Documentation/watch_queue.rst:109: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
    Documentation/watch_queue.rst:109: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
    Documentation/watch_queue.rst:109: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
    Documentation/watch_queue.rst:186: WARNING: Inline literal start-string without end-string.
    Documentation/watch_queue.rst:186: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
    Documentation/watch_queue.rst:185: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

So, let's use the "::" markup instead.

While we could do the fix only at the affected lines, let's
do the same change along the entire file, in order to preserve
the same look and feel at the entire doc.
