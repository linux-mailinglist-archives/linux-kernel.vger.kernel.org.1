OK, thanks for all the context.  Was a fun read ;)

SO let's run with splitting into 2 flags.  Ignat would you be up to
tweaking your patch to provide that and post a v2?

An added bonus would be to consolidate your 0/1 and 1/1 patch headers,
and add in the additional answers you provided in this thread to help
others understand the patch (mainly some more detail about why tasklet
is used).

Thanks,
Mike
