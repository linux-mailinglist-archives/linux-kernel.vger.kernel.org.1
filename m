Subject: [PATCH] mm/cma.c: use exact_nid true to fix possible per-numa cma leak

Calling cma_declare_contiguous_nid() with false exact_nid for per-numa
reservation can easily cause cma leak and various confusion.
For example, mm/hugetlb.c is trying to reserve per-numa cma for gigantic
pages. But it can easily leak cma and make users confused when system has
memoryless nodes.

In case the system has 4 numa nodes, and only numa node0 has memory.
if we set hugetlb_cma=4G in bootargs, mm/hugetlb.c will get 4 cma areas
for 4 different numa nodes. since exact_nid=false in current code, all
4 numa nodes will get cma successfully from node0, but hugetlb_cma[1 to 3]
will never be available to hugepage will only allocate memory from
hugetlb_cma[0].

In case the system has 4 numa nodes, both numa node0&2 has memory, other
nodes have no memory.
if we set hugetlb_cma=4G in bootargs, mm/hugetlb.c will get 4 cma areas
for 4 different numa nodes. since exact_nid=false in current code, all
4 numa nodes will get cma successfully from node0 or 2, but hugetlb_cma[1]
and [3] will never be available to hugepage as mm/hugetlb.c will only
allocate memory from hugetlb_cma[0] and hugetlb_cma[2].
This causes permanent leak of the cma areas which are supposed to be
used by memoryless node.

Of cource we can workaround the issue by letting mm/hugetlb.c scan all
cma areas in alloc_gigantic_page() even node_mask includes node0 only.
that means when node_mask includes node0 only, we can get page from
hugetlb_cma[1] to hugetlb_cma[3]. But this will cause kernel crash in
free_gigantic_page() while it wants to free page by:
cma_release(hugetlb_cma[page_to_nid(page)], page, 1 << order)

On the other hand, exact_nid=false won't consider numa distance, it
might be not that useful to leverage cma areas on remote nodes.
I feel it is much simpler to make exact_nid true to make everything
clear. After that, memoryless nodes won't be able to reserve per-numa
CMA from other nodes which have memory.
