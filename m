That's what we do also right now. It works reasonably well, the only
two pain points are/have been the reaction time under quick workload
expansion and inadvertently forcing the workload into direct reclaim.

Interesting, may I ask how the file cache is managed in this setup?

Right, essentially the same parameters that psi poll() would take.
