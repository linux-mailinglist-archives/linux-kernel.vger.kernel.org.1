It is actually already defined and present in internal.h as enum 
mhi_ch_state.

The old set of enums has MHI_CH_STATE_STOP from enum mhi_ch_state and 
the new
enum I introduced is MHI_CH_STATE_TYPE_STOP from enum enum 
mhi_ch_state_type.

If it seems confusing, suggestions to renaming them are welcome.

I included this change here because, a channel can be in "stopped" state 
and
a user module could be unloaded or a crash could force a driver remove 
leading
us to come this check.

If you think I should move it as a separate patch, let me know.
