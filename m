Sorry if my answer made you confused.  What I wanted to say was that the
fundamental access checking mechanism that DAMON depends on is PTE Accessed bit
for now, but it could be modified to use PMU or other features instead.  In
other words, PMU on some architectures could provide the fundamental, low level
information for DAMON, as PTE Accessed bit does.  What DAMON does are efficient
control of the fundamental access checking features and making of elaborated
final informations, which PMU itself doesn't provide.


Thanks,
