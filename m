The way it works is it pushes all commits into unbound work queue, but
then forces serialization as needed. We do _not_ want e.g. updates on
different CRTC to be serialized, that would result in lots of judder.
And hw is funny enough that there's all kinds of dependencies.

The way you force synchronization is by adding other CRTC state
objects. So if DC is busted and can only handle a single update per
work item, then I guess you always need all CRTC states and everything
will be run in order. But that also totally kills modern multi-screen
compositors. Xorg isn't modern, just in case that's not clear :-)

Lucking at the code it seems like you indeed have only a single dm
state, so yeah global sync is what you'll need as immediate fix, and
then maybe fix up DM to not be quite so silly ... or at least only do
the dm state stuff when really needed.

We could also sprinkle the drm_crtc_commit structure around a bit
(it's the glue that provides the synchronization across commits), but
since your dm state is global just grabbing all crtc states
unconditionally as part of that is probably best.

Yeah something is wrong here, and the fix looks horrible :-)

Aside, I've also seen some recent discussion flare up about
drm_atomic_state_get/put used to paper over some other use-after-free,
but this time related to interrupt handlers. Maybe a few rules about
that:
- dont
- especially not when it's interrupt handlers, because you can't call
drm_atomic_state_put from interrupt handlers.

Instead have an spin_lock_irq to protect the shared date with your
interrupt handler, and _copy_ the date over. This is e.g. what
drm_crtc_arm_vblank_event does.
