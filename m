Coming back to the v2 discussion on this patch

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200311181601.18314-10-valentin.schneider@arm.com

SD_BALANCE_WAKE is not used in mainline anymore, so wakeups are always
fast today.

I.e. you wouldn't need a per_cpu(sd_balance_wake, cpu) since it's always
NULL.

I.e. want_affine logic and the 'for_each_domain(cpu, tmp)' isn't needed
anymore.

This will dramatically simplify the code in select_task_rq_fair().

But I guess Vincent wants to keep the functionality so we're able to
enable SD_BALANCE_WAKE on certain sd's?
