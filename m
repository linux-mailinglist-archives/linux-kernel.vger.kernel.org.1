I will attend and it would surely be interesting to me and other
s390 folks. Your efforts are greatly appreciated!

BTW I believe basic Clang support for s390 came earlier in 5.2 with
a lot of efforts from Arnd Bergmann.

My part was fixing recent breakages and bugging our s390 clang team
(which did all the great work) to get kernel specific features support
in clang 10 and 11 to reach features parity with gcc. And eventually
doing few adjustments so that features which came with clang 10 and
11 are working smoothly. That is s390 "asm goto" support and specific
compiler flags for ftrace support and stack packing.
