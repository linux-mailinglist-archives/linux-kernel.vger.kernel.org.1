Made you more sad because you don't have a working solution for upstream
or RHEL 8.4?

I may have missed it in your past emails but how were you able to
provide blk-snap support for kernels prior to 5.8?

I don't see any mail from you on Dec 7... please bounce it to me if it
was in private, or please point to the relevant list archive.

My primary concern is that blk_interposer be correct from the start.  To
validate its correctness it needs to be fully implemented and vetted in
terms on upstream Linux kernel code.  DM can easily serve as the primary
upstream consumer until if/when your blk-snap module is proposed for
upstream inclusion.

But short of having an actual upstream consumer of blk_interposer (not
just samples/ code) it cannot go upstream.  Otherwise there are too many
risks of misuse and problems in the longrun.  That and it'd be baggage
block core would need to carry for no upstream Linux benefit.
