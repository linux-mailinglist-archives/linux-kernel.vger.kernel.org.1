I'm seeing a very small number of DTs using it, the majority of which
are pretty old - the arm64 ones are just mistakes on the part of
reviewers.

This seems like a massive jump.  You appear to be saying that the reg
property is unusable which doesn't seem right to me?

I can't tell from this description what this change is intended to do,
and I suspect it'd be difficult for anyone trying to figure out if they
should use this or not.  What is a full name and what should people put
in there?  What would one look like for example?  I have to look at the
code to see that this is changing to compare against the full_name field
in the node and there's no kerneldoc for struct device_node.

I'm also wondering why we can't just add this to the list of fallbacks
rather than requiring some custom per driver thing?

Please write normal conditional statements for the benefits of people
who have to read this code, the extra ! in there isn't adding anything
here either.
