(There's a question about a function that you maintain below, the context is
that cpumask_any() now truly returns a random cpu in the mask and there were
concern it might break something you maintain)

The API has always been clear that cpumask_any return a random cpu within the
mask. And the fact it's a one liner with cpumask_first() directly visible,
a user made the choice to stick to cpumask_any() indicates that that's what
they wanted.

Probably a lot of them they don't care what cpu is returned and happy with the
random value. I don't see why it has to have an effect. Some could benefit,
like my use case here. Or others truly don't care, then it's fine to return
anything, as requested.

I CCed Rafael who's the maintainer of this file who can speak better of what
should be expected.

I don't see why it _should_ be cpumask_first(). AFAICT any cpu can be the new
leader. So nothing breaks here.

I CCed Marc who's the maintainer of this file who can clarify better if this
really breaks anything.

If any interrupt expects to be affined to a specific CPU then this must be
described in DT/driver. I think the GIC controller is free to distribute them
to any cpu otherwise if !force. Which is usually done by irq_balancer anyway
in userspace, IIUC.

I don't see how cpumask_any_and() break anything here too. I actually think it
improves on things by better distribute the irqs on the system by default.

Marc will know better for sure. It's been a long time I looked at irqchip code.

> - ... and there might be more

I can appreciate you have some concerns this might break something. But IMO
this will be isolated cases of bad copy/paste. I think the blanket conversion
of cpumask_any() to cpumask_first() is the bad one because it dishonours the
choice developers made to pick one over the other. As I mention above the doc
was clear it will return a random value and the oneliner gave a clear
alternative to the user if they missed the cpumask_first() API.

The name of the API is so descriptive anyway to think that most users got it
wrong. And I think it acts as a good natural documentation of the code.

This is speculation. Unless we ask every developer we can't tell. Given the
clear documentation of cpumask_any() returns a random value, the natural
conclusion is that people want that or just truly don't care.

I strongly disagree with this. I'd rather keep the status-quo instead and just
use the new function in rt.c as it's currently named.

It's hard to judge. As the API clearly says this returns a random value,
I think assuming that most users got it wrong is the unnatural way of
thinking. If there happened to be bad users, that's an isolated cases and bugs
that we can certainly be easily fixed.

Thanks
