If a sanitizer comes to question this change, I don't see how a
READ_ONCE() anywhere near here (on info->flags?) is likely to be
enough to satisfy it - it would be asking for a locking scheme that
it understands (being unable to read the comment) - and might then
ask for that same locking in the numerous other places that read
info->flags (and a few that write it).  Add data_race()s all over?

(Or are you concerned about that inode->i_size, which I suppose ought
really to be i_size_read(inode) on some 32-bit configurations; though
that's of very long standing, and has never caused any concern before.)

I am not at all willing to add annotations speculatively, in case this
or that tool turns out to want help later.  So far I've not heard of
any such complaint on 5.7-rc[3456] or linux-next: but maybe this is
too soon to hear a complaint, and you feel this should not be rushed
into -stable?

This was an AUTOSEL selection, to which I have no objection, but it
isn't something we were desperate to push into -stable: so I've also
no objection if Greg shares your concern, and prefers to withdraw it.
(That choice may depend on to what extent he expects to be keeping
-stable clean against upcoming sanitizers in future.)

Hugh
