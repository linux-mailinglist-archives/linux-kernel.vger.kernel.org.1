Unless I am missing something, deployment/maintenance story for this
for syzbot, syzkaller users, other kernel testing, reproducer
extraction, bisection, resproducer hermeticity is quite complicated. I
don't see it outweighing any potential benefit in reporting quality.

I also don't see how it will improve reproducer/bisection quality: to
confirm presence of a bug we still need to trigger all cycle edges
within a single run anyway, it does not have to be a single VM, but
still needs to be a single test case. And this "having all edges
within a single test case" seems to be the root problem. I don't see
how this proposal addresses this problem.
