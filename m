Right, individual end-to-end latencies are very important for the

Agree with you that the naming is not good.

If we don't make any kernel modifications, it is not easy to get
whehter the psi_memstall_{enter, leave} is nested or not.
The nested psi_memstall_{enter, leave} may make some noises.
Seems the first option is better. With _RET_IP_ we can also get the caller.
So how about adding tracepoints for psi_memstall_{enter, leave} as bellow ?
