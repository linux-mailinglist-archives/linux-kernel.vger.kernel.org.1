Understand completely.  The change is in a way mechanic, that is we
have the following sequence:

1 execve starts
     |
     |    access args, may fault, deadlock in user mode fault handler
     |    de_thread, may block waiting for strace to call wait and so
     |
     |    exec_mm_release, may also falut, deadlock un user mode fault handler
     v
2 process update begins
     |
     |    should not block, to our current knowledge (except when loading a nfs image probably ?)
     |    credentials may change at any time.
     |
     v
3 process update done
     |
     v
4 execve done


So we have functions that access the process memory map. they use the credentials
and need to access the correct image, not to reveal secrets of the new about to be
loaded image.  they need the inner mutex from 2 .. 3

Also when you want to read credentials of another thread, it is probably better
to have a consistent state of the credentials, and no new privs for instance.
That also needs the inner mutex from 2 .. 3

And then we have things that change the credentials or no new privs, in general
all ptrace_attach and security modules are of that kind.  They need the
mutex from 1 .. 4, but I want to change the name, in the two patches below, and
I want to break the dead-lock from ptrace in a API-incompatible way, but in a
very limited breaking change, that only breaks what is already broken.


There are two more patches, which might be of interest for you, just to
make the picture complete.
It is not clear if we go that way, or if Eric has a yet better idea.

[PATCH v7 15/16] exec: Fix dead-lock in de_thread with ptrace_attach
https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg3459067.html

[PATCH v6 16/16] doc: Update documentation of ->exec_*_mutex
https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg3449539.html



Thanks
Bernd.
