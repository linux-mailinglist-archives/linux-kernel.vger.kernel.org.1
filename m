During the session, I introduced the list of future works and asked the
audiences to vote for the priority of the tasks:
https://youtu.be/jOBkKMA0uF0?t=13253

To summarize here, the tasks are (highest priority first):

1. Make current DAMON patchset series merged in the mainline (6 votes)
2. User space interface improvement (4 votes)
 - Multiple monitoring contexts
 - Charging of the monitoring threads' CPU usage
3. Support more address spaces (2 votes)
 - Cgroups, cached pages, specific file-backed pages, swap slots, ...
3. DAMON-based MM optimizations (2 votes)
 - Page reclaim, THP, compaction, NUMA balancing, ...
4. Optimize for special use-cases (1 vote)
 - Page granularity monitoring, accessed-or-not monitoring, ...

So, I'd like to focus on polishing current patchset so that it could be merged
in.  For that, I'd like to ask your more reviews.

While waiting for the reviews, I will start implementing other future features
that received many votes.  The support of multiple monitoring contexts for the
user space would be the first one.  Once the implementation is finished, I will
post it as separated RFC patchset (the user space interface will be compatible
with current one).

Any comment is welcome.


Thanks,
SeongJae Park
