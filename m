Well thank you very much. Thanks to this I was able to test my sparc
patches in qemu. :)

Oh I didn't find these images when searching for them. They would be
super helpful but there's no qemu for ia64 anymore that's useable. I had
tried building qemu from an old source based on a gsoc project for an
ia64 port but that turned out to be more involved than writing ia64
assembly itself. :)

Oh that's pretty neat. Thanks!
