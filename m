Then let's hope that next time someone will read this documentation
before submitting such report to @security.

All of our documentation is our wish that someone will read it and
follow it. Just because people might not follow it, is not necessarily a
reason to skip documentation.

I understand. That's why I also mentioned the criteria of exploitable
and posing a security risk. First case (even stricter - publicly
exploitable) is already mentioned in submitting-patches so I am not
changing the current status.

I merely want to document it based on recent discussion.

Indeed, I will update the maintainers as well.
