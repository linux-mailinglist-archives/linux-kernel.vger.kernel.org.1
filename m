Sad you can't use the in-kernel code for this, I really don't understand
what's wrong with using it as-is.

Daniel, why do we need/want duplicate code floating around in the tree
like this?

Copying code leads to errors, here's some documentation ones:

Is that what this still does?

"The hl_dma_fence" module...

And is it a stand-alone module?  Or just a single file?

Why is dma-buf only for use for DRM?

If it is, should the symbol namespace be set to that to catch users that
want to use it for their own code?

I don't think this is correct anymore, right?  :(

Same comments here for the .h file.
