TCS cmd->wait, will be set by the callers of rpmh APIs. We don't set in 
our driver.

Thanks for pointing this, yes both of these places it can be removed.

tcs cmd->wait will be set by callers of rpmh API.

>
> ...or are you expecting rpmh_write_batch() to take advantage of this somehow?

Yes.

Lets me take an example,

a caller is sending below data in rpmh_write_batch()

CMD0: addr=a, data=x, wait=0,
CMD1: addr=b, data=y, wait=1,
CMD2: addr=c, data=z, wait=0,

now __tcs_buffer_write()  with current code is setting two things,

1. serialize sending the commands (by setting RSC_DRV_CMD_WAIT_FOR_CMPL 
for CMD1)
This ensured that CMD1 is waited to complete before triggering any new 
command (CMD2 of TCS) to the HW.

2. wait for completion of commands before returning (by setting 
CMD_MSGID_RESP_REQ for CMD1)
This ensured that CMD1 is complete before generating completion interrupt.

This patch drops serialization part (1), so that all the commands can be 
triggered at once and can parallelly be finished.
if wait=1 is set for some command, the completion interrupt will be 
generated once those commands are complete in HW.
