There should only be a single copy, which could either be in the kernel
(if there's Rust code compiled into the kernel) or be in a "rust.ko"
support module. As long as you use the same version of Rust for the
kernel and all modules, you can supply symbols dynamically.

There are a few other steps we can take to control code size, as well.
In particular, there are tradeoffs between performance and size, such as
the amount of code in generics vs non-generics. (We also need to get
some further optimizations into Rust on that front, such as tail
merging.)

As for the size overall, given that we'll just be providing the portions
of "core" and "alloc" that the built code actually uses, and likely not
providing "std" at all, I would expect the size to remain relatively
small.

I very much care about overall kernel size, and I'm happy to help make
sure it remains reasonable.

There are libraries like intrusive-collections which implement
kernel-style structures with potentially multiple nodes in the structure
that put them into multiple lists at once. I would expect us to use
those (or in some cases implement our own). They don't need to be
written in C, just unsafe Rust that's wrapped up in a safe interface.

Just as the kernel has a variety of higher-level interfaces and data
structures that make working in the kernel sometimes *easier* than the
average C program, I'd expect that we'll end up with common Rust
structures that do what people need, rather than people reimplementing
their own.
