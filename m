I just noticed that locking in regulator_resolve_coupling() is bogus.
This all holds up because regulator_list_mutex is held during the call.
Feel free to test a patch below.

I'm working my way to push allocations outside of the locks, but the
coupling-related locking will need to be fixed regardless.

[PATCH] regulator: remove superfluous lock in regulator_resolve_coupling()

The code modifies rdev, but locks c_rdev instead. The bug remains:
stored c_rdev could be freed just after unlock anyway. This doesn't blow
up because regulator_list_mutex taken outside holds it together.
