Yeah, it's just getting more deeper into the rabbit hole.

I'm fine with adding it to the tracing code (with that ridiculous
comment! ;-)

I'll even tag is as stable, but again, it's uncertain what commit that it
"fixes".

Just because tracing get's a workaround, let's hopefully not get distracted
and forgot to add this. It looks like the best solution is to not need the
vmalloc_sync_mappings() call in the future. But, as we are about to release
trace-cmd with a feature that reliably triggers the bug, I can't wait for
the proper fix.
