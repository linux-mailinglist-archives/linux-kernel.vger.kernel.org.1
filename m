OK, that would be best since it's your patch.  We've got 12 days left
to get the free returns policy, so if you haven't managed to find one
by the end of next week, I'll order one and play with it ... you could
always put your manager's credit card down for one as well ...
especially as it should get refunded ...

Absolutely ... we can't turn interrupts on and then have a load of hung
laptops we already knew about ...
