Well this is access via sysfs causing a holdoff. Another way of access to
the same information without adding atomics and counters would be best.

They are still where they have been for the last decade or so. In my git
tree on kernel.org. They were also reworked a couple of times and posted
to linux-mm. There are historical posts going back over the years where
individuals have modified them and used them to create multiple other
tests.
