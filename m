We can treat this as a key for now. This gets rid of the unnecessary log messages.

When adecision is made about how to handle extended events it will be very easy
just to make this its own case statement and handle with it separately.

However if you want to pass Fn lock event to userspace there are keys from older
models of type 0010:
    /* Fn-lock switched to function keys */
    { KE_IGNORE, 0x0, { KEY_RESERVED } },

    /* Fn-lock switched to multimedia keys */
    { KE_IGNORE, 0x1, { KEY_RESERVED } },

They should also be changed to be passed to userspace and they don't signify status
with extended data rather by which event is called.

This means that passing these types of events to userspace is a separate task, that
might require rethinking the entire design of how all event types are treated.

The current patch will be necessary regardless of what is decided in regards to
passing the events on, and continues the status quo.
