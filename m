It certainly would provide a nice reduction in code size!

This would provide a zero-instructions preempt_disable() at the beginning
of the trampoline and a zero-instructions preempt_enable_no_resched() at
the end, correct?  If so, wouldn't this create a potentially long (though
"weak") preempt-disable region extending to the next preempt_enable(),
local_bh_enable(), schedule(), interrupt, transition to userspace,
or similar?  This could be quite some time.  Note that cond_resched()
wouldn't help, given that this is only in PREEMPT=y kernels.

The "weak" refers to the fact that if a second resched IPI arrived in the
meantime, preemption would then happen.  But without that second IPI,
the request for preemption could be ignored for quite some time.

Or am I missing something here?
