Speaking of searching, this kind of typeof use is, IMO, actively
harmful - it makes finding the places where we might get from
e.g. linked list to containing objects much harder.  container_of
(unless combined with obfuscating use of typeof()) at least gives
you a chance to grep - struct foo *not* followed by '*' is a pattern
that doesn't give too many false positives.  This one, OTOH, is
essentially impossible to grep for.
