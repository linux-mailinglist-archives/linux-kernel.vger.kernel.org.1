I agree, and I am working on changing this.

There have been discussions about co-processor register access a while
back in the LLVM/Clang community [1]. Peter Smith pointed this out in
the ClangBuiltLinux issue tracker [2], which also has some more context.
I did submit a patch [3] to convert use of cp10/cp11 in ARMv7 contexts
to a warning. However it got stale, I'll have to revisit.

There is actually another case where this issue blocks Clang's
integrated assembler: In arch/arm/kernel/perf_event_v7.c, function
venum_read_pmresr mcr/mrc is used to access the performance monitor
registers for Qualcomm's Krait/Scorpion PMU, and in this case there is
no mnemonic available.

These are good arguments I can use in case my patch stirs up a
discussion, thanks for the hints!

I'll try. We'll see.
