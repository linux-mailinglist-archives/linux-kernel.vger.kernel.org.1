Yes. Andrew will refresh it. He doesn't have a git tree which would
prevent rewriting the patch.

No worries. The mm patch workflow is rather different from others.

10k or any number of memcgs shouldn't really make much of a difference.
Except for the time the scan adds. Fundamentally we are talking about
freed objects and whether they are on the global or per memcg lists
should result in a similar behavior.

Yes, this is perfectly understandable. Having a bail out on fatal signal
is a completely reasonable thing to do. I am mostly confused by your
infinite loop claims and what the relation of this patch to it. I would
propose this wording instead

"
We have observed that drop_caches can take a considerable amount of
time (<put data here>). Especially when there are many memcgs involved
because they are adding an additional overhead.

It is quite unfortunate that the operation cannot be interrupted by a
signal currently. Add a check for fatal signals into the main loop
so that userspace can control early bailout.
"

or something along those lines.
