Changing the kernel to map the main executable with PROT_BTI by default is a
user-visible change in behaviour and not without risk, so if we're going to
do that then it needs to be opt-in because the current behaviour has been
there since 5.8. I suppose we could shoe-horn in a cmdline option for 5.10
(which will be the first LTS with BTI) but it would be better to put up with
the current ABI if possible.

Is there real value in this seccomp filter if it only looks at mprotect(),
or was it just implemented because it's easy to do and sounds like a good
idea?
