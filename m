Subject: [PATCH v2 0/9] libperf and arm64 userspace counter access support

This is resurrecting Raphael's series[1] to enable userspace counter
access on arm64. My previous version is here[2].

New in this version is adding userspace read support into libperf rather
than adding yet another copy of the read loop. Details are in patch 5.


The following changes to the arm64 support have been made compared to
Raphael's last version:

The major change is support for heterogeneous systems with some
restrictions. Specifically, userspace must pin itself to like CPUs, open
a specific PMU by type, and use h/w specific events. The tests have been
reworked to demonstrate this.

Chained events are not supported. The problem with supporting chained
events was there's no way to distinguish between a chained event and a
native 64-bit counter. We could add some flag, but do self monitoring
processes really need that? Native 64-bit counters are supported if the
PMU h/w has support. As there's already an explicit ABI to request 64-bit
counters, userspace can request 64-bit counters and if user
access is not enabled, then it must retry with 32-bit counters.

Prior versions broke the build on arm32 (surprisingly never caught by
0-day). As a result, event_mapped and event_unmapped implementations have
been moved into the arm64 code.

There was a bug in that pmc_width was not set in the user page. The tests
now check for this.

The documentation has been converted to rST. I've added sections on
chained events and heterogeneous.

The tests have been expanded to test the cycle counter access.
