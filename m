Understood.

Yeah, I was kind of expecting this reply :).

So the DT bit that triggered all this series is in
'arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm283x.dtsi'. Namely the interaction between
'cprman@7e101000' and 'dsi@7e209000.' Both are clock providers and both are
clock consumers of each other.

Well I had a second deeper look at the issue, here is how the circular
dependency breaks the boot process (A being soc, B being cprman and C being
dsi):

Device node A
	Device node B -> C
	Device node C -> B

The probe sequence is the following (with DL_FLAG_AUTOPROBE_CONSUMER):
1. A device is added, the rest of devices are siblings, nothing is done
2. B device is added, C device doesn't exist, B is added to
   'wait_for_suppliers' list with 'need_for_probe' flag set.
3. C device is added, B is picked up from 'wait_for_suppliers' list, device
   link created with B consuming from C.
4. C is then parsed, and tried to be linked with B as a consumer this time.
   This fails after testing for circular deps (by device_is_dependent()) du=
ring
   device_link_add(). This leaves C in the 'wait_for_suppliers' list *for e=
ver*
   as every further attempt at add_link() on C will fail.

-> Ultimately this prevents C for ever being probed, which also prevents B =
from
   being probed. Which isn't good as B is the main clock provider of the sy=
stem.

Note that B can live without C. I think some clock re-parenting will not be
accessible, but that's all.

My intuition would be, upon getting a circular dep from device_is_dependent=
()
with DL_FLAG_AUTOPROBE_CONSUMER to switch need_for_probe to false on both
devices.
