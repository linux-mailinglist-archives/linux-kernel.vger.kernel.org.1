Yes, after a quick look, I think your analysis here is correct.  So if
you can delete that, it would be nice if possible.

I don't know of any direct tests, I usually just booted into that mode
and saw if everything looked like it did before.  There must be some
tool that you can use to change the current font, as it seems to happen
at boot time on some distros.  I can't remember what it's called at the
moment...
