Judging by the pinctrl entries, these represent the number of pins 
provided by the SoC itself. Obviously boards need to override that if 
for some reason they don't wire up all the available data lines, but it 
seems backwards to have every board restate the SoC's default value.

In fact, having brought it up, for this particular case the pinctrl 
setting is inherently related to the bus width, so having one without 
the other in either place doesn't smell right.
