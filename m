I was initially thinking of something like

        if (static_branch_likely(&supports_deactivate_key))
                gic_write_eoir(irqnr);
        else if (__get_intid_range(irqnr) != SGI_RANGE)
                isb();

which is not particularly pretty, so maybe we should just slap this to the
isb():

                /* Superfluous for SGIs, but who cares */
