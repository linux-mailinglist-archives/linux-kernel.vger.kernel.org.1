I'm fine with "hisilicon,spmi-channel".

I agree, but, as I said before, without the datasheet, we can only
hardcode a small subset of the LDO settings.

Due to that, I prefer keeping it at DT - either grouped together at "reg" or 
as two separated properties (reg and vsel-reg).

This SoC is named Kirin 970. Yet, you can see places where 3670 is
used, like:

	https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/hisilicon/kirin/970

There, it says that Hi3670 is the part number.
