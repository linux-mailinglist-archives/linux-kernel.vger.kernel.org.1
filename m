Thanks Peter to Cc me.

Reusing kprobe blacklist is good to me as far as it doesn't expand it
only for kgdb. For example, if a function which can cause a recursive
trap issue only when the kgdb puts a breakpoint, it should be covered
by kgdb blacklist, or we should make a "noinstr-list" including
both :)

Thus, Nack for PATCH 4/4, that seems a bit selfish change. If kgdb wants
to use the "kprobes blacklist", we should make CONFIG_KGDB depending on
CONFIG_KPROBES. Or, (as I pointed) we should make independent "noinstr-list"
and use it from both.

Thank you,
