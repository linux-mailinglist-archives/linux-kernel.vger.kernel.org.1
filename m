I see that in case of HCI_VENDOR_PKT we need to check for the 2nd octet to be present, but I have no idea why you require 3 octets minimum. As I said, if so, then the other functions that get called require proper range checks.

Ah, I see. That makes sense, and I'm sorry for this. I just thought since
HCI_MAX_FRAME_SIZE was 4 more than 1024, min. len might have to be 4.
Taking a look at the reproducer, it becomes evident that the only reason this
patch didn't trigger an issue was because the reproducer ran with len = 3.

I don't really have a strong enough clue yet about where things are going wrong, so I'd
appreciate any guidance/insight into this, and where I should be looking. :/

Also, although the bug says it is only an uninit-value, it eventually ends up triggering
a kernel panic (looking at a log rather than a report shows that as well).

Thanks,
Anant
