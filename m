You can thank our legal department :-)

Hrm, I was thinking that SMAP=1 would give the necessary protections, but
in typing that out I realized userspace can throw in an RSP value that
points at kernel memory.  Duh.

One thought would be to have the TDX module (thing that runs in SEAM and
sits between the VMM and the guest) provide a TDCALL (hypercall from guest
to TDX module) to the guest that would allow the guest to specify a very
limited number of GPAs that must never generate a #VE, e.g. go straight to
guest shutdown if a disallowed GPA would go pending.  That seems doable
from a TDX perspective without incurring noticeable overhead (assuming the
list of GPAs is very small) and should be easy to to support in the guest,
e.g. make a TDCALL/hypercall or two during boot to protect the SYSCALL
page and its scratch data.
