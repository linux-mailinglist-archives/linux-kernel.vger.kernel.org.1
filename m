That's right, there is no practical case where the two are in conflict.
The problem that I'm solving here is that dev->dma_range_map is *always*
assigned, even when of_dma_get_range bailed and map still is NULL.

This has the effect of always overwriting what the MBUS driver does
(and leaking its memory too).

No, I think things are good in that regard. No messed up dt or anything like
that :)

Cheers,
