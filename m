The patch itself looks ok, although the description has an issue (IMHO).
Also, some references can be cleaned.

See below.

>    `Display text <#section-name-in-html>`__

Well, docutils define two types of references at:

	https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#referen=
ce-names

The first one are "simple reference names", defined as:

	``Simple reference names are single words consisting of
	  alphanumerics plus isolated (no two adjacent) internal
	  hyphens, underscores, periods, colons and plus signs;
	  no whitespace or other characters are allowed.``

On this type, "-_.,+" characters are allowed. "%" and "#" aren't.

The second one is "phrase-references", defined as:

	``Reference names using punctuation or whose names are phrases (two or mor=
e space-separated words) are called "phrase-references".``

Here, the spec doesn't specify the charset associated with "punctuation".

As this kind of reference is auto-generated from the chapter titles,
I would expect it to allow all ASCII punctuation characters
(e. g. all non-alphanumeric symbols between 0x20-0x7f).

So, a reference like those:
	#Summary
	#Forcing%20Quiescent%20States

Violates the spec, as it would be a simple reference with invalid
chars, but:

	#Forcing Quiescent States

Should be valid, according with the spec (still, while doing such
cleanup, I would remove "#").

I would add something like the above at the patch description.

Hmm... why are you ending "Summary" with a "_"? This should be
equivalent to:

	`summary <summary>`__

In this specific case, however, you could use, instead[1]:

	summary_

as there's no need to use an indirect hyperlink target here.

(the same applies to a few other similar cases on your patch)
