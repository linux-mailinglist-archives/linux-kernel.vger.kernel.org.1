x86's equivalent was implemented by commit 516cbf3730c4 ("x86, bootup:
add built-in kernel command line for x86 (v2)"). To summarize, you have
to enable CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL and then that lets you define built-in
command line parameters in CONFIG_CMDLINE. However, it is backwards in
that the command line provided by the bootloader is appended onto the
end of CONFIG_CMDLINE.

This doesn't seem as useful to me because, using the crashkernel=
example from above, the bootloader provided crashkernel= value may need
to be overridden by the built-in command line to provide a different
crashkernel= value for the particular kernel build being booted. Most
kernel command line parameter parsers are implemented in a way that
supports multiple instances of the parameter while only honoring the
last instance.
