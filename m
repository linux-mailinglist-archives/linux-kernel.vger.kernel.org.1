Yes, exactly.  Just to make sure we're on the same page, I suggest:

If a process modifies XCR0, then it cannot use ptrace().  Signal
delivery and sigreturn use the modified XCR0.  If you modify your XCR0
from within a signal handler, you get to keep both pieces.  If you
ptrace() a process with a modified XCR0, you see the full regset.
Among other things, this means that you could ptrace() a task with a
reduced XCR0, poke a value in one of the disabled register sets with
ptrace(), and read that same value back out again with ptrace().

Before you implement this, you might want to make sure that at least
one other x86 maintainer agrees with me. :)

I'm sure the CRIU people will notice this and want to find a way to
make ptrace() work from a modified-XCR0 process.  They are welcome to
propose semantics, since neither of the obvious ways to handle it
actually seem correct.
