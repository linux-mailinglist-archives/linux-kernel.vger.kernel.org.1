Upstream ath11k does not yet support QCN9074 so I don't see how this is
tested with mainline ath11k. You must be using some out-of-tree
_unofficial_ ath11k patches.

So currently QCN9074 firmware needs 55 MB of contiguous host memory and
I suspect one reason for these DT entries is an ugly hack to provide
that memory range to the firmware.

We are currently preparing QCN9074 patches for ath11k and finding a
solution how to implement these properly in ath11k. Hopefully there's no
need for hacks like this, we know more once we get the ath11k QCN9074
patches ready. Please drop this patch.
