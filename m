Actually, looking at the values there:

        .l2c_aux_val    = 0x3c400001,
-       .l2c_aux_mask   = 0xc20fffff,
+       .l2c_aux_mask   = 0xc20ffff8,

Bit 0 is L310_AUX_CTRL_FULL_LINE_ZERO feature bit, which platforms have
no business fiddling with - it is a Cortex-A9/L2C310 specific feature
that needs both ends to be configured correctly to work.  The L2C code
knows this and will deal with it.  So, .l2c_aux_val should drop setting
bit 0.

It's also setting L310_AUX_CTRL_NS_LOCKDOWN, which the kernel already
deals with - this bit should be dropped as well.

It's clearing L310_AUX_CTRL_CACHE_REPLACE_RR - this should be setup by
firmware.

For the prefetching, I thought there were DT properties for that.
Please look at that, and see whether you can eliminate most of the
.l2c_aux_val field set bits, and the .l2c_aux_mask clear bits.
