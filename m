Thankfully, I don't think the fudging is affected by the patch here, so I'm
inclined to take it as a fix. In fact, with this change, doesn't the prefix
of the regs returned in (2) look the same as the one you would expect in
32-bit arm?

Although you can obviously feed a 32-bit perf with a 64-bit perf.data,
a 32-bit task cannot spawn a 64-bit child so that rules out a lot of the
runtime weirdness, no?

afaict, perf just slurps all the registers in one go and hands them off
to the unwinder, which will index into them according to the dwarf unwind
tables. I have doubts as to how well that works (for example, unwinder
address corrections due to Thumb would not be applied).

So, I think we should take this patch (which puts the PC where you'd expect
to find it for compat tasks) and then we could consider removing the current
lr/sp fudging as a separate patch, which we could revert if it causes a
problem. However, I'm not sure I want to open that up.

What do you think?
