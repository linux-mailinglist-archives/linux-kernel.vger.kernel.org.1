My 2 cents:
DPCM should activate any BE which has:
* a valid DAPM path from the current FE
* a valid BE stream (ex: can handle the stream direction)

AFAIK, you can use any combination of DAPM elements to model your
components, including the XBAR. Then, it is the job of the card driver to
link the DAPM widgets of the different components together and bring the
system to life.

If your XBAR is widgets are not provided by a component which also
provides a dai_link in the sound card, you'll need to add the component
to the auxiliary device list of the card for the widget to be available
in the card.

What your are trying to achieve here is DAI chaining. From the DAPM
perspective, it is alright. Unfortunately this kind of chaining are
not supported (not yet, at least) from the dai_link perspective, even
with DPCM.


From the DPCM perspective, I think your patch does the following:

ADMAIF1(FE) ---> SFC(BE1)
            |--> I2S(BE2)
ADMAIF2(FE) ---> SFC(BE1)
            |--> I2S(BE2)

Your DAIs are not chained, but put in parallel. Maybe all your DAI
callbacks are called in a way that is convinient enough for your
use cases, but it is not what you intended.

For the example, the rate passed to 'I2S(BE2)' in hw_params() will
be the one provided by the 'ADMAIF', not the output rate of the 'SFC'.
