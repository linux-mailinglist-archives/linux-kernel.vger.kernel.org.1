I have no preference one way or another.

The issue is that our current master leads to mtds not working fine
and making the system unusable. Whatever we decide it must be fast and
the patch backported.

My original patch follows the same logic as led does where there is a
duplicated name. I can send a separate patch that uses mtdX and then
you decide what to pick. Or we can go with a third way, but it needs
to be soon ;)

Best regards!
