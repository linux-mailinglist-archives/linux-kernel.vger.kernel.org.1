Humm, the more concise, the better, so I think that we should use
metric: when we notice ambiguity, i.e. we should first lookup the
provided name as an event, and even if it resolves, look it up as well
as a metric, if both lookups work, then one need to disambiguate.

But then, why should we pick a name for a metric that is also a name for
an event? Can you think about a concrete case? Can't we detect this at
build time, when introducing the new metric and bail out?
