Err, true... I did say pipe dreams!

I had only really taken note of the exit / return to userspace
callbacks, but I see io_uring has its own task_work_run() calls, which
(I think) explains how we can end up with a kthread actually running
task_numa_work().

I'm also thinking we really don't want that task_numa_work() to be left
hanging on the task_work list, because that self-looping thing will not
play nice to whatever else has been queued (which AFAICT shouldn't happen
under normal conditions, i.e. !kthreads).
