As far as I understand the above isn't entirely correct. HW flow control is not
disabled when the RX FIFO is full, rather as part of HW flow control the
hardware deasserts RTS when the FIFO is full. Software flow control isn't really
relevant here, since it doesn't use RTS/CTS but uses transmission of special
codes (XON/XOFF) over TX/RX.

just noticed this: in the sleep config all pins are in GPIO config (see
"arm64: dts: sc7180: Add wakeup support over UART RX" from this series)
and by default they are inputs, hence the drive-strength here is pointless
IIUC.

I'm not sure this is an absolute truth. I think there may be cases where
the driver has to increase its drive strength..

I disgress. I'm pretty sure that you want RTS to be low to make sure that
the BT SoC can wake up the system by sending whatever data it has to send.
It won't do that if RTS is high (e.g. because that's its floating state
at that time). I just tried configuring a pull-up (also a known
non-ambiguous state), and Bluetooth wakeup doesn't work with that,
supposedly because the BT SoC/UART will wait for its CTS signal to be low.

also not needed, see above
