Right, for similar reason, I am not too keen on enabling these counters
without migration being enabled with ARCH_ENABLE_THP_MIGRATION.

Currently these are conditional on ARCH_ENABLE_THP_MIGRATION. So we are
not adding these new lines unless it migration is available and enabled.

Sure, we can add some trace points as well which can give more granular
details regarding THP migration mechanism itself e.g setting and removing
PMD migration entries etc probably with (vaddr, pmdp, pmd) details.

But we will still need /proc/vmstat entries that will be available right
away without requiring additional steps. This simplicity is essential for
folks to consider using these events more often.

Sure, will look into what trace points can be added for THP migration but
in a subsequent patch.
