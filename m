I can't speak for Saravana, but my sense is that moving functionality
to loadable modules is becoming more important for Android devices due
to their efforts to utilize a single kernel image across various
vendor devices[1].  Obviously with mobile device constraints
minimizing the unused vendor code in the kernel image is important,
and modules help there. While the unloading issues you raised are
important, one can still benefit from having a permanent module
(modules that don't have a .remove handler), as they can be only
loaded on the devices that use them. You're also right that irqchip
drivers are fairly small, but one issue is that any code they depend
on also has to be built in if they are not able to be configured as a
module, so by allowing the irqchip driver to be a module, you can also
modularize whatever platform calls are made from that driver.
