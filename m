Note that, KCSAN currently treats volatiles not as special, except a
list of some known global volatiles (like jiffies). This means, that
KCSAN will tell us about data races involving unmarked volatiles (unless
they're in the list).

As far as I can tell, this is what we want. At least according to LKMM.

If, for whatever reason, volatiles should be treated differently, we'll
have to modify the compilers to emit different instrumentation for the
kernel.
