Thanks, but I have to refuse both your admiration and sympathy:
mercifully, it was just something I noticed by source inspection
when working there.

I did then put in a debug count to see if it ever got hit in practice,
and checked after big multi-testing runs: it was sometimes hit, but
certainly not often, and I don't know what it was racing with when
it happened - would depend on filesystem anyway (ext4 in our case).

Saying "source inspection" reminds me: there is another funny in there,
but I don't think it matters very much in practice, and might need
rather a lot of testing to justify any particular patch: where
page_cache_sync_readahead() asks for PAGE_SIZE pages!

"end - index" seems a more reasonable number to me: but then we
might find that reading ahead into the next huge extent had actually
been a useful optimization (and those readahead functions impose
their own caps, so PAGE_SIZE shouldn't work out too outrageously).
