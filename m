Just the REGMAP bit.  Driver doesn't seem to be using regmap.

History I guess.   IIRC, a long time back, 0 was a valid IRQ for some architectures.

Fair enough. Would be nice if they could be established from a bus ID of
some type and the compatible but if we don't have the info to be able to
do that I guess we will have to do it this way.

Guess they all need switching to just being interrupt lines then.

I intended this as a more localized comment, though the following answers
another question I had.

request_threaded_irq is not using devm_ whilst the add devices is.
As a result we might have a path in which the irq goes away before
the device cleanup happens.

There are no ordering guarantees IIRC in mfd children coming up even
in the normal path.  It might currently happen in a particular order
but relying on that seems fragile to me.

Why do we need the regulators to come up in a particular order?
That sounds suspicious as any relationships between different ones should be expressed
either in DT or in the order they are enabled in the drivers using them.

cool. Good to get the extra build coverage.

Fair enough.  Guess this is one for Mark to ultimately decide.

I'd drop the comment then :)  If someone else wants to figure it out

Who needs storage? :)

More reasonable.
