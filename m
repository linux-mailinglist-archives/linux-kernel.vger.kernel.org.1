The testing was a mixed bag of wins and losses but wins more than it
loses. Biggest loss was a 9.04% regression on nas-SP using openmp for
parallelisation on Zen1. Biggest win was around 8% gain running
specjbb2005 on Zen2 (with some major gains of up to 55% for some thread
counts). Most workloads were stable across multiple Intel and AMD
machines.

There were some oddities in changes in NUMA scanning rate but that is
likely a side-effect because the locality over time for the same loads
did not look obviously worse. There was no negative result I could point
at that was not offset by a positive result elsewhere. Given it's not
a univeral win or loss, matching numa and lb balancing as closely as
possible is best so
