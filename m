Sure, I saw you just added a unit test, so I would assume that you
don't think that UTs are inherently bad :-)

I am in agreement with everything you said so far.

Not to be uncharitable in how I read this, but I don't think this is
quite right. I think we would all agree that a test that *cannot* fail
is a waste, but on the other hand, you should never submit code that
doesn't pass *good tests*, right? Like you wrote tests for your linear
range stuff to verify that it worked as expected; I don't know if some
of the tests didn't pass on the first try, but you did ultimately fix
all the issues, and submitted only tests that pass, right? I am pretty
sure no one would accept code accompanied with tests that don't pass.

So would a better way to phrase this be: "tests that can only pass are
a waste"? Or maybe, "tests that don't provide useful information on a
failure are a waste"?

Why not a bug later on? On another project, I noticed a piece of code
that kept breaking, so I added a test for that piece of code, and
people stopped breaking it: mission accomplished, right?

I don't understand, can you elaborate? From my experience, APIs are
frequently one of the most valuable places to test.

I agree with this statement, but I don't see how it shows that API
testing is inherently bad. I know you are countering David's statement
that it doesn't add much cost; however, I think that API testing not
only doesn't add much cost, if done properly, I think it actually
reduces future effort in changing those APIs.

True. There is no magic bullet here. UTs are but one tool in a
toolbox; there are other tools better suited to solve some problems,
and no problem is likely to be solved well if the person using the
tool uses the tool improperly. I don't think anyone here thinks that
UTs are inherently good and all UTs make all code better.

I honestly don't know. TBH, I think I have a good idea what a good
test case should look like, as for measuring how useful a test case
is, that's harder and I am not sure anyone really has a great answer
for this. I just read a literature review on measuring code quality
and they concluded that coverage provided only a weak signal at best
and the best signal came from "engineers' perception of code quality".

The way I usually write tests is: I write my code first. I then write
some unit tests to exercise some basic features of my code. Then I
write some integration or end-to-end tests to make sure my code "fits"
in the job it's supposed to do. If everything works, I am done. If
not, then I start writing tests to narrow down what doesn't work the
way I expect. Eventually I write a test that clearly exposes the
issue. I fix the issue, and I rerun the tests to make sure they flip
from fail to pass. I then look through all the new tests I wrote and
try to make a judgement call about how useful I think the test will be
in the future. (I am curious what other people's thoughts are on this
approach.)

When it comes down to it, I don't know this code base well enough to
know whether all these registration tests are useful, but I think, as
they are written, they are easy to understand, and that is what I was
reviewing.

This is all a very long way of saying: "I think this is a question for
Stephen" :-)

Fair enough. And I think that's great! Unit testing is "new" to the
Linux kernel and I want to make sure we do it the right way. From my
experience, I think the best way to bring about a "new" thing like
this is to get someone who is overly liberal in adopting the new
thing, someone who is more conservative, and maybe some invested, but
less opinionated bystanders and make them all try to agree.

Once we have debated over a number of tests, it should start getting
easier. Hopefully, a good pattern will emerge and people will start
following that pattern.

True, but if enable is *super prone to breakage* then having a test
that tells you whether you broke it might still be more useful than
not. Stephen, thoughts?

Agreed.

Probably semantics, but I would argue what is clean and simple to one
person is often not to someone else. A test at least gives you an
isolated context to test your assumptions.

Thank *you*! It is good to have someone challenging our ideas. I get
worried when I don't have anyone questioning what I am doing: being
questioned is the only way that I can feel confident that what I am
doing is right. And in this case, I think you have leveled a number of
good points.

Cheers!
