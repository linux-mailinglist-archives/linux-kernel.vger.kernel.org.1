net::count is a counter, which indicates whether net is alive and still
initilized. net::passive does not guarantees that net has not been
deinitialized yet.

The same with another namespaces. All of merged counters indicate
that a namespace is alive and initialized. So, we merge them by this property.

The only visible current effect is better readability and better
debugability with, say, crash on kernel dump.

Since namespaces are different by type, they require different destructors.
Generic counter can't solve any problem, the namespaces can address.

I don't see any performance impact during namespace creation/destruction
test.
