Woo-hoo!!!

But is that one combination actually in use anywhere?  ;-)

Sounds about right.  ;-)

Does reclaim have any notion of having continuously scanned for
longer than some amount of time?  Or could RCU reasonably deduce this?
For example, if RCU noticed that reclaim had been scanning for longer than
(say) five grace periods, RCU might decide to speed things up.

But on the other hand, with slow disks, reclaim might go on for tens of
seconds even without much in the way of memory pressure, mightn't it?

I suppose that another indicator would be recent NULL returns from
allocators.  But that indicator flashes a bit later than one would like,
doesn't it?  And has false positives when allocators are invoked from
atomic contexts, no doubt.  And no doubt similar for sleeping more than
a certain length of time in an allocator.

Looking forward to hearing of any results!

Indeed, that dialog box should be especially useful for things like
light bulbs running Linux.  ;-)
