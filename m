I'll try to create a very simple reproducer for this case in the next
days. Unfortunately I don't have the source of the original application.
I can mail you instructions about it directly, if required.

Check the other mail from Ricardo, you can probably safe that effort :-)

Yeah that seems like the less favorable effort. My best guess is that
this might not be limited to Wine thus handling in the kernel might be
best.

Nice, I'll use that next time :-)
