Since we have talked about The Sami, which actually is an islamicized 
name, we can talk about Ash Guard also. I actually grew up in what was 
called Ash Guard before. Home of the Vikings, that were romanized. And 
is represented still in Ufo-myth.

Interesting about this place is that it was meant to be a disbelieving 
place, "Ash Guard". But later ofcourse ADL is also an islamicized name 
of The Royals, that once were Vikings. It all was christianiziced, and 
represented in Jehova. And is futher Islamicized in these days, with 
I-T, where La Quran, is perfect as Fair Pay background in I-T sector.

Serenity!
