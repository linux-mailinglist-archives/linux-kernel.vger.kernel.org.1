I checked the memory bandwidth of the biggest system, the Skylake.  Couldn't
find official specs for it, all I could quickly find were stream results from a
blog post of ours that quoted a range of about 123-145 GB/s over both nodes
when compiling with gcc.  That's with all CPUs.

Again using all CPUs, multithreaded page init is doing 41 GiB/s per node
assuming it's just touching the 64 bytes of each page struct, so assuming
there's more memory traffic than just struct page, it seems another part of the
reason for only 10x is we're bottlenecked on memory bandwidth.
