My point is: when do you attach panel to a connector?
In this patch,

ret =3D drm_bridge_attach(&dsi->encoder, &dsi->bridge, NULL,
                                          DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR);

it would call into mtk_dsi_bridge_attach() with
DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR, and call into panel_bridge_attach()
with DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR.
If you does not pass DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR into
panel_bridge_attach(), it would create a connector and attach panel to
that connector.
And you pass DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR into
panel_bridge_attach(), so I thiink you need to create connector and
attach panel to that connector by yourself (this is what omap does).

Chun-Kuang.
