This is a little confusing, since it reads like the 39-bit VA 
configuration is itself non-architectural, which it obviously isn't.

The *only* way to preserve an existing configuration is to make a 
hard-coded assumption about what it probably is? Really? Not, say, 
actually reading back the currently-configured value? :/

What's the actual UBS value reported? If it's 40 then arguably the main 
driver could be cleverer and use 39 bits for stage 1 domains anyway to 
save a level of pagetable. However...

I'm concerned that "any configuration change" and "maximum" don't appear 
to add up. What if we decided we want to use short-descriptor format (or 
just pick a 32-bit VA size for other reasons)? That's happily less than 
39 bits, but would still represent a change *from* 39 bits, so would it 
also kill the system? IIRC Jordan's split pagetable support will end up 
configuring contexts with TxSZ based on va_bits / 2, so now 38 bits - is 
that going to work?

If you need to impose specific restrictions on context bank format, just 
bodging va_bits isn't going to cut it. You'd need to adjust the domain 
and pagetable configuration directly in ->init_context() in very much 
the same way as the split pagetable support itself does.

That said, I still hold the opinion that if you can't reprogram the 
context banks then this is qcom-iommu territory, not arm-smmu.
