That was my suggestion, the whole history is that I submitted a patch
removing this driver as it was not getting compiled and so didn't go
through the componentization. See
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200507212912.599433-1-alexandre.belloni@bootlin.com/

My point was that if we were to keep that driver, the goal would be to
have it out of staging instead of simply making it compile.
