From what I understand this current path was entered after Greg's
original suggestion from
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200828102704.GB1470435@kroah.com
to replace the pr_xxx() calls with the more informative dev_xxx() ones.

Perhaps all that is needed to follow the original suggestion is to
replace the pr_xxx() calls with dev_xxx(acrn_dev.this_device, ...) ?

(An example of this is drivers/input/serio/userio.c and some others)

The device (acrn_dev.this_device) can be trusted to exist for the
lifetime of the driver since it is removed on module unload where the
misc device is unregistered.
