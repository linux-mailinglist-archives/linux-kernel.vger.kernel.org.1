That's the 'normal' state for blocking locks, no?

See how both struct mutex and struct rw_semaphore have internal locks.

up_{read,write}() / mutex_unlock() release 'B', the actual lock, early,
and then take 'A', the internal lock, to actually implement the release.

That way lockdep doesn't see the B-A order :-)

Any cases that aren't covered by the current implementation of rwsems ?
