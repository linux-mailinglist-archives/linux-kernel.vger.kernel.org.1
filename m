Hi Will,

Generally I don't think that DMI is reliable, and I saw this as the 
least preferred choice. I'm looking at the sysfs DMI info for my dev 
board, and I don't even see anything like a SoC identifier.

As for the event_source device sysfs identifier file, it would not 
always contain effectively the same as the SoC ID.

Certain PMUs which I'm interested in plan to have probe-able 
identification info available in future.

Thanks,
John
