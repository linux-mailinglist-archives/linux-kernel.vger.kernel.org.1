I think it is dirty bit if updating access bit doesn't need flush TLB.

Thanks for confirming this. I didn't realize pte_mkdirty() also clears 
read-only bit on arm.

I think so if I understand the code correctly.

As I mentioned in the commit log, there 3 places which could return 
VM_FAULT_RETRY then retry page fault.

The first two cases (swap and readahead) just return before PTEs are 
installed, so the retried page fault should not reach here at all (just 
finish the handling in do_fault() or do_swap_page() like the first try).

So only dirty pages throttling may reach here since the throttling 
happens after PTEs are setup. The write fault handler already set PTEs 
with dirty bit, please see the below code snippet from alloc_set_pte():

entry = mk_pte(page, vma->vm_page_prot);
         entry = pte_sw_mkyoung(entry);
         if (write)
                 entry = maybe_mkwrite(pte_mkdirty(entry), vma);

So the retried page fault should come in with dirty bit set.

Of course the parallel page fault may set up PTEs, but we just need care 
about write fault. If the parallel page fault setup a writable and dirty 
PTE then the retried fault doesn't need do anything extra. If the 
parallel page fault setup a clean read-only PTE, the below code should 
be executed in the retried page fault:

if (vmf->flags & FAULT_FLAG_WRITE) {
         if (!pte_write(entry))
             return do_wp_page(vmf);
         entry = pte_mkdirty(entry);

The retried fault should just call do_wp_page() then return.
