Ah. I wasn't aware of this problem.

Right. It doesn't make that much sense to use memblock to find free
memory areas for the kexec kernel, because memblock tracks which memory
areas are free for the currently running kernel. But that's not what
matters for the kernel that will be kexec'd into. In this case, regions
which may be reserved for the current OS instance may well be free for a
freshly started kernel. The kdump method is better at knowing which
memory regions are actually reserved by the firmware/hardware.

Yes, since the kdump kernel and the "regular" kexec kernel can't be both
booted at the same time, it's not a problem if both plan to use the same
region of memory.
