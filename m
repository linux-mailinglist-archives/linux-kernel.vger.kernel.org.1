I know but I didn't want to go into that much detail but you're right of
course! :)

It is a supported case however unlikely. I just tried to answer
Dominique's specific question pointing out that even in that unlikely
case sighand_struct is stable.

Just as an fyi, CLONE_SIGHAND with CLONE_VM but without CLONE_THREAD is
actually used quite a bit, e.g. in newlib, in stress-ng, and in criu.
Actually for some use-cases with userfaultfd if you want to handle
pagefaults in the child, you'd want CLONE_VM which enforces
CLONE_SIGHAND so that would be another use-case afaict.

And honestly, quite often this combo is used in helper processes that
share as much context as possible without CLONE_THREAD to do as little
work as possible in terms of allocations and so on in the kernel.
(Another interesting use-case could arise with CLONE_SIGHAND +
 CLONE_CLEAR_SIGHAND as it allows you to reset both the parent's and
 child's signal handler in one shot.)
