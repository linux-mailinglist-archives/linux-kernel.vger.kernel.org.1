No, that's not what I'm trying to ask here. Bad example, sorry. I'm
trying to understand why is it necessary to slit the connector into
three separate interfaces? There does not seem to be anything in the
kernel that would benefit from that. Why isn't the connector described
as a single interface in devicetree?

My concern with the three separate interfaces is that they may force
us to know in kernel which of the three interfaces are association
with a mode, and actually not just the mode, but the possible the pin
configurations of the mode. That is something that we may end up
having to hard code into the drivers, even though it does not provide
any useful information to us, and that would not be OK.

Right now they also allow making assumptions regarding the alternate
modes since there are no "bindings" for those, for example, if these
OF graph ports have an endpoint to the DP, it means DP alt mode is
supported. But that is of course not true. DisplayPort is used also
with other alternate modes. We must never make any assumptions based
on those interfaces. So again, why do we have them?

Either I'm missing something, or the devicetree description of the
Type-C connectors really is way too complex, way too "low level",
causing us potential problems without providing anything that we could
actually ever use in the operating system.
