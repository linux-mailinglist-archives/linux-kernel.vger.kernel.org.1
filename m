If we did this via a special GPU SMMU instance then we could also create and
register a dummy TTBR0 instance along with the TTBR1 instance and then we
wouldn't need to worry about the aux domains at all.

I don't want to speak for Rob but I think that this is the same direction we've
landed on. If we use the implementation specific code to initialize the base
pagetables then the GPU driver can use io-pgtable directly. We can easily
construct an io_pgtable_cfg. This feature will only be available for opt-in
GPU targets that will have a known configuration.

The only gotcha is TLB maintenance but Rob and I have ideas about coordinating
with the GPU hardware (which has to do a TLBIALL during a switch anyway) and we
can always use the iommu_tlb_flush_all() hammer from software if we really need
it. It might take a bit of thought, but it is doable.

I'm not sure how ugly it is. I've always operated under the assumption that the
GPU SMMU was special (though it had generic registers) just because of where it
was and how it it was used.  In the long run baking in a implementation specific
solution would probably be preferable to lots of domain attributes and aux
domains that would never be used except by us.

I'll hack on this and try to get something in place. It might be dumber on the
GPU side than we would like but it would at least spur some more conversation.
