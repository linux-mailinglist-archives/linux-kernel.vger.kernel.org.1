Hi, how about a more descriptive subject, such as

mm/vmscan: add new anonymous pages to inactive LRU list

detection similar to the one that's already applied to file LRU.

a "v6" note is more suitable for a diffstat area than commit log, but it's good
to mention this so drop the 'v6:'?

I guess this could be "if (unlikely(unevictable) && ..." to match the previous
if (likely(evictable)) else ...
