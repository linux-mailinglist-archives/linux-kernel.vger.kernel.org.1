I agree you have to draw the line somewhere, there will always be
someone somewhere that's offended by something. But this seems like a
pretty easy case.

It's not like blacklist / whitelist are even good to begin with, it's
not obvious which is which, you have to learn that black is bad and
white is good.

Blocklist (or denylist?) and allowlist are actually more descriptive and
less likely to cause confusion.
