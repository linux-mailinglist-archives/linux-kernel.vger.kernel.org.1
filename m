Starting from the scheduler-clock interrupt's call into RCU,
we have rcu_sched_clock_irq() which calls rcu_pending() which
calls check_cpu_stall() which calls either print_cpu_stall() or
print_other_cpu_stall(), depending on whether the stall is happening on
the current CPU or on some other CPU, respectively.

Both of these last functions acquire the rcu_node structure's raw ->lock
and expect to do printk()s while holding it.

Not that the lock matters all that much given that all of this code is
in hardirq context.  Which is necessary if RCU CPU stall warnings are
to be at all reliable.  Yeah, yeah, they would be even more reliable if
invoked in NMI context but that would prevent them from acquiring the
->lock that is used to resolve races between multiple concurrent stall
warnings and between a stall warning and the end of that stall.  ;-)

I could imagine accumulating the data in hardirq context and then
using a workqueue or some such to print it all out, but that
requires that workqueues be fully operational for RCU CPU stall
warnings to appear.  :-(

Thoughts?

Once we get to it, your thought would be to do per-CPU queuing of
memory from IRQ-off kfree_rcu(), and have IRQ work or some such clean
up after it?  Or did you have some other trick in mind?
