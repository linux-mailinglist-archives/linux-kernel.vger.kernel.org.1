Does your system give access to the UEFI shell? If so, could you
please try booting the [uncompressed] Image file from the command
prompt? Which hardware are you booting?

Quite the opposite, unfortunately. It means the feature you are using
to fix your boot issue is going away.

down first. If there is a real kernel issue here that needs
__efistub_global to be fixed, we obviously won't be removing it.
