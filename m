On the system we're using it on, there's no DMA whatsoever. It just
used to allow memory allocations suitable for DMA (which any
allocation vacuuously is when there's no DMA) but now it doesn't, due
to your change.

Just below the if block in question in this thread is:

	host->readback.is_dma_mapped = (host->dma_dev != NULL);

and similar conditions appear elsewhere all over the file in the form
of if (host->dma_dev). Of course doing DMA requires a link to a DMA
controller device, and plenty SPI devices (most obviously bit-banged
ones) lack DMA.

The right condition for the block in question here is probably just
checking dma_dev instead of dma_mask or CONFIG_HAS_DMA, but it seems
useful to optimize out the code if CONFIG_HAS_DMA is false, anyway.
