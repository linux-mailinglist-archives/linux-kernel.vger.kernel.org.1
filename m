I stand correct, I only checked the released version.

I agree.

I don't question the fact that 'okay' is the default status if it is not
explicitly present. There is no better default than that.

A bit later on that.

this is different, these patches just removing the "status = 'okay';"
lines where they are not needed and can be omitted to save few lines and
it does help on readablity.

Correct, the resulted dtb is identical. If the developer for upcoming
boards did check the schematics vs TRM vs dtsi and spot the things that
is not configured.
dtb check will complain when it is starting to check against the
documentation, but McASP is not yet converted to yaml and to be honest I
don't want to convert the current binding to be the binding. When it was
done it just moved pdata variables to DT and that was wrong.
This is off-topic a bit.

Yes, we leave the non working/configured node 'okay' in dtsi and expect
that the board file author will know which node must be disabled because
it is incomplete.

I had my saying on that ever since I have been taking care of audio on
TI SoCs ;)

I used similar analogy in a private thread around this, but imho it fits
the case neatly:
car == McASP

you don't put an 'okay' (as is ready, operational) stamp on the car in
the middle of the production line when the engine is not even installed.

Not sure, I'm 'whatever' after [1] makes it to mainline or next.

I'm fine whatever way we take, but I think it is up to you to make the
call as the maintainer of the TI dts files... ;)

If we take this road, than I'm okay with it, but I'm going to take
silent protest (not sending acked-by or revired-by).
That should not stop you doing what you believe is best for the future!

fwiw, McASP will have sane handling for the variations of 'okay':
