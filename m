The main things are that we need to pass the information of raw events
and the information of mapping of generic hardware events. Maybe
this information could be passed by this SBI call.

I would prefer to read the counter directly on s-mode. Spec already defines the
mechanism to allow that. But this way would still work if we couldn't
read counters
on s-mode.

We also need a SBI call to set the event selector to specify which event
is monitored.

Ok, let us talk about the details in that.
