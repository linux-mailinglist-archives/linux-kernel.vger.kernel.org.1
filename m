Hi Bjorn,

Thanks for the review. I'll incorporate the changes if we decide to
that this DT should live upstream.

I wasn't aware of the dt-update tool, and it seems pretty neat.
However, a thought I had is that using it to enable a dt-node or a
board variant is not very different from applying a patch the the
upstream tree. The work it takes to do it is about the same, and the
maintenance burden of using a patch is about the same as using
dt-tool.
