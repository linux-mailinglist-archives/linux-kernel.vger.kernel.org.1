That's the Exynos VDD_INT/CPU issue.  I'm not clear that this is
entirely covered TBH, AIUI it needs a coupler all the time so it's not
just a case of waiting for the consumers.

Please include human readable descriptions of things like commits and
issues being discussed in e-mail in your mails, this makes them much
easier for humans to read especially when they have no internet access.
I do frequently catch up on my mail on flights or while otherwise
travelling so this is even more pressing for me than just being about
making things a bit easier to read.

Yes, I think a lot of this is about clarity of explanation.

Since your current implementation restricts things until essentially the
entire system is running this is going to affect consumers that don't
share their regulator.  Part of the reason I am so against that idea is
that when it is very important that a driver be able to change the
voltage and have that actually take effect usually the hardware will be
built such that that regulator isn't shared so shareability issues don't
apply, we have regulator_get_exclusive() for such situations though
it's wound up not as widely used as it could be for a bunch of reasons.
Things like MMC where we have to conform to a hardware spec that
includes lowering as well as raising voltages will have issues with
this.

This is your systems - it is not that unusual for systems to come up
with most if not all of the regulators up in order to keep things
simpler, it's generally easier during bringup and people don't always
see any particular reason to modify the bootloader to change things (and
may not be easily able to customize what the PMIC does itself even if
they wanted to do things at that level).  Such systems will be very much
impacted by this change.
