    tracing/doc: Fix ascii-art in histogram-design.rst
    
    This fixes the Sphinx parallel build error when building htmldocs:
    
      docutils.utils.SystemMessage: /home/sfr/next/next/Documentation/trace/histogram-design.rst:219: (SEVERE/4) Unexpected section title.
    
    It also fixes a bunch of other warnings I noticed when fixing the
    above, caused by mixing ascii-art and text.

 This is very similar to the basic case.  In the above diagram, we can     | | |
 see a new .flags member has been added to the struct hist_field           | | |
 struct, and a new entry added to hist_data.fields representing the ts0    | | |
 variable.  For a normal val hist_field, .flags is just 0 (modulo          | | |
 modifier flags), but if the value is defined as a variable, the .flags    | | |

 As you can see, the ts0 entry's .var.idx member contains the index        | | |

 This idx is used whenever the value of the variable is set or read.       | | |

 The sched_switch histogram paired with the above sched_waking               | |
 histogram is shown below.  The most important aspect of the                 | |
 sched_switch histogram is that it references a variable on the              | |

 The histogram diagram is very similar to the others so far displayed,       | |
 but it adds variable references.  You can see the normal hitcount and       | |
 key fields along with a new wakeup_lat variable implemented in the          | |
 same way as the sched_waking ts0 variable, but in addition there's an       | |
