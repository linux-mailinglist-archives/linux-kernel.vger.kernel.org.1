yeah, in the dp case, having phy split out makes a ton of sense.. it
would maybe be a nice cleanup in other cases (dsi, hdmi) but the
combination of usb+dp makes burying this in drm not so great..

It would be good if you could work w/ sboyd on this.. based on what
I've seen on previous gens, it is probably a different phy driver for
7nm vs 10nm, but I think where we want to end up upstream is with phy
split out of drm.

Yeah, the idea to land dp isn't that it is perfect (or even not
broken), so much as having something upstream gives a common base for
others to work against.. maybe we should make the dp parts 'depends on
STAGING'?

I could keep a separate msm-next-dp branch that I rebase, to give a
common point for folks working dp support for various different gens
to coordinate work on.. that kinda sounds like a bunch of extra work
for me, so might as well land what we have somehow and work together
from there ;-)

But it does sound like you are making the case for including the patch
to drop the pll stuff and use phy framework as part of what initially
goes upstream.
