There's pros and cons, as usual.  Yet another macro(s) versus sorter/more 
readable code.  This is why i decided to spam the list (and Paul) - in search 
for another opinion.

Which would be unfortunate.

I just wish there was C type declaration that would force the compiler to do 
what READ/WRITE_ONCE() does now, but i also know this is too naive... :)
