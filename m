This patch series needs more explanation about what "metadata encryption" is,
why people will want to use it (as opposed to either not using it, or using
fscrypt + dm-crypt instead), and why this is the best implementation of it.

I notice this is missing the step I suggested to include the metadata encryption
key in the HKDF application-specific info string when deriving subkeys from the
fscrypt master keys.

The same effect could also be achieved by adding an additional level to the key
hierarchy: each HKDF key would be derived from a fscrypt master key and the
metadata encryption key.

We need one of those, to guarantee that the file contents encryption is at least
as strong as the "metadata encryption".
