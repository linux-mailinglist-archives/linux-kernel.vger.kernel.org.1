Which can also be done without adding the second local var in kobject_cleanup(),

Subject: [PATCH] kobject: Make sure the parent does not get released before its children

In the function kobject_cleanup(), kobject_del(kobj) is
called before the kobj->release(). That makes it possible to
release the parent of the kobject before the kobject itself.

To fix that, adding function __kboject_del() that does
everything that kobject_del() does except release the parent
reference. kobject_cleanup() then calls __kobject_del()
instead of kobject_del(), and separately decrements the
reference count of the parent kobject after kobj->release()
has been called.
