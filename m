What is that in percentage terms?

Unfortunately I think we are past the point of returning to the tasklet.

sdhci can complete requests in the irq handler but only if ->pre_req() and
->post_req() are used, which is not supported by SDIO at present.  pre_req
and post_req were introduced to reduce latency for the block driver, so it
seems reasonable perhaps to look at using them in SDIO as well.
