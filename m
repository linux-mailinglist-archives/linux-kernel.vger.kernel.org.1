Yesï¼Œ I agree with you it . But in my HW platform, using virtualization, the performance
deteriorates greatly.  So I distributed the I/O devices to different operation systems. During the startup of one OS,
interrupts are bound to different OS in one OS, which can be exclusive of concurrent modifications.

In fact it has some limitations as you said, such mask/enable/route Interrupts, If want to
mask interrupts, need to mask interrupts on the source device.

If you think it is not a common feature, I will used it as a local customization function and not upstream.
