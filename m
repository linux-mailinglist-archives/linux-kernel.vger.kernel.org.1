Remove the 'dma-ranges' property should also work. After all, it is equivalent
to the original empty dma-ranges scheme. In addition, since the IOMMU nodes are
defined, it should be enabled. Therefore, Arnd's concern about the scenario where
the IOMMU is disabled may not be triggered. All roads lead to Rome. Which solution
should be chose depends on individual preferences. For me, either solution is fine.

The third solution is to define a non-empty dma-ranges property. However, because
stingray-usb.dtsi is included in multiple files, it may not be appropriate.
