Aha, I was wondering what happened to this bug report. :)

Does that fill up the page cache enough to push memory reclaim?

XFS and ext4 both validate the ondisk csum when constructing their
incore inodes, and set them when flushing the incore inode back to disk.

I vaguely wonder if there's something else going on here, like ... a
background memory reclaim thread running on one cpu writes out an inode
core with new checksum (because reading the file bumped the atime), and
then another cpu comes along and has to reconstitute the (just
reclaimed) incore inode, but for whatever reason doesn't get the version
that the other cpu just wrote?

That's like 130% speculative though, and note that I have no idea what
the "outer shareable" domain[1] is.

(FWIW I haven't seen checksum errors on xfs or ext4 on arm64, though
most of my testing is relegated to beating on a raspberry pi very
slowly...)

Well if you've managed to hit this on multiple different machines after
a long soak time, I wonder how many other people will trip over this too.
It wouldn't be the first time a fs stunts performance to avoid
corruption. ;)

Strange.  You're just using the same ext4_inode_csum() that everything
else uses, right?
