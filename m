Thanks, I'll be sure to avoid using 3202fa62f as the cause next time.
I just thought to do that because it was what made the use-after-free cause
a noticeable bug.

Also, by the way, I just realised the patch didn't completely solve the bug=
.
Sorry about that, making an LKML thread on this was hasty on my part. Shoul=
d
I get further confirmation from the Bugzilla thread before submitting a pat=
ch
for this bug in the future?

Thanks,
