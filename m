Oh, fear not, I fully appreciate that keeping the GPU stalled on a 
faulting transaction is a game-changer in itself ("almost like a real 
MMU!"). That comment was only aimed at whatever the perceived benefits 
are of deliberately not trying to clear the SMMU interrupt (even if it 
*would* stay clear). I have no issue with calling report_iommu_fault(), 
I'm just wary of doing anything weird with the result.

Phew! Thanks for the reassurance :)
