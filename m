I agree with you that automatic solution would be best, but I just don't see 
it how it would be done. Dual head display pipeline is pretty complex for 
clock driver to get it right on it's own. There are different possible setups 
and some of them are hot pluggable, like HDMI. And there are also SoC specific 
quirks, like A64, where for some reason, MIPI DPHY and HDMI PHY share same 
clock parent - PLL_VIDEO0. Technically, MIPI DPHY can be clocked from 
PLL_PERIPH0 (fixed to 600 MHz), but that's not really helpful. I'm not even 
sure if there is any good solution to this - certainly HDMI and MIPI can't 
claim exclusivity and somehow best common rate must be found for PLL_VIDEO0, 
if that's even possible. I was sure that HDMI PHY on A64 can be clocked from 
PLL_VIDEO1, which would solve main issue, but to date, I didn't find any way to 
do that.

That's pretty off topic, so I hope original patch can be merged as-is.

Best regards,
Jernej
