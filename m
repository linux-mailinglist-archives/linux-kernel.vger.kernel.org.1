Thanks!  Kudos to Stefan and you for giving me the comments for the change.

As abovely mentioned in 'Future Plans' section, DAMON will be highly
configurable.  You can see the plan in more detail via the RFC patchset[1].
Thus, the minimal region size will also be able to configured as users want,
including the size of the hugepage.

Good point.  However, as you also mentioned, DAMON will slowly, but eventually
adjust the regions appropriately.

And yes, your suggested solution will work pretty well.  Indeed, my one
previous colleague found this problem on a few of special workloads and tried
the solution you suggested.  The improvement was clear.

However, I didn't adopt the solution due to below reasons.

First, IMHO, this is an accuracy improvement, rather than bug fix.  But the
extent of the enhancement didn't seem very critical to me.  Most of other
workloads didn't show such problem (and thus improvement).  Even with the
workloads showing the problem, the problem was not seem so critical.

Second, if the low accuracy is problem, users could get higher accuracy by
simply adjusting the sampling interval and/or aggregation interval to lower
value.  This is the supposed way to trade the accuracy with the overhead.

Finally, I would like to keep code as simple as it can.

For same reasons, I would like to keep the code as currently is until real user
problem is reported.  If you have different opinions, please feel free to yell
at me.
