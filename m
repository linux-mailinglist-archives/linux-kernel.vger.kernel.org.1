Dear Hauke and friends,

Based on some forsaken sources for linux and uboot, I have managed to
re-create most of the clock layout of the Lantiq VR9.

With this information I've been able to modify the device tree
structure and create a minor set of drivers in order migrate to CCF.

The code is now available at:
	https://github.com/Mandrake-Lee/openwrt/tree/LTQ_PORTING_CLK_FRAMEWORK

Also, I've tried to gather all relevant information with references
here:
	https://github.com/Mandrake-Lee/Lantiq_XWAY_CGU

There's also a fancy schematic:
	https://github.com/Mandrake-Lee/Lantiq_XWAY_CGU/blob/master/VR9_CGU_v0_202=
00503.pdf

Unfortunately the status so far is UNSTABLE although I have the feeling
that we must be very close to the end.

The boot-up logging is mostly standard but right after kernel modules
are loaded and eth driver detects a link, the system hangs-up and
reboots after 30s roughly. There's no log message at all.

There're still some seconds where a terminal is operative though, so I
guess there's a module loading that crashes without trace.

So any help and comments are really appreciated.

In parallel, the only big "black box" that remains is the PCIe PLL
register meaning. I would appreciate if someone from Lantiq (now Intel)
could give a hand.

Best regards,
Jorge Amor=F3s-Argos
