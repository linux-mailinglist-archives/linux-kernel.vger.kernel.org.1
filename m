I discussed earlier also the monotheistic angle on this, and I think the 
easiest route is considering what latin alphabet supports, and using the 
four letter definite form, The Ilah here.

Since Islam is an intelligent religion, and the ban on Amanita is the 
beginning of civilized principles, and the root of written fair pay 
principles, I think this is very good for computing space.

Serenity,
