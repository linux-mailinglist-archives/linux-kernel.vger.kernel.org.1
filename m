Theoretically, this could be bit tricky if we need to support platforms
without Rx channel for base protocol but may have Rx for some specific
protocols. But we have other problems too, so we can address that if
required in future.

Anyways, the first 4 patches are simple and quite independent from the
notification part. I will queue them as is and you can drop if you respin
the series.

I may need some time to go through the series completely and I am trying
to comment as I go through individual patches as I may get answers to
my own questions as I review.
