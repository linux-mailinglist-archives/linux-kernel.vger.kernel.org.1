Subject: [PATCH v3 0/3] SCMI System Power Support

Hi all,

this series wants to add the core SCMI System Power support and related
events' handling logic: the protocol support itself is trivial and boils
down to some bare initializations and supporting one SCMI System Power
notification event meant to carry platform-originated System transition
requests. This is patch [1/3].

On top of this a new SCMI driver has been developed which registers for
such System Power notification and acts accordingly to satisfy such
plaform system-state transition requests that can be of forceful or
graceful kind.

In order to comply with such graceful requests, and co-operate with
userspace entities to drive a clean shutdown/reboot, the logic of the
driver relies on the same orderly_* API methods used by ACPI when handling
ACPI Shutdown bus events.
As an alternative method to tunnel graceful requests to userspace it is
possible to configure, via available module parameters, a specific signal
to be sent to CAD pid. This is patch [2/3].

Patch [3/3] is a mere JUNO example of the minimal DT bindings needed to
enable the protocol at the DT level and is NOT meant to be upstream as of
now.

The series is based on SCMI Notifications Core V10 [1] (only posted not
merged) which in turn is based on top of scmi-for-next 5.8-rc1

Thanks

Cristian
