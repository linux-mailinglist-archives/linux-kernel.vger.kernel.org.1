LTO is actively being worked on, now up to v6:
https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/20201013003203.4168817-1-samitolvanen@google.com/
And in the real world it's already being used; the Android Compatibility
Definition Document strongly recommends enabling CFI, which depends on LTO.

It's doubtful that anyone will do a global conversion from memset() to
memzero_explicit(), as it's too hard to find all the places that should be
converted.  They are in lots of different subsystems; the crypto subsystem will
have the most, but not all.  We just need to fix as many as we can.  If you'd
like to do something more comprehensive than this patch, that would be great,
but I hope we don't wait forever for a global conversion that never happens.

FWIW, kfree_sensitive() (formerly kzfree) already got converted by
https://git.kernel.org/linus/8982ae527fbef170, and it wasn't really
controversial.  Some people even wanted Cc stable (which I disagreed with, but
it apparently made the final version).
