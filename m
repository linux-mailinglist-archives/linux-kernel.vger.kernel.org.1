Some remember me from low-jitter testing of Ubuntu Karmic Koala, where I 
got 72.7 fps on the 3-pass (72.7 x 3) engine of Doom 3, using among 
other things 91hz timer.

I further suggested a custom CPU for low jitter, making the single CPU 
probably the best choice for the home computer, with enhanced 
instruction set

A lot of DSP, are clear candidates, a 4pole filter (one input, one 
output), can be combined into a one clock operation aswell. JSR could 
take arguments. And ofcourse commonly used functions. (OISC, Optimized 
Instruction Set Computing.) Even larger things that has just plain 
inputs, and outputs. (Library functions) And this could even be done in 
parallel.

And ultimately an Exo kernel dropping context switches, with optimized 
modular generalized cpu-accelerated library parts.

That should be 1:1 the ultimate OS/Hardware combination!

Cheers,
Ywe CÃ¦rlyn.
