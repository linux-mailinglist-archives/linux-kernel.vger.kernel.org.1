Which version of the kernel is this based on?

This requirement should be added to the documentation. Is it necessary
or can this stub just figure out the address the same way as the other
32-bit entry points, using the scratch space in bootparams as a little
stack?

There are various fields in bootparams that depend on where the
kernel/initrd and cmdline are loaded in memory. If the entire bootparams
page is getting measured, does that mean they all have to be at fixed
addresses on every boot?

Also KEEP_SEGMENTS support is gone from the kernel since v5.7, since it
was unused. startup_32 now always loads a GDT and then the segment
registers. I think this should be ok for you as the only thing the flag
used to do in the 64-bit kernel was to stop startup_32 from blindly
loading __BOOT_DS into the segment registers before it had setup its own
GDT.

For the 32-bit assembler code that's being added, tip/master now has
changes that prevent the compressed kernel from having any runtime
relocations.  You'll need to revise some of the code and the data
structures initial values to avoid creating relocations.

Thanks.
