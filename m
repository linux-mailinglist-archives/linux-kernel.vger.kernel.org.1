Can you please put the version number properly in your subject?  It's
really hard to tell one version of your patch from another.

I'm still most definitely not an expert in how all the DRM pieces all
hook up together, but the solution you have in this patch seems wrong
to me.  As far as I can tell the "prepare" state isn't supposed to be
actually doing the suspend work and here that's exactly what you're
doing.  I think you should find a different solution to ensure
ordering is correct.
