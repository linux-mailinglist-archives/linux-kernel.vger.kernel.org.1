What would you think?

I guess if we have other types of data appended to the initrd
as similar to the bootconfig, I think we should add the multiple
section support. But only for the bootconfig, we can just update
the bootconfig data as I suggested, since it keeps the code simple.
It might be a chiken-egg problem...

Thank you,
