If they're all callbacks then it's overkill to add this. Presumably it
is better to enforce this wherever the callbacks are called from so as
to not litter the callee with random cant_sleep() calls. Probably best
to ignore my suggestion.

If I read it correctly Will is saying the same thing in that thread.
