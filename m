Yes, there is nothing PMD specific here and we would use the same statistics
for non-PMD size THP migration (if any) as well. But is THP migration really
supported for non-PMD sizes ? CONFIG_ARCH_ENABLE_THP_MIGRATION depends upon
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE without being specific or denying about possible
PUD level support. Fair enough, will drop the PMD from the events and their
functions.
