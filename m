The NULL pointer deference was found even without this patch.
This patch would just cause that it will manifest itself on another
place. What is the benefit, please?

I see few drawbacks with this patch:

1. It will cause adding much more messages into the logbuffer even
   though they are not flushed to the console. It might cause that
   more important messages will get overridden before they reach
   console. They might also make hard to read the full log.

2. Crash inside printk() causes recursive messages. They are currently
   printed into the printk_safe() buffers and there is a bigger risk
   that they will not reach the console.

3. pr_debug() messages are not printed by default. It is possible that
   nobody used them for ages. You might get many errors in less
   maintained code instead in the really used one. I mean that you
   will get more noise with less gain.



Have you tested this patch by the syzcaller with many runs, please?
Did it helped to actually discover more bugs?
Did it really made things easier?

I am not able to judge usefulness without more data. My intuition
tells me that we should keep the number of syzcaller-related twists
as small as possible. Otherwise, syscaller will diverge more and
more from reality.

Best Regards,
Petr
