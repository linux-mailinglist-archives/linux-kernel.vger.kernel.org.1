Hi Leo,

FWIW, I'm /really/ struggling to understand the problem here.

If I've grokked it correctly (big 'if'), then you can't just factor in
what you call "time_offset" in the diagram above, because there isn't
a guarantee that the counter is zero-initialised at the start.

Hmm, reading the counter and calculating the delta feels horribly
approximate to me. It would be much better if we could get hold of the
initial epoch cycles from the point at which sched_clock was initialised
using the counter. This represents the true cycle delta between the counter
and what sched_clock uses for 0 ns.

Unfortunately, I can't see a straightforward way to grab that information.
It looks like x86 pulls this directly from the TSC driver.
