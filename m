Yeah, if it's actual state you put in there. But this dc_state structure
is more like a container of state pointers, like drm_atomic_state. It's
not 100% clear-cut, e.g. the bw stuff is more like a real state object I
guess, or maybe it's just temporary storage for computation results?

So on the stream bundles ... where do these pointers point to? Are the
streams themselves in the crtc/plane states?

Uh, is your hw that good, i.e. there's no impossible state transitions? Or
do you simply force a modeset in such cases? In which case, are the
modeset flags correctly updated so that userspace can control this with
ALLOW_MODESET?

Uh this is awkward, holding up upstream because of downstream kernels ...

Can't you fix this with a lot more glue in the downstream kernels, stuff
like copying the entire atomic helpers into your driver when there's new
stuff?

For the multi-pipe stuff, how other drivers handle this is by internally
remapping userspace visible crtc/plane objects to underlying hw objects.
And then if you have remapping going on you add the userspace state
structs for all underlying remmapped crtc/plane in use by the current
update. That should be enough to force just enough synchronization.

Then in your hw commit functions you simple iterate over all the states in
your update, as if you'd iterate over streams directly. So example:

struct amdgpu_crtc_state {
	struct drm_crtc_state base;
	struct dm_stream_mapping_state mapping;
	/* this crtc might not be using this stream! */
	struct dm_stream_state stream;
};

I think msm works like this, but there's also other drivers.

When you have to change the mapping then you grab the global mapping
private state, but in any other cases you use the read-only copy in the
crtc state. And the global state is only for book-keeping, so no sync
needed (aside from the sync provided by adding the crtc states for each
stream you touch).

Ofc might have gotten the stream lingo wrong, but this is roughly how to
do this in atomic.

Yeah don't do that :-) It might work if you guarantee that the atomic
commit_tail is waiting for all your irq handlers to complete, plus use rcu
dereferencing on these pointers.

Copying the relevant bits over should be much nicer imo, also passing
explicit pointers at least. I.e. if you don't want to copy, have a
dedicated pointer protected by irqsave spin_lock that you share with the
interrupt handler. Stopping interrupt handlers before swap_state isn't
really how this should work.

Yup. I think you can have some pointers to specific state, _iff_ you make
sure the commit_tail waits for all the interrupt handlers to complete
somewhere (depending upon how this all works). But copying is probably
simpler to understand - interrupt races are tricky.
