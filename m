Hi James,

Thank you very much for your thorough response. I do have a lot to
digest from it but would like to at least respond promptly to a question
you included ...

This is the one I referred to and a significant change.

Right, controlled with the mount option but the behavior is being
changed to apply to both L2 and L3, even if user requests just one of
the two.

Please note that in the documentation it is currently explicitly stated
that: "L2 and L3 CDP are controlled separately"

Things are not as clear cut unfortunately. There is a new Atom system
that has a server uncore, thus inheriting some RDT features that have
previously only been seen on servers. L2 CAT/CDP is also moving to
servers in future server products.

You can find more details about RDT features in upcoming systems in
Chapter 9 of
https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/c5/15/architecture-instruction-set-extensions-programming-reference.pdf

The odd/even is just for the CDP enabled resource, not global. It is
thus possible for, for example, the L3, L2CODE, and L2DATA resources to
be enabled. The odd/even is configured by the multiplier cbm_idx_mult
set in the resource configuration and used in cbm_idx(). Perhaps you
mean the CLOSID is global? By enabling these together it would reduce
the number of CLOSIDs that could be used by L3 in this example.

Yes, there are systems that support L2 CAT/CDP and L3 CAT/CDP. CDP is
controlled separately on the different cache levels.

Thank you for stating this. This is significant and was not clear to me
initially.
