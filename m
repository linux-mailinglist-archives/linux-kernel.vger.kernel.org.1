ah, right, good to fail early in that case then.

Not sure whether we'd like to prevent the option from being selectable
in that case, or just to silently not compress the debug info.  Given
that the compression is an optimization, it doesn't hurt to silently
not do it, but it would be nice to notify the user their toolchain may
have been misconfigured.  Though another part of me feels "garbage in,
garbage out."

^ Those 2 last sentences should go in the commit message, as the
current form doesn't allude to that.

Yep. Got it.

I verified that Clang will still produce compressed debug info
sections for .s/.S input with -gz=zlib.  So this doesn't regress
anything, AFAICT.

Thanks for the patch.
