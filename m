This regression only happened on the testbox "lkp-hsw-4ex1", the machine 
hardware info:
model: Haswell-EX
nr_node: 4
nr_cpu: 144
memory: 512G
brand: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-8890 v3 @ 2.50GHz

We have ever reproduced it for many times, but recently we upgrade both 
software and hardware for it, then we can not reproduce the regression 
on it, we also try to revert the upgrade, it still can not be 
reproduced. We will continue to run the test case and once the 
regression reproduced will let you know.
