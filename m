Yeah. I figure it might just look cleaner? Or, I guess, drop the other
macros? I guess I wasn't sure why those macros got touched and then
didn't get used.

Hmm. I wonder if there might be a way to carve out what you need into
lib/ and then #include it as a separate compilation unit? I'm always
worried about cut/pasted code getting out of sync.

Hm, I see. I guess if this becomes fragile in the future, the special
inlines can be moved to lib/extable.h and then things can be carved out
into a separate compilation unit.

Yeah, I got myself confused there originally. I actuallyed realized my
mistake on this later when I was explaining how FGKASLR worked in the
thread with tglx. :)

Cool; yeah, it was just a "wait, is that right?" when looking at it.

I think it's fine to split it out with a commit log describing what it's
_about_ to fix, "without this, any other code using misc.h ..." and/or
"in the next patches we'll need this because ..."

The code style in the kernel seems to be to not include these (since
it's a call-site override) and instead use __must_check on the function
when the results MUST be checked. This way, all call-sites suddenly
light up when the attribute gets added and we don't end up with places
that might get masked, etc.
