Yes, we agree.  I am just suggesting that you call this out in the
commit log.  It is probably not obvious to those who have not been
through the code yet.  ;-)

True enough.  I am just suggesting that an equally small refactor in
a slightly different direction should get to a better place.  The key
point enabling this slightly different direction is that this code is
an exception to the "preserve ->cblist.len" rule because it is invoked
only from the CPU hotplug code.

So you could use the rcu_cblist .len field to update the ->cblist.len
field, thus combining the _cbs and _count updates.  One thing that helps
is that setting th e rcu_cblist .len field doesn't hurt the other use
cases that require careful handling of ->cblist.len.
