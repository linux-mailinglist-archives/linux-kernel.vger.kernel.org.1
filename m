Actually, that's not the point.  Normally, I get all the reports on this
case, and then I forward them if they look ok.  If I forwarded something
incorrect, then sorry about that.  If the policy has changed for this rule
to be sending the reports out directlty to the recipients, then I think it
should be changed back.  There are a lot of real bugs with lock usage, but
there are alot of false positives too.  Specifically, the rule looks for
the case with identical if tests, but only when the branches are identical
too.

Kbuild people, can this be adjusted?  Or have I misunderstood the
situation?

thanks,
julia
