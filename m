That will be an interesting philosophical argument for Linux moving
forward.  I've often stated that there is going to be a natural
political tension between the objectives of open-source and advances
in platform security.  By definition, advancing the latter will result
in technology that contrains what can be done with a platform.

It may have made more sense for the SGX driver to be mainline when the
technology was going to be ubiquitous.  Given the decision by Intel to
monetize the platform, by limiting its implementation to high end
server platforms, the case could be made that it is a driver best
supported by the distributions or cloud providers.

I'm neither for or against inclusion, I'm simply advocating that we
make informed decisions on the driver implementation that benefits the
user community.  FWIW, based on knowledge that has come from building
application stacks on top of the technology for a half decade now.

Have a good weekend.
