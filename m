Hi,

The discussion died and the patch was not applied :) In general
IDK how worthwhile it is to use standard LED names for them. I
suppose the number of people planning to create something like
OpenWRT for medical devices is not so big.

I understand.

I see you point, but wonder if mute is the right choice. The LED
signals a silenced alarm, which IMHO is not the same:

* The alarm silencing is temporary and system unsilences after
  1-2 minutes.
* LED is usually blinking instead of solid like a laptop mute LED
  (so that operator is aware of silenced alarm)
* Device usually cannot be put into silenced mode before the alarm
  appears
* Some medical devices still generate perodic beeps

AFAIK this is named alarm silencing by basically everyone for
medical devices. So I think naming this platfrom:*:mute would
increase the mess.
