I don=E2=80=99t like this at all. Your behavior really shouldn=E2=80=99t de=
pend on
whether the new instructions are available.  Also, some day I would
like to change Linux to have the new behavior even if FSGSBASE
instructions are not available, and this will break rr again.  (The
current !FSGSBASE behavior is an ugly optimization of dubious value.
I would not go so far as to describe it as correct.)

I would suggest you do one of the following things:

1. Use int $0x80 directly to load 32-bit regs into a child.  This
might dramatically simplify your code and should just do the right
thing.

2. Something like your patch but make it unconditional.

3. Ask for, and receive, real kernel support for setting FS and GS in
the way that 32-bit code expects.

Also, for other x86 kernel folks playing along, WTF is
task_user_regset_vew() about?  It has eight callers, in two groups,
and as far as I can tell every single call returns &user_x86_64_view
because it's only called in the 64-bit and x32 syscall paths, and
those are only reachable using the 64-bit SYSCALL instruction.  I
suppose the exception is if someone ptraces the ptracer and changes CS
at syscall entry.  In any case, if task_user_regset_view() ever
returns anything else, the code will malfunction.  I'll send a patch
to get rid of it.
