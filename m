Ah, yeah. Thanks for noticing. I had some troubles with dtbs_check, so
I ended commenting out some things for testing purposes. I'll remove the
comments and check if this was already solved with the current schema.

I guess I can do the rename to a different patch - or maybe even better - drop
this regulator on this series and re-add with a different name on
some other patch.

The thing is that this regulator is currently used by the SDIO device
drivers. That's the reason why it starts with "sd_". 

However, at the real hardware, there are 3 different regulator outputs 
for SDIO related stuff. Such change is inside this patchset.

However, there is the need of a 1v8 fixed power line used on another 
upcoming driver. I guess I was too lazy to keep the DT info here ;-)

This is actually on an independent patch:

	https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/176043f329dfa9889f014feec04e7e1553077873.1597160086.git.mchehab+huawei@kernel.org/T/#m1864011fa82154c6aa27fd4b2e9fce396bb3cd33

I guess I'll just submit this specific one outside this series.

What do you mean? Makefile should be using it:

	$ git grep MFD_HI6421_SPMI
	drivers/mfd/Kconfig:config MFD_HI6421_SPMI
	drivers/mfd/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_MFD_HI6421_SPMI)      += hi6421-spmi-pmic.o

Ok! I was in doubt about that, as there are a few other drivers with
the same pattern:

	drivers/ata/sata_dwc_460ex.c:#define NO_IRQ             0
	drivers/input/touchscreen/ucb1400_ts.c:#define NO_IRQ   0
	drivers/mmc/host/of_mmc_spi.c:#define NO_IRQ 0
	drivers/pcmcia/pd6729.c:#define NO_IRQ  ((unsigned int)(0))
	drivers/rtc/rtc-m48t59.c:#define NO_IRQ (-1)

Btw, this definition at the rtc driver sounds weird ;-)

I'll change the driver to use "int" and return proper error codes on errors.

Yep. I'll drop the obvious ones.

Good point. I'll fix it.

My guess is that this is decided by the board manufacturer. I mean,
from the schematics:

	https://www.96boards.org/documentation/consumer/hikey/hikey970/hardware-docs/files/hikey970-schematics.pdf

This is a separate chipset, connected at the Kirin 970 SPMI bus. The SPMI bus
allows up to 16 PMICs. So, I would assume that a chip designed to support
SPMI would have the flexibility of using different IRQ lines, being
programmable either via some firmware or via some wiring.

Without knowing more, IMO the best would be to keep those settings
at DT.

I'll remove the casting. Btw, I guess I'll even replace it by
a single number instead of an array, as the second value
is already at the "irq-array" DT property:

			irq-num = <16>;
			irq-array = <2>;
			irq-mask-addr = <0x202 2>;
			irq-addr = <0x212 2>;

The arrays for irq-mask-addr and irq-addr are:

	struct hi6421_spmi_irq_mask_info {
		int start_addr;
		int array;
	};

	struct hi6421_spmi_irq_info {
		int start_addr;
		int array;
	};

At the code, sometimes it uses irq_mask->array, while on others it
use irqarray, apparently for the same goal. So, it sounds safe to get
rid of the duplication there. I'll place this on a separate patch,
as I might have been missing something.

Yeah, from what I saw, the GPIOs supported right now by this driver
are just for IRQs.

Actually, it is just the opposite. It took me a lot of time to
figure out a good solution that will prevent all race conditions at
probe time.

See, the SPMI variant of HiSilicon 6421 requires the drivers to be
probed on a very specific order:

- The SPMI controller should be loaded first, as it provides 
  the low-level I/O access to the serial bus used to talk with the
  PMICs. This bus is somewhat similar to the I2C bus.

  Once the controller is registered, the SPMI bus probes the PMIC
  driver.

- Then, the MFD PMIC driver should be loaded. This adds support for
  a high level set of I/O operations, which are used by the regulator
  driver. Again, this approach is similar to the one taken by the
  I2C Kernel drivers.

- Finally, the regulator drivers should come, as they rely on the
  MFD I/O operations in order to talk with the SPMI bus.

The OOT driver probing was based on a some dirty hacks: it had an
empty SPMI entry at the SoC, carrying on just the "compatible" line.

Then, another entry at DT with the real SPMI settings.

With such dirty hack, on Kernel 4.9, the PMIC driver were always 
loading before the regulator ones, as the SPMI bus code were 
serializing the probe there.

However, such settings were too fragile and broke after porting to
upstream Kernels, because the regulator drivers were probed on
a random order, typically before the MFD one (and sometimes even 
before the SPMI controller driver). Adding EPROBE_DEFER didn't
solve all the issues, and made a complex and hard to debug scenario.
Also, regulators were probed on a random order, making harder to
debug issues there.

So, I ended using the same solution used by the already-existing
drivers/mfd/hi6421-pmic-core.c driver[1].

[1] This variant of the 6421 chipset is a lot simpler, as it
    doesn't use the SPMI bus.

With such approach, the probing is warranted to happen the
way it is expected by the driver:

SPMI controller code starts:
	[    0.416862] spmi_controller fff24000.spmi: HISI SPMI probe
	[    0.422419] spmi spmi-0: allocated controller 0x(____ptrval____) id 0
	[    0.428929] spmi_controller fff24000.spmi: spmi_add_controller base addr=0xffff800012055000!
	[    0.437480] spmi spmi-0: adding child /spmi@fff24000/pmic@0
	[    0.443109] spmi spmi-0: read usid 00
	[    0.446821] spmi 2-00: device 2-00 registered
	[    0.451220] spmi spmi-0: spmi-2 registered: dev:(____ptrval____)
	[    0.457286] spmi_controller fff24000.spmi: spmi_add_controller initialized

The PMIC probe happens sometime after spmi_controller registers itself
at the SPMI bus:

	[    1.955838] [hi6421_spmi_pmic_probe]. pmic->irqs[0] = 43
...
	[    2.036298] [hi6421_spmi_pmic_probe]. pmic->irqs[15] = 58

After being ready to handle I/O requests, it starts probing the
regulators:

	[    2.057815] hi6421v600-regulator hi6421v600-regulator: adding child /spmi@fff24000/pmic@0/regulators/ldo3@16

As the current code serializes the regulator probing, it ensured that
they'll happen at the right order, avoiding race conditions at
probe time.

Yeah, we can get rid of devm_kfree().

Neither REGULATOR_HI6421V600 nor MFD_HI6421_PMIC depends on ARM or
ARM64, so they should build fine on any arch. So, I'm failing to see
why adding COMPILE_TEST would make any difference.

That was my first approach: to drop any existing printk macro, replacing
them by dev_dbg(). However, with dev_dbg(), the logs were like:

[    2.069301] platform ldo3: LDO doesn't support economy mode.
[    2.074969] platform ldo3: voltage selector settings: reg: 0x51, mask: 0xf

[    2.153484] regulator.3: hi6421_spmi_regulator_get_voltage_sel: vsel_reg=0x51, value=0x8, entry=0x8, voltage=1800 mV

[    2.191289] regulator.3: hi6421_spmi_regulator_probe_ldo: valid_modes_mask: 0x2, valid_ops_mask: 0x9

E. g. the messages printed by the regulator's core were using 
(rdev)->desc->name on their printks, producing a nice debug
(when enabled at core level), while dev_dbg() were using a different name.

In this specific case, one might assume that "regulator.3" is "ldo3",
but this is by coincidence, as it actually matches the sysfs entries:

	$ ls -l /sys/class/regulator/
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 ago 12 08:26 regulator.0 -> ../../devices/platform/reg-dummy/regulator/regulator.0
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 ago 12 08:26 regulator.1 -> ../../devices/platform/regulator-1v8/regulator/regulator.1

	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 ago 12 08:26 regulator.5 -> ../../devices/platform/spmi-0/2-00/ldo9/regulator/regulator.5
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 ago 12 08:26 regulator.6 -> ../../devices/platform/spmi-0/2-00/ldo15/regulator/regulator.6
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 ago 12 08:26 regulator.7 -> ../../devices/platform/spmi-0/2-00/ldo16/regulator/regulator.7
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 ago 12 08:26 regulator.8 -> ../../devices/platform/spmi-0/2-00/ldo17/regulator/regulator.8
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 ago 12 08:26 regulator.9 -> ../../devices/platform/spmi-0/2-00/ldo33/regulator/regulator.9

When playing with DT, the "regulator.[\d+]" namespace may change,
making harder to debug stuff. So, basically, enabling just the logs
at the regulator driver were requiring to double-check the sysfs 
entries in order to see what "regulator.3" were actually meaning
with a particular DT setting.

After adding the macro, the output is a lot easier to be understood:

[    2.069301] platform ldo3: LDO doesn't support economy mode.
[    2.074969] platform ldo3: voltage selector settings: reg: 0x51, mask: 0xf

[    2.105530] ldo3: hi6421_spmi_regulator_enable: off_on_delay=20000 us, enable_reg=0x16, enable_mask=0x1
[    2.153484] ldo3: hi6421_spmi_regulator_get_voltage_sel: vsel_reg=0x51, value=0x8, entry=0x8, voltage=1800 mV
[    2.163409] ldo3: 1500 <--> 2000 mV at 1800 mV normal 
[    2.181305] ldo3: hi6421_spmi_regulator_get_voltage_sel: vsel_reg=0x51, value=0x8, entry=0x8, voltage=1800 mV
[    2.191289] ldo3: hi6421_spmi_regulator_probe_ldo: valid_modes_mask: 0x2, valid_ops_mask: 0x9

As the name which got printed is the one that actually makes sense
for someone working with the driver, as it matches the DT entries
and the hardware power supply lines.

Good question. I almost removed this check, but I didn't check the
regulator code with enough care to be 100% sure. So, I opted to keep it
here.

I actually used this debug. There are some LDO lines which don't
support eco mode. The original driver was hard to understand that.
So, I ended by re-writing the part of the code which sets/uses it[1]:

+	/* hisi regulator supports two modes */
+	constraint = &initdata->constraints;
+
+	constraint->valid_modes_mask = REGULATOR_MODE_NORMAL;
+	if (sreg->eco_mode_mask) {
+		constraint->valid_modes_mask |= REGULATOR_MODE_IDLE;
+		constraint->valid_ops_mask |= REGULATOR_CHANGE_MODE;
+	}
+

Those debug messages are useful to double-check if something bad is
not happening with the modes/ops masks.

I guess we can. I'll check and change if ok.

Yeah, agreed. I'll cleanup useless comments on this driver.

I guess we can just get rid of both, converting sreg to use devm alloc.

Btw, at least on Hikey 970 (which happens to be the only board using
it so far), in practice this driver should never be removed, as, among 
other things, it controls the power supply for storage (both SD and
MMC).

Yeah, I also have a vage remind about HAS_IOMEM and stubs at the headers
(or some other config option similar to it), but not really sure.

There is just another SPMI driver. So, I ended playing safe here by
duplicating select/depends on from the previous entry. Btw,
there are several other places with the same pattern.

Yeah, I guess this can now be dropped. That was required while
fixing some endianness issues at the past code.

That's helpful to check if drivers initialized at the right order.

I'll change it to dev_dbg().
