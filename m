Subject: [PATCH v3] hwmon: (drivetemp) Avoid SCT usage on Toshiba DT01ACA family drives
Date:   Sat, 18 Jul 2020 14:32:10 +0200

It has been observed that Toshiba DT01ACA family drives have
WRITE FPDMA QUEUED command timeouts and sometimes just freeze until
power-cycled under heavy write loads when their temperature is getting
polled in SCT mode. The SMART mode seems to be fine, though.

Let's make sure we don't use SCT mode for these drives then.

While only the 3 TB model was actually caught exhibiting the problem let's
play safe here to avoid data corruption and extend the ban to the whole
family.

Notes:
    This behavior was observed on two different DT01ACA3 drives.
    
    Usually, a series of queued WRITE FPDMA QUEUED commands just time out,
    but sometimes the whole drive freezes. Merely disconnecting and
    reconnecting SATA interface cable then does not unfreeze the drive.
    
    One has to disconnect and reconnect the drive power connector for the
    drive to be detected again (suggesting the drive firmware itself has
    crashed).
    
    This only happens when the drive temperature is polled very often (like
    every second), so occasional SCT usage via smartmontools is probably
    safe.
    
    Changes from v1:
    'SCT blacklist' -> 'SCT avoid models'
    
    Changes from v2:
    * Switch to prefix matching and use it to match the DT01ACAx family,
    
    * Use "!" instead of "== 0",
    
    * Add a comment about the contents of the "model" field.
