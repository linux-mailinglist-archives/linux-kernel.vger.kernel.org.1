I mean this pattern:

device_a_data {
	.thing = this;
}

device_b_data {
	.thing = this;
}

device_c_data {
	.thing = that;
}

match[] = {
	{ .compatible = "A", .data = &device_a_data },
	{ .compatible = "B", .data = &device_b_data },
	{ .compatible = "C", .data = &device_c_data },
};

...vs. this pattern:

do_this {
	.thing = this;
}

do_that {
	.thing = that;
}

match[] = {
	{ .compatible = "A", .data = &do_this },
	{ .compatible = "B", .data = &do_this },
	{ .compatible = "C", .data = &do_that },
};

 From the perspective of the thing doing the thing, grouping the data by 
device is meaningless if all that matters is whether to do this or that. 
The second pattern expresses that more naturally.

Of course if every device turns out to need a unique combination of 
several behaviours, then there ends up being no practical difference 
except that it's probably easier to come up with nice names under the 
first pattern. I guess it's up to how you see this developing in future; 
whether you're likely to need fine-grained per-device control, or don't 
expect it to go much beyond domain type.

Robin.
