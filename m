Kind of yes.

OK, so I'll throw something.

1. "normal" is either exception from either EENTER or ERESUME,
   or just EEXIT.
2. "interrupt" is something where you want to tailor AEP path.

I think that's quite intuitive to have just one state variable.

What I'd do would be to add a 'flags' field.

It could have a bit for interrupt, let's call it for the sake of an
example as SGX_ENCLAVE_RUN_FLAG_INT.

Then you'd do this if you want to exit from the vDSO instead of doing
ERESUME:

	run->flags |= SGX_ENCLAVE_RUN_FLAG_INT

The vDSO would check this bit on AEP and:

1. If it's cleared, it would ERESUME.
2. If it's set, it would clear it and exit from vDSO.

I don't care as much as saving bytes as defining API, which has zero
ambiguous state variables.

And since the field 'leaf' is there, and was before too, no degrees of
freedom are lost. Removing one variable does not make more of a mess.
