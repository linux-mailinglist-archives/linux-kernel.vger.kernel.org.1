But there should be an upper bound upon the total amount of in-flight
GFP_ATOMIC memory at any point in time?  These aren't like pagecache
which will take more if we give it more.  Setting the various
thresholds appropriately should ensure that blockable allocations don't
get their memory stolen by GPP_ATOMIC allocations?

I took a look at doing a quick-fix for the
direct-reclaimers-get-their-stuff-stolen issue about a million years
ago.  I don't recall where it ended up.  It's pretty trivial for the
direct reclaimer to free pages into current->reclaimed_pages and to
take a look in there on the allocation path, etc.  But it's only
practical for order-0 pages.
