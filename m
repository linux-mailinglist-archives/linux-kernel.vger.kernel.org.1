FWIW, the address is inside a sigframe we decided to build, so noncanonical
addresses shouldn't occur in practice.

I'm not sure it's the right solution in this case.  Look at the call chain
and the stuff done nearby (that __clear_user(), for example)...

I'm not saying that this code is not awful - it certainly is.  But it's
not that simple, unfortunately ;-/
