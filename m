Do we need to support SMCCC without PSCI? Is anyone goingto build a
sysyem with SMCCC but no PSCI functionality?

If not, then given we can always probe SMCCC from PSCI (for both ACPI
and DT), I'd prefer to support only support doing things that way
around. i.e. have SMCCC depend on PSCI.

Otherwise I suspect we're inviting more problems than a dependency on
PSCI.

Thanks,
Mark.
