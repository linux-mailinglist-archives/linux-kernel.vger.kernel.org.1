I would expect this is absolutely not wanted,
it would make testing recent kernels very hard.

If you want to keep a tool that tightly to the kernel,
please bundle it with the kernel and build it as part
of the kernel build.

I would suggest to start with a proper design/specification what the 
kernel wants to use, so that you are confident that a compiler 
implementing this will be sufficient for the next 5 years.

As a secondary benefit, starting with a proper design often brings
a better result than adding permanent features piece by piece.

As a tertiary benefit, it would avoid tying the kernel to one specific 
compiler implementation. A compiler like mrustc or a hypothetical Rust 
frontend for gcc could then implement a superset of what the kernel 
needs.

The main difference is between an alternative to an existing tool,
and a mandatory new tool.

The correct range for a mandatory tool are the 6 to 12 years for gcc.

Debian stable and Ubuntu LTS are providing (different) mechanisms
for installing the kernel from the next stable/LTS release 2 years
later[1] for supporting new hardware.
If kernel 5.12 LTS cannot be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with
the 2019 gcc 9 there would be pain downstream.

In the embedded world spreads far wider than these 3 years are common.
I would currently have a real-life usecase for compiling a recent
kernel with a gcc 4.0 (sic) toolchain.
Properly supporting 15 year old toolchains would be painful upstream,
supporting 6 year old toolchains is a reasonable compromise between
not being too painful upstream while rarely causing pain downstream.

What applies to gcc does also apply to other external tools used
during the kernel build.
