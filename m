All these above will be a change in the existing user visible behavior on
the system and this patch never intended to create one. Hence, I will just
defer this to maintainers on whether we should change existing /proc/cpuinfo
output (including non-practically-possible ones on ARMv8) or even treat swap
emulation as SWP.

But IMHO, in case we decide to go for a /proc/cpuinfo change (which I would
be happy implement), it should be applied over and above this patch which
just preserved existing semantics and behavior.
