Thanks for your work.
There is no progress on the issue for long time, so i sent my solution in v8 comments
and sent v9 recently.

I think direct limiting the crashkernel in ZONE_DMA isn't a good idea:
1. For parameter "crashkernel=Y", reserving crashkernel in first 1G memory will increase
the probability of memory allocation failure.
Previous discuss from https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/10/21/725:
    "With ZONE_DMA=y, this config will fail to reserve 512M CMA on a server"

2. For parameter "crashkernel=Y@X", limiting the crashkernel in ZONE_DMA is unreasonable
for someone really want to reserve crashkernel from specified start address.

I have sent v10: https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg819408.html, any commets are welcome.

Thanks,
Chen Zhou
