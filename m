By having a config option that forces it on if that option is selected
by modular irqchips? More importantly, what is the drawback of having
fw_devlink on at all times? It definitely looks like the best thing
since sliced bread (with cheese), so what is the catch?

That would have my preference, provided that there is no drawbacks.

That'd be a lot better. We also need some guards for things that
cannot be a driver (primary interrupt controllers don't have a struct
device).

Thanks,
