=3D=3D task struck leaks =3D=3D
There are leaks from task struct from time to time where someone forgot =
to call put_task_struct() somewhere leading to leaks. For example,

=
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/C1CCBDAC-A453-4FF2-908F-0B6E356223D1@lca.pw/

It was such a pain to debug this kind of leaks at the moment, as all we =
could do was to audit the code by checking all new put_task_struct()  =
and get_task_struct() call sites which is error-prone because there =
could be other new call sites like get_pid_task() which would also need =
to be balanced with put_task_struct() as well.

What do you think about adding some aux call traces for kmemleak in =
general? For example, if the tracking object is a task struct, it would =
save call traces for the first and last call of both get_task_struct() =
and put_task_struct(). Then, it could be expanded to track other =
refcount-based leaks in the future.

=3D=3D call_rcu() leaks =3D=3D
Another issue that might be relevant is that it seems sometimes, =
kmemleak will give a lot of false positives (hundreds) because the =
memory was supposed to be freed by call_rcu()  (for example, in =
dst_release()) but for some reasons, it takes a long time probably =
waiting for grace periods or some kind of RCU self-stall, but the memory =
had already became an orphan. I am not sure how we are going to resolve =
this properly until we have to figure out why call_rcu() is taking so =
long to finish?

Another solution is to add aux call traces for both skb_dst_drop() and =
skb_dst_set() for this case, but that there are many places to free =
memory via call_rcu() like inode free etc.=
