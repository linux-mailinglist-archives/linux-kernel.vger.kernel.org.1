OK, I didn't look at the series yet but I'm wondering: How are you using
jbd2 debugging? I mean obviously it isn't meant for production use but
rather for debugging JBD2 bugs so I'm kind of wondering in which case too
many messages matter.

And if the problem is that there's a problem with distinguishing messages
from multiple filesystems, then it would be perhaps more useful to add
journal identification to each message similarly as we do it with ext4
messages (likely by using journal->j_dev) - which is very simple to do
after your patches 3 and 4.
