What about using KERN_INFO then? Is there still the same problem?

Otherwise this looks like a dead end. The above states that
administrators will not have to do anything when KERN_NO_CONSOLES
are introduced. But there are people that will not like the new
behavior. They will have to do something.

The problem with LOGLEVEL_SCHED is that it is not reliable. It must be
used for all printk() calls in the critical path. But people are not
aware of this, or they forget, or it gets complicated in shared code.

KERN_NO_CONSOLES will have exactly the same problems.

KERN_CONT is not reliable also from other reasons.

Exactly and people are aware of it. We should use it when possible
instead of introducing yet another complexity.
