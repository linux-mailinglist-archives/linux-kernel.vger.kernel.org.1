Let's suppose that this change is made, and further that in a year or
two the "if" statement below is replaced with its "else" block.

Now let's suppose that (some years after that) a hard-to-trigger bug
makes its way into RCU's CPU-hotplug code that would have resulted in
the WARN_ON_ONCE() triggering, but that this bug turns out to be not so
hard to trigger in certain large production environments.

Let's suppose further that you have moved on to where you are responsible
for one of these large production environments.  How would this
hypothetical RCU/CPU-hotplug bug manifest?
