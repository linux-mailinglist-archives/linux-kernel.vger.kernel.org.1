Small systems might have ~64G.  The medium-sized systems might have
~250G.  There are a few big ones that might have 1.5T.  None of the
/proc/vmstat files from those machines contain anything resembling
the list below, though.

It needs to be almost entirely per-CPU for performance reasons.  Plus
a user could do a tight close(open()) loop on each CPU.

So the really ugly scenarios with the tight loops normally allocate
something and immediately either call_rcu() or kfree_rcu() it.
But you are right, someone doing "rm -rf" on a large file tree
with lots of small files might not be doing that many allocations.

Not yet, but let's see what we can do.
