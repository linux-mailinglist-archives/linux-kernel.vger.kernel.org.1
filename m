I classified that as a nit really and doesn't affect correctness. We have
different subjective view on what is better here. I did all the work in the
past 2 weeks and I think as the author of this patch I have the right to keep
my preference on subjective matters. I did consider your feedback and didn't
ignore it and improved the naming and added a comment to make sure there's no
confusion.

We could nitpick the best name forever, but is it really that important?

I really don't see any added value for one approach or another here to start
a long debate about it.

The comments were small enough that I didn't see any controversy that
warrants holding the patches longer. I agreed with your proposal to use
uc_se->active and clarified why your other suggestions don't hold.

You pointed that uclamp_is_enabled() confused you; and I responded that I'll
change the name. Sorry for not being explicit about answering the below, but
I thought my answer implied that I don't prefer it.

I am sorry there's no written rule that says one should do it in a specific
way. And AFAIK both way are implemented in the kernel. I appreciate your
suggestion but as the person who did all the hard work, I think my preference
matters here too.

And actually with my approach when uclamp is not compiled in there's no need to
define an extra variable; and since uclamp_is_used() is defined as false for
!CONFIG_UCLAMP_TASK, it'll help with DCE, so less likely to end up with dead
code that'll never run in the final binary.

Thanks a lot for all of your comments and feedback anyway!
