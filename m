An alternative solution to to placing in a migratepage callback is to 
actually remove the buffer heads from an LRU list in drop_buffers() - we 
tried upstreaming such a patch some time ago: 
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/325406/ .  This would solve the 
problem, and would avoid having to get a migratepage callback for any 
other files systems that have aops without the callback.  This didn't 
get off the ground however, I'm picking up the line of questioning left 
in the previous thread, to determine why EXT4 doesn't have a migratepage 
callback.

Thanks,

Chris.
