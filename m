So the params should certainly be 0-indexed, but I think TAP starts
counting at 1, so maybe this should be:

    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 1 - param-0

and so on... ?

Right now it doesn't matter, but it will if we make these subsubtests
as David suggested.

Yes that looks right, but see the comment above ^
