Hi,

I did some more investigating and testing for this bug, and turns out I was very
wrong. I'm truly sorry for that.

The memory leak that is caused is caused when !hu->serdev itself, since we free
h5, but not h5->rx_skb. This is what causes the memory leak.

I'll send in a v3 that corrects this issue soon enough, by freeing h5->rx_skb first
followed by h5 when !hu->serdev; and otherwise (when hu->serdev exists)
calling h5_reset_rx().

Sorry for the trouble.

Thanks,
Anant
