By "configuration" do you mean "kernel configuration"?  What is wrong
with relying on the build option like we do today?

You might want to reword all of this to make more sense about the
"problem" you are trying to solve here, as I don't really understand it,
sorry.

No documentation update?  That's not good :(

But you are not restricting the ability to mount it here, you are
removing the ability for it to even start up at all.  What does this
break for code that thinks the filesystem is registered (i.e. the call
to simple_pin_fs() in start_creating() in fs/debugfs/inode.c?

No hint as to what the command line option is?  And again, it's not a
restriction for mounting it, you are preventing it from initializing
entirely.

Which, as I have found out over time, can had side affects for codepaths
that try to check the return value of debugfs calls, and if they fail to
succeed, abort the whole driver/subsystem/whatever initializaion path,
which is not what I think you want to do here at all.
