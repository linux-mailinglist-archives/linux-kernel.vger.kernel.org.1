I think we are in agreement and have a common interest here.

I wonder if you are conflating Graphene with SGX?  I understand that 
many cloud vendors are offering SGX in preview/GA, but there are other 
frameworks to build these offerings on, such as Intel's SGX SDK or 
Haven.  It would be news to me if every major cloud vendor were putting 
Graphene in production.
