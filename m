Maybe, I initially considered this for mixed criticality, where the
'soft' class would run EDF and the 'hard' class would run LLF (or the
other way around, I can't quite remember how I figured it).

If you restrict the hard class to single CPU assignment (IOW the UP
case) and ensure that u_llf + U_gedf/N < 1, it should just work out.

But I shelved all that after I heard about that other balancer idea
Danial was suppose to be working on ;-)))

/me consults notes, EDZL is I think the closest thing there.

That would certainly be sufficient for OTHER servers I think.
