I don't see any obvious reason why *_expedited could not be used here,
as most of the time sync's are taken care of sgx_release() loop, and the
final sync is with sgx_mmu_notifier_release(). More aggressive spinning
should not do any harm here.

About the tags. I just try to get them right, and it is sometimes not
straight-forward. So I guess, with all things considered, I'll put
suggested-by from you. Once I get a refined patch out, try it out with
your workloads and provide me tested-by, if it is working for you.
