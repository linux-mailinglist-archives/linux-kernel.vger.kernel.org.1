Completely agreed! The in kernel OOM killer is to deal with situations
when memory is desperately depleted without any sign of a forward
progress. If there is a reclaimable memory then we are not there yet.
If a workload can benefit from early oom killing based on response time
then we have facilities to achieve that (e.g. PSI).
