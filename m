Hmm, I may have just run into this problem too. I'm using clang 11.0.1,
but even if I do something like:

unsigned long __no_sanitize_or_inline foo(unsigned long *p)
{
	return READ_ONCE_NOCHECK(*p);
}

then I /still/ get calls to __tcsan_func_{entry,exit} emitted by the
compiler. Marco -- how do you turn this thing off?!

I'm also not particularly fond of treating __{READ,WRITE}ONCE() as "atomic",
since they're allowed to tear and I think callers should probably either be
using data_race() explicitly or disabling instrumentation (assuming that's
possible).
