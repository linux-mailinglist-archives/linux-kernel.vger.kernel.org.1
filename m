If it's of any help, I'll see if we can implement that warning in LLVM
if data dependencies somehow disappear (although I don't have any
cycles to pursue right now myself). Until then, short of manual
inspection or encountering a bug in the wild, there is no proof any of
this happens or doesn't happen.

Also, as some anecdotal evidence it's extremely unlikely, even with
LTO: looking at the passes that LLVM runs, there are a number of
passes that seem to want to eliminate basic blocks, thereby getting
rid of branches. Intuitively, it makes sense, because branches are
expensive on most architectures (for GPU targets, I think it tries
even harder to get rid of branches). If we extend our reasoning and
assumptions of LTO's aggressiveness in that direction, we might
actually end up with fewer branches. That might be beneficial for the
data dependencies we worry about (but not so much for control
dependencies we want to keep). Still, no point in speculating (no pun
intended) until we have hard data what actually happens. :-)

Thanks,
