I don't know good enough on the reuse refactoring patch (which at least looks
functionally correct), but... IMHO we still need the enforced cow logic no
matter we refactor the page reuse logic or not, am I right?

Example:

  - Process A & B shares private anonymous page P0

  - Process A does READ of get_user_pages() on page P0

  - Process A (e.g., another thread of process A, or as long as process A still
    holds the page P0 somehow) writes to page P0 which triggers cow, so for
    process A the page P0 is replaced by P1 with identical content

Then process A still keeps the reference to page P0 that potentially belongs to
process B or others?

Thanks,
