All pages will be written to the swap device in step 2.  But the normal
swapout path isn't used.  So these pages will be restored in step 3
instead of step 4.  But at the beginning of step 2, system may try to
reclaim some pages, the reclaimed anonymous pages will be restored in
step 4.  This may be avoided via setting /proc/sys/vm/swappiness to 0
before step 2.
