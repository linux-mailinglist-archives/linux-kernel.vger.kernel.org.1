There's some rather odd logic in sun4i_pwm_apply() that results in the
PWM being disabled twice... once when it applies the initial config
and again after waiting for a duty_cycle.

I suspect disabling the initial disable would solve your issue... but it
might provoke some new ones!

Anyhow, try removing the else clause starting at line 299 and see what
happens:
