I fixed that one a bit differently in
"ASoC: hdmi-codec: Fix return value in hdmi_codec_set_jack()"
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git/commit/?h=for-5.11&id=2a0435df963f996ca870a2ef1cbf1773dc0ea25a

It might be useful to implement the jack detection in adv7511, but
I guess we would also need some changes in sound/soc/qcom/apq8016_sbc.c
to setup SND_JACK_LINEOUT. And somehow there would need to be a way to
differentiate between the normal audio jack and the "HDMI jack".

I agree, especially in case more special DAIs are added in the future.
However, in my patch I tried to avoid doing that for the following two reasons:

  - Changing dt-bindings after they are added is generally discouraged.

but more importantly:

  - lpass-ipq806x.c does not seem to have PRIMARY, SECONDARY, ...
    but something completely different. I know nothing about that
    platform so I would not know how to handle it.

I will post my patch and then you can decide.

Thanks,
Stephan
