Right, if two devices behave differently in a way that one behaviour is 
not a strict superset of the other, and there's no way to tell which is 
which by simply looking at the device itself, then by definition they 
are not compatible.

Indeed it's a pain in the bum for driver developers to be given a new 
thing that's 99.9% compatible with the old thing but the one tiny 
difference fundamentally breaks it, and the temptation to look for an 
easy way out is strong, but c'est la vie ;)

The question I always bear in mind for cases like these is this: If a 
kernel without the driver patch runs on the new system with the expected 
new DTB, will it:

A) work entirely correctly
B) ignore the device (with or without an error), but the rest of the 
system still works fine
C) ignore the device and fail to boot at all (with or without an error) 
because it's critical to operation of the rest of the system
D) probe the device and superficially appear to be OK but actually be 
broken in weird and subtle ways

A and B are the ideal answers. C is a little unfortunate, but acceptable 
if neither A nor B is possible. D is a sign that you're doing something 
wrong, unless there are *very* specific circumstances that might justify 
it (e.g. the SoC is exclusively deployed in embedded devices with a 
controlled update mechanism such that users could never introduce this 
mismatch in the first place).
