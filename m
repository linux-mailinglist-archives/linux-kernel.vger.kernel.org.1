Yes, we'll still need some kind of hook somewhere to make identity 
domains work at all - my point about cfg_probe was to keep the 
reservation and configuration of the special identity context, plus the 
handling of the initial SME state, simple and entirely internal to the 
impl. In terms of where said hook should be, TBH it might actually work 
out pretty clean to simply hook GR0 register accesses so you can rewrite 
between S2CR bypass entries and translation entries targeting your 
reserved context on-the-fly. Failing that, something to massage "type" 
and "cbndx" in arm_smmu_domain_add_master() would be the next best 
option, I think.
