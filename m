Yes, but in the end it's a judgement call as to what the boundary is.
Take clocks for example, in the beginning we were trying to describe
clocks on a mux/divider/gate level in DT. We realized this would
result in hundreds to thousands of DT nodes and it would never be
completely correct. So we model only the leaf clocks for the most part
and there's lots of SoC code for clock controller blocks still.

The questions for having properties or not to ask is:

Is this board specific? Yes, then use a property.

Who needs to change this and when? Should/would you want to control
this in your PC BIOS or via a BIOS update?


Zero SoC code was never a goal. It was about a standard way to define
SoCs and having common frameworks (we have a common clock api, but not
implementation at the time). We have *way* less SoC code per SoC than
we used to. At the start of the DT conversion for Arm, we had ~400
boards and now we're at ~1400 last I checked.

As I said, if the h/w is 'exactly the same' (hint: it rarely is), then
use a fallback compatible. Then the new SoC specific compatible is
there just in case.

Think of compatible just as a VID/PID in PCI and USB land (though the
closest thing to a fallback there is class codes). They are the only
way we can uniquely identify h/w.
