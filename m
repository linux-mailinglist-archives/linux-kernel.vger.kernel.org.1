Valid concern and I too am with the same opinion. However as Mark Brown
points out this was added to just satisfy some exiting consumers that
rely on regulators.

I had or still argue that we need a way to check if this is not getting
misused with devices like CPUs. I was thinking of some check with DT where
such properties are not allowed in certain device type.

Thanks Mark for the explaining this, saved me time ðŸ˜„.
