I don't see a problem with the aforementioned patch [2] to pre-set BTI
on the pages of the main binary.

The original rationale here was that ld.so doesn't _need_ this, since it
is going to examine the binary's ELF headers anyway.  But equally, if
the binary is marked as supporting BTI then it's safe to enable BTI for
the binary's own pages.


I'd tend to agree that an AT_FLAGS flag doesn't add much.  I think real
EPERMs would only be seen in assert-fail type situations.  Failure of
mmap() is likely to result in a segfault later on, or correct operation
with weakened permissions on some pages.  Given the likely failure
modes, that situation doesn't feel too bad.

Yes, the design means that a page's PROT_BTI can be set safely if the
code in that page was compiled for BTI, irrespective of how other pages
were compiled.  The reasons why we don't do this at finer granularity
are (a) is't not very useful, and (b) ELF images only contain a BTI
property note for the whole image, not per segment.

I think that ld.so already makes this decision at ELF image granularity
(unless someone contradicts me).
