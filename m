I am not clear with the definition of "submission queues". Is it the device
queue with DMA ring buffer?

If it is the DMA ring buffer, multiple blk_mq_hw_ctx would map to the same DMA
ring buffer, e.g., multiple nvme namespaces would share the same tagset. This is
not 1:1 any longer.

Assume I am a beginner and does not know about blk-mq well. What I expect is to
expand this sections to explain the usage of sbitmap to manage tags, e.g., like
the comments in block/blk-mq-tag.c or block/blk-mq-tag.h.

In addition, I would be interested in that percpu-refcount is used to track the
lifecycle of requests.

I have no idea how much detail is required for a kernel doc. The is just the
feedback from me by assuming the audience is beginner :)

Thank you very much!
