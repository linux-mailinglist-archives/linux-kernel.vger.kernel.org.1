We were using "TAP version 14" since the "extensions" we are using
were all proposed among the TAP people to go into the next version of
TAP. Based on discussions among them they seem to like the subtest
stuff:

https://github.com/TestAnything/testanything.github.io/pull/36

Anyway, I can still appreciate that they might change their minds.

I just thought it was okay because it was already in their proposed
TAP14 spec, but yeah, if we just decide amongst ourselves to use it,
we should probably do something else.

I am cool with that.

Yeah, I agree: it would be better if there was just one version of
(K)TAP in the kernel.

I thought that is not in the TAP spec?

I kind of like printing out ahead of time how many tests we expect to
run, so if we crash we know how many tests weren't run.

In any case, until we get the change in that David is referencing, we
cannot print out the test plan for the "super test" before or after
because KUnit doesn't know when it is "done". So moving it to the
bottom doesn't really help us.

Yes.

At the top level, we have all test suites. Each subtest in TAP is a
test suite in KUnit. Each case in each subtest in TAP is a test case
in KUnit.

Just the sub-tests. Each subtest is responsible for counting it's own cases:

https://github.com/isaacs/testanything.github.io/blob/tap14/tap-version-14-specification.md#subtests
