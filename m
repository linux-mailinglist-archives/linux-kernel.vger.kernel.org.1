Yes this was discussed and it is done so deliberately. I have added the
build dependency when I merged the patch. There's no dependency on
CONFIG_PSCI.

Nope, we don't want mixture here. Why is the system not using PSCI/SMCCC ?

It was rejected, you can try your luck with OPTEE :)
We will just use the system conduit here with SCMI for SMC/HVC transport.
Details in previous version of the patch.

As stated not needed if we use  arm_smccc_1_1_invoke()

I need to check that.
