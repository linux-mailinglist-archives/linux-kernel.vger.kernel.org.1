I'd expect that count to be incremented by 1 for each PMD that it's
mapped to?  ie change the definition of that counter slightly.

There are somewhat fewer places that make that assumption after applying
the ~80 patches here ... http://git.infradead.org/users/willy/pagecache.git

I have mostly not touched the anonymous THPs (obviously some of the code
paths are shared), although both Kirill & I think there's a win to be
had there too.
