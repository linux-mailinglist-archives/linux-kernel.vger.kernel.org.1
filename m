Ulf recent patches for increased timeout adds capability 
MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY for sdhci-tegra as well.

So, it will always use R1B for R1B type commands so there are no known 
bugs or failures with mmc devices we use on our platforms.

So, we can treat this patch as an improvement for long operation 
commands where HW will wait as long as device is busy.

Yes, should be fine to have this from 5.4.y

For 5.4.y and 5.5.y, we can back-port same patch that was applied to 5.6.y

Will send back-port request of that..

Thanks

Sowjanya
