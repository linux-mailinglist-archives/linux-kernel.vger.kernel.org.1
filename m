Yes, I'm aware of this problem.  We're not able to update the home page at
the moment.  This problem is being worked on.

Actually, it is a script, and the fact that you say it is a binary may be
the reason for your python problem.  Normally there is a script
(scripts/spatch) that make install puts in place that refers back to where
your Coccinelle is installed.

OK.  A lot of documentation for a lot of projects seems to omit the sudo,
but I have indeed never understood why.

Maybe try again with make distclean, ./autogen, ./configure, sudo make
install?
