Ok, that makes sense. 

The situation with Ceph is a bit different I think. I suspect that we're
cleaning the inode out of the client's caches after drop_caches, but
then we end up issuing a lookup by inode number to the MDS and it
returns an inode that it may be in the process of purging.

The real question I have is whether this is truly a client-side issue,
or if the MDS is satisfying lookup-by-ino requests with inodes that just
haven't yet been fully purged. If so, then the right fix may be in the
MDS.

Can we determine that one way or the other?
