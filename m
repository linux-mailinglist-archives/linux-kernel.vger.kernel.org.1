Thanks for working on this, Sargun! I'll briefly interrupt the code
review to explain why this is an important enhancement for our
application. I=E2=80=99m posting this message on behalf of the Chromium pro=
ject,
which powers Google Chrome and several other open-source browsers (Edge,
Brave, Yandex Browser, etc.).

Chromium uses Seccomp-BPF to reduce the kernel attack surface available
to our child processes. These processes directly parse and manipulate
untrustworthy data downloaded from the Internet, an inherently risky
activity. We rely on Seccomp-BPF (along with other sandboxing
technologies) to help limit the potential damage to a system in the
event that the process is compromised.

One major blocking issue for us is filesystem-related syscalls. Our
default sandbox policy does not permit any filesystem access. Certain
child processes are permitted to access files on an explicit allow-list,
which we enforce by using SECCOMP_RET_TRAP on openat() (and other
syscalls that take a pathname), the signal handler for which forwards
the request to an unsandboxed broker process, and then passes the
resulting FD back via an SCM_RIGHTS message. However, this doesn=E2=80=99t =
work
if signals are disabled when the child process performs the system call.
Significantly, glibc is beginning to disable signals around entire
library functions. So, we are investigating the SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF
facilities to replace our current signals-based mechanism.

The issue is that there is currently no good way to pass an FD from the
tracer back to the tracee when using SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF, even though
this is a normal task for a system call implementation.

So, we need to switch to SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF before glibc
incompatibilities invisibly break our Linux users. We are very eager to
see the addfd ioctl merged, since it would allow us to implement our file
brokering sandbox.
