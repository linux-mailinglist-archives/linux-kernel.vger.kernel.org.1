Thanks for incorporating in this. I believe this would be more efficient.

I'm not sure if this would work or not, but AFAICT, it is unlikely.
The nasty thing about cgroupv1 is you may end up having threads from
the same process in different cgroups although it is rare.

My initial thought is to make cpuset process only (the threads in the
same process must be in the same cpuset group), but it sounds not too
feasible either since it may break some user configurations.

That should be transient, shouldn't? The migration logic is supposed
to wake up kswapd on pmem nodes, then the pages should become
migratable in later retry.
