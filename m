Agreed it is unacceptable to break userspace, but I don't think it's 
irrelevant.  Perhaps the musings on pending userspace patches are.

My intent here was to point out it appears at first glance that 
something isn't behaving as expected in userspace, so fixing this would 
likely require some sort of work-around for broken userspace rather than 
straight-forward fixing of a bug in the kernel logic.  My intent was not 
to shift blame to something besides my code & testing for the 
regression, though I certainly see how it could be interpreted that way.

Regardless, I'm looking in to it.

Thanks,
