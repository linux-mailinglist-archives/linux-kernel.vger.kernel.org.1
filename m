I thought that one of the points of this patch series was to add a
"reg" property to any mfd child that was described by the
OF_MFD_CELL_REG() macro.

And that was meant to fix the problem where multiple indistinguishable
children existed.  The only instance I found of that (using the
weak search on OF_MFD_CELL()) was of compatible "stericsson,ab8500-pwm"
in drivers/mfd/ab8500-core.c.  You agreed with my email that
reported that.

So I thought that drivers/mfd/ab8500-core.c would be modified to
replace the multiple instances of compatible "stericsson,ab8500-pwm"
in OF_MFD_CELL() with OF_MFD_CELL_REG().

This is another problem with the patch series: there is no user
of OF_MFD_CELL_REG().  Please add one to the series.

OK, I was wrong about "silent".  There is a warning:
   pr_warn("%s: Failed to locate of_node [id: %d]\n",

> The

If the device probes and functions as usual without the child of_node,
then why does the node have any properties (for the cases of
arch/arm/boot/dts/ste-ab8500.dtsi and arch/arm/boot/dts/ste-ab8505.dtsi
the properties "clocks" and "clock-names").

Digging through that leads to yet another related question, or actually
sort of the same question.  Why do the child nodes with compatible
"stericsson,ab8500-pwm" have the properties "clocks" and "clock-names"
since the binding Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/ab8500.txt
does not list them?
