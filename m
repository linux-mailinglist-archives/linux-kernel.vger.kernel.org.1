I wouldn't say ACPI first - Linux will likely always have far better
DT coverage for these platforms, with DT overlays etc. However, there
is a strong pull from the industry to support Windows, VMware,
RHEL/Centos and the BSDs on these systems, which is why the ACPI
firmware port is important.

RPi4 is also the most easily obtained Linux/arm64 machine with a
proper and fairly complete implementation of standards-based rich
firmware, which is why it makes sense to support both ACPI and DT boot
on it in Linux.

Note that most of the ACPI tables were contributed by Microsoft in
order to boot Windows for IOT (or whatever it was called at the time)
on the RPi3; they weren't just pulled out of thin air.
