This patchset contains everything needed to integrate KASAN and KUnit.

KUnit will be able to:
(1) Fail tests when an unexpected KASAN error occurs
(2) Pass tests when an expected KASAN error occurs

Convert KASAN tests to KUnit with the exception of copy_user_test
because KUnit is unable to test those.

Add documentation on how to run the KASAN tests with KUnit and what to
expect when running these tests.

Depends on "[PATCH v3 kunit-next 0/2] kunit: extend kunit resources
API" patchset [1]

Changes from v5:
 - Split out the panic_on_warn changes to a separate patch.
 - Fix documentation to fewer to the new Kconfig names.
 - Fix some changes which were in the wrong patch.
 - Rebase on top of kselftest/kunit (currently identical to 5.7-rc1)

Changes from v4:
 - KASAN no longer will panic on errors if both panic_on_warn and
   kasan_multishot are enabled.
 - As a result, the KASAN tests will no-longer disable panic_on_warn.
 - This also means panic_on_warn no-longer needs to be exported.
 - The use of temporary "kasan_data" variables has been cleaned up
   somewhat.
 - A potential refcount/resource leak should multiple KASAN errors
   appear during an assertion was fixed.
 - Some wording changes to the KASAN test Kconfig entries.

Changes from v3:
 - KUNIT_SET_KASAN_DATA and KUNIT_DO_EXPECT_KASAN_FAIL have been
 combined and included in KUNIT_DO_EXPECT_KASAN_FAIL() instead.
 - Reordered logic in kasan_update_kunit_status() in report.c to be
 easier to read.
 - Added comment to not use the name "kasan_data" for any kunit tests
 outside of KUNIT_EXPECT_KASAN_FAIL().

Changes since v2:
 - Due to Alan's changes in [1], KUnit can be built as a module.
 - The name of the tests that could not be run with KUnit has been
 changed to be more generic: test_kasan_module.
 - Documentation on how to run the new KASAN tests and what to expect
 when running them has been added.
 - Some variables and functions are now static.
 - Now save/restore panic_on_warn in a similar way to kasan_multi_shot
 and renamed the init/exit functions to be more generic to accommodate.
 - Due to [2] in kasan_strings, kasan_memchr, and
 kasan_memcmp will fail if CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT is enabled so return
 early and print message explaining this circumstance.
 - Changed preprocessor checks to C checks where applicable.

Changes since v1:
 - Make use of Alan Maguire's suggestion to use his patch that allows
   static resources for integration instead of adding a new attribute to
   the kunit struct
 - All KUNIT_EXPECT_KASAN_FAIL statements are local to each test
 - The definition of KUNIT_EXPECT_KASAN_FAIL is local to the
   test_kasan.c file since it seems this is the only place this will
   be used.
 - Integration relies on KUnit being builtin
 - copy_user_test has been separated into its own file since KUnit
   is unable to test these. This can be run as a module just as before,
   using CONFIG_TEST_KASAN_USER
 - The addition to the current task has been separated into its own
   patch as this is a significant enough change to be on its own.
