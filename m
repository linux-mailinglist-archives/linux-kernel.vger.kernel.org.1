OK, moving x86 CRASH_ALIGN to 2M is suggested by Dave. Because
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN can be selected from 2M to 16M. So 2M seems good.
But, anyway, we should tell the reason why it need be changed in commit
log.


arch/x86/Kconfig:
config PHYSICAL_ALIGN
        hex "Alignment value to which kernel should be aligned"
        default "0x200000"
        range 0x2000 0x1000000 if X86_32
        range 0x200000 0x1000000 if X86_64

And the crashkernel=X,high being deleted need be told too. Otherwise
people reading the commit have to check why themselves. I didn't follow
the old version, can't see why ,high can't be specified explicitly.
