I have now mostly finished up the idea on the game part that is part of 
making an available source distribution a success. The gamedeveloper on 
*nix, becomes more a de-centralized idea, with netartists, and 
filecatalog and group on *nix. Really a conclusion on 3D Scene, and 
related culture. I have a channel on this here:

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpRoclymJiJWSEF_jDmWaLw

Remixing this culture that goes back to MS-Dos, Amiga, C64 as indie, and 
professional Irix typically.

Making Netstream X, representative of this culture, and all defining 
developments since.
