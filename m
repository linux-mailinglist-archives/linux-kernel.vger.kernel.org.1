Hi Linus,

Here is a simple change for this cycle. The rest being routed through another
tree but see below for that.

/* Summary */
The main changes for this cycle is the extension for clone3() to support
spawning processes directly into cgroups via CLONE_INTO_CGROUP now in mainline
as ef2c41cf38a7 ("clone3: allow spawning processes into cgroups"). Since I had
to touch kernel/cgroup/ quite a bit I had Tejun route it through his tree this
time to make it easier for him to handle other changes and I see that you've
pulled already. So here are just unexciting leftovers.

As promised in addcb1d0ee31 here's a regression test for the ENOMEM regression
we fixed in b26ebfe12f34 ("pid: Fix error return value in some cases")
verifying that we report ENOMEM when trying to create a new process in a pid
namespace whose init process/subreaper has already exited.

The following changes since commit 2c523b344dfa65a3738e7039832044aa133c75fb:

  Linux 5.6-rc5 (2020-03-08 17:44:44 -0700)

are available in the Git repository at:

  git@gitolite.kernel.org:pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/brauner/linux tags/threads-v5.7

for you to fetch changes up to 6952a4f646446fde9e190b62c5e45f84c6cf91aa:

  selftests: add pid namespace ENOMEM regression test (2020-03-25 13:50:34 +0100)

/* Testing */
All patches are based on v5.6-rc6 and have been sitting in linux-next for a
while. (Full disclosure, I had these patches sitting in my tree locally for
quite longer but missed to merge them into my for-next branch so they have
only been in linux-next for about 10 days but without any issues.)

/* Conflicts */
At the time of creating this PR no merge conflicts were observed in
linux-next.

Please consider pulling these changes from the signed threads-v5.7 tag.

Thanks!
Christian
