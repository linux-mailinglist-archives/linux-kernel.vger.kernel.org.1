Hmm, it's still worrying that you had that patch kicking around though, as
it sounds like it /used/ to be broken. Would you be able to test the LTS
kernels (5.4, 4.19, 4.14, 4.9, 4.4) to check that we're not missing a
backport, please? Sorry to be a pain, but I'd like to get to the bottom of
this!

Thanks,

Will
