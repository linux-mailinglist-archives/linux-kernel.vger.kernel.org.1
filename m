With Sibi's patch [1] then ${SUBJECT} patch is no longer needed since
we are no longer called during "noirq" / "syscore" time.  Assuming
Sibi's patches (or something similar to them) are OK, we can consider
this patch abandoned.  I'll re-post patch #2 on its own once we get
confirmation that Sibi's patches are OK w/ folks.
