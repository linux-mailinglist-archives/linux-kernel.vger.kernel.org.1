As I mentioned the TCPM driver has a lot of issues. The "hard reset" 
isn't implemented correctly so going into that mode gets it stuck in a 
bad state. Note I am using this dongle [1], and it only works correctly 
in sink mode (with the dongle providing power), in source mode it does 
negotiate the alt mode, but never gets the HPD event that DP driver is 
waiting for.
