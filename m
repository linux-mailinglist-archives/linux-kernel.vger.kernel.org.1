I agree. The patch does not apply to mmotm. Can you try the incremental
patch below? It should apply to mmotm.


Hi Andrew and Anshuman,

Should Anshuman resend the incremental patch or Andrew can fold it along
with the two patches in mmotm into one?

-THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS is when THP is migrated successfully without getti=
ng
-split into it's subpages. THP_MIGRATION_FAILURE is when THP could neithe=
r
-be migrated nor be split. THP_MIGRATION_SPLIT is when THP could not
-just be migrated as is but instead get split into it's subpages and late=
r
-retried as normal pages. THP events would also update normal page migrat=
ion
-statistics PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS and PGMIGRATE_FAILURE. These events will he=
lp
-in quantifying and analyzing various THP migration events including both=

-success and failure cases.
+
+The following events (counters) can be used to monitor page migration.
+
+1. PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS: Normal page migration success. Each count means th=
at a
+   page was migrated. If the page was a non-THP page, then this counter =
is
+   increased by one. If the page was a THP, then this counter is increas=
ed by
+   the number of THP subpages. For example, migration of a single 2MB TH=
P that
+   has 4KB-size base pages (subpages) will cause this counter to increas=
e by
+   512.
+
+2. PGMIGRATE_FAIL: Normal page migration failure. Same counting rules as=
 for
+   _SUCCESS, above: this will be increased by the number of subpages, if=
 it was
+   a THP.
+
+3. THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS: A THP was migrated without being split.
+
+4. THP_MIGRATION_FAIL: A THP could not be migrated nor it could be split=
=2E
+
+5. THP_MIGRATION_SPLIT: A THP was migrated, but not as such: first, the =
THP had
+   to be split. After splitting, a migration retry was used for it's sub=
-pages.
+
+THP_MIGRATION_* events also update the appropriate PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS or
+PGMIGRATE_FAIL events. For example, a THP migration failure will cause b=
oth
+THP_MIGRATION_FAIL and PGMIGRATE_FAIL to increase.
