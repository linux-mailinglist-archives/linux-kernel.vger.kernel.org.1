To add to this, we initially also weren't sure what the results would be
toggling the static branches at varying intervals. In the end we were
pleasantly surprised, and our benchmarking results always proved there
is no noticeable slowdown above 100ms (somewhat noticeable in the range
of 1-10ms but it's tolerable if you wanted to go there).

I think we were initially, just like you might be, deceived about the
time scales here. 100ms is a really long time for a computer.

The really important bit here is to differentiate between fast-paths and
slow-paths!

We insert kfence_alloc() into the allocator fast-paths, which is where
the majority of cost would be. On the other hand, the major user of
is_kfence_address(), kfence_free(), is only inserted into the slow-path.

As a result, is_kfence_address() usage has negligible cost (esp. if the
statically allocated pool is used) -- we benchmarked this quite
extensively.

[ See my answer for the cost of is_kfence_address() above. In short,
  until we add is_kfence_address() to fast-paths, introducing yet
  another static branch would be premature optimization. ]

You can already do this. Just set CONFIG_KFENCE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL=0. When
you decide to enable it, set kfence.sample_interval=<somenumber> as a
boot parameter.

I'll add something to that effect into Documentation/dev-tools/kfence.rst.
