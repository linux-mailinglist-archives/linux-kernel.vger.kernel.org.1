I think I may have found a way out of this: I may not need to use
smp_call_function_single() at all.

When preempting a paired task, I think we can rely on memory barrier at the
beginning of scheduling of the paired task to match the memory barrier at
the end of scheduling of the kworker thread to provide memory ordering. Therefore,
the IPI is not needed at all in this case.

When preempting the kworker thread, things are a bit trickier. AFAIU I can simply
queue task work on the paired task directly without an IPI, and then use
kick_process() on the paired task.

The remaining concern is whether kick_process() (and thus smp_send_reschedule())
is sufficient to guarantee a memory barrier before smp_send_reschedule returns ?
I suspect not, because it only raises the IPI, and does not appear to wait for
its handler to complete. In that case I need a release on the paired task and
an acquire in sched_out of the kworker. The memory barrier at the end of schedule
fulfills the acquire, but I don't see how the acquire is done on the paired task,
because execution of its scheduler does not necessarily happen immediately when
the IPI is raised.

Thanks,

Mathieu
