My dearest one,

I am writing this mail to you with tears and sorrow from my heart.
With due respect, trust and humanity, I appeal to you to exercise a
little patience and read through my letter as I feel quite safe
dealing with you in this important business having gone through your
remarkable profile. Honestly I am writing this email to you with
pains, tears and sorrow in my heart, i would really like to have a
good relationship with you and I have a special reason why I decided
to contact you. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of my
situation.

My name is Miss.Analyze Kipkalya, 22yrs old female and i am from Kenya
in East Africa. Light in complexion, single (never married) but
presently I am residing here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso refugee
camp. My father Late Dr Kipkalya Kones was the former Kenyan road
Minister. He and Assistant Minister of Home Affairs Lorna Laboso had
been on board the Cessna 210, which was headed to Kericho and crashed
in a remote area called Kajong'a, in western Kenya. The plane crashed
on Tuesday 10th, June, 2008. You can re
ad more about the crash through the below site:
http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html?iref=
=3Dnextin
After the burial of my father, my Father brothers conspired and sold
my father' s property to an Italian Expert rate which they shared the
money among themselves and left nothing for me. One faithful morning,
I opened my father's briefcase and found out the documents which he
have deposited huge amount of money in one bank in Burkina Faso with
my name as the next of kin, because when he was alive he deposited
some amount of money in a Bank in Burkina Faso which he used my name
as the next of kin. The amount in question is $10.5Million.

I have informed the bank about claiming this money and the only thing
they told me is to look for a foreign partner who will assist me in
the transfer due to my refugee status here in Burkina Faso. My spirit
tells me that you are the honest and reliable person who will help me
and stand as my trustee so that I will present you to the Bank for
transferring my father=E2=80=99s money to your bank account overseas. I hav=
e
chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not
betray my trust. But rather take me as your own biological sister or
daughter which I will be coming to your country as soon as this money
is transferred to your account.

My dearest, things are very bad for me here in the refugee camp where
I am living today. People are dying here day after day because of lack
of food and poor medical treatment. Even one of us died last night and
was buried this morning. I am afraid of what i am seeing here. I don't
know who it will be her turn tomorrow; I was planning to read law in
my life before the ugly incident that killed my parents that put me in
this horrible place I found myself today. This place is like a prison
as we are only allowed to go out on Monday and Friday of the week as
given by the united nation rules and regulation here in Burkina Faso.
It=E2=80=99s in this refugee we are only allowed to go out two times in a
week. It's just like one staying in the prison and I hope to come out
here soon by your help.

I don' t have any relatives now whom i can go to and the only person i
have now is Rev Isaac Ambrose who is the pastor of the (Christ for all
Churches) here in the refugee he has been very nice to me since i came
here but i am not living with him rather i am leaving in the women's
hostel because the refugee have two hostels one for men the other for
women, so you can always contact me through this my both email
address: (missanalyze_kipkalya@aol.com)
thanks and am waiting for your reply. Please if you want to help me
out of this situation respond back so that I will tell you more about
me.

Yours faithful
Miss. Analyze Kipkalya
