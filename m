Maybe the patch to make hw->init be NULL is just not useful and we
should revert it. The intent was to catch misbehaving drivers that tried
to use the init data after registration but then it causes problems like
we see here where drivers have static clk data mixed with static init
data that they unregister later and expect to be able to register again.

This is one of the failed design decisions we made early on to associate
the init data with the clk_hw struct instead of passing it as another
argument to clk_register().

Maybe a better workaround would be to always assign hw->init in the
driver before registering the clks? Basically make a clk registration
API that we should have made before.

int my_clk_register(struct clk_hw *hw, struct clk_init_data *init)
{
	hw->init =3D init;
	ret =3D clk_hw_register(dev, hw);
	...
}

Do you have some sort of array of clk_hw pointers to register? Maybe we
could make a new clk registration structure to simplify this for users,
but I'm not super interested in introducing yet another registration
API! :/

struct clk_hw_desc {
	struct clk_hw *hw;
	struct clk_init_data *init;
};

and then drivers can call clk_hw_register_bulk() or something like this:

int clk_hw_register_bulk(struct device *dev, const struct clk_hw_desc **des=
cs, size_t num_descs)
{
	int ret;
	int i;

	for (i =3D 0; i < num_descs; i++) {
		ret =3D some_internal_clk_register_func(dev, descs[i]->hw, descs[i]->init=
);
		if (ret)
			goto error;
	}

	return 0;
error:
	while (--i >=3D 0)
		clk_hw_unregister(...)

	return ret;
}
