I do prefer that to the introduction of an arch/missing.

Still, I'm not sure I see much benefit in splitting those small 
implementations in separate files, but it's not a problem either. This 
seems more a matter of taste rather than one approach working better 
than the other. So it's more up to what the maintainer prefer! :)
