I see this, thanks for digging into the explanation! Were you able to
get a test case where the unknowns went down? For example, by forcing
the code cache size to be small? This is the result I'd expect to see.

Hmm.. this is a bit weird as the compile_info at one point was a
resource allocation and so would be cleared out when the resource mark
was passed on the compiler's return. Not something you'd want to do
asynchronously. Presumably this has changed to improve performance,
but doing the jvmti on a separate thread defeats jitdump - if we see
samples in code ahead of the code being loaded. Perhaps a profiler
like async-profiler
(https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) has a
workaround for the lag.

C2 is pretty bad for having assembly stub routine helpers (aka stub
routines) that aren't "documented". C1 is less like this, but it is
increasingly hard to force C1 as the compiler. If you are seeing these
things as leaf routines then its likely some stub routine clean up
could fix the issue.

Thanks,
Ian
