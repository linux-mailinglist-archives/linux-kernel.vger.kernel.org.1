I have to ask: there are other camera drivers in existence already.
What makes your hardware so different that it requires all this data
processing to be done inside the kernel?

Note, the decision not to support kernel_neon_begin / kernel_neon_end in
hardirq context was deliberate.  hardirq handlers shouldn't usually do
anything at all except ensure that something responds to the hardware
event, by waking some other thread or scheduling a workqueue item for
example.  An IRQ handler that only does that has no need to do any data
processing, and gains no advantage from using FPSIMD.

Doing additional work in hardirq context will harm interrupt latency for
the rest of the system.

So, you should move the data processing work out of the hardirq handler.
Is there a reason why this is not possible?


Secondly, there is the question of whether FPSIMD can be used by kernel
threads.  Currently this is only supported in a limited way.  Again,
this a deliberate decision, for now.

Can you split the processing work into small blocks using
kernel_neon_begin/kernel_neon_end, similarly to the arm64 crypto
drivers?

This is the current accepted way of doing number crunching inside the
kernel without harming preemption latency too much.  Even so, it's
primarily intended for things that affect critical paths inside the
kernel, such as crypto or checksumming in the filesysem and network
subsystems.
