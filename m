dump_tasks() is already using KERN_INFO, and the same problem remains. KERN_INFO cannot
prevent printk() from printing to consoles unless console loglevel is tuned. And tuning
console loglevel can prevent all KERN_INFO from printing to consoles. What I want is a
method for allowing administrators to control whether to print each message to consoles.
Such method will be by definition controlled via "+ loglevel assigned to each message".

Please please please DON'T IGNORE THE SWITCH.

Exactly. Therefore, we will need a switch which controls whether to add
KERN_NO_CONSOLES modifier (e.g. extending /proc/sys/vm/oom_dump_tasks if
KERN_NO_CONSOLES were useful to only dump_tasks()). Practically I would
propose /proc/sys/vm/print_oom_messages which is a bitmap for which OOM-
related messages should prevent printk() from being written to consoles.

I was worrying about difficulty in the callee side, but you are worrying
about difficulty of the caller side. Then, ...

No. That is a pointless concern.
Forgetting to add KERN_NO_CONSOLES is unrelated to the critical path.

Again, a pointless concern. We can try to eliminate KERN_CONT from printk()
callers when adding KERN_NO_CONSOLES to printk() callers, provided that
KERN_CONT could become a concern.

What I'm saying is:

  Don't count on KERN_$LOGLEVEL. Like you said "developers already have
  troubles to decide between the existing 8 loglevels.", there are only 8
  levels which are effectively unchangable/unusable for controlling which
  messages should be printed to consoles. Therefore, allow developers and
  administrators to control which messages should not be printed to consoles
  using SOME SWITCH YOU ARE IGNORING. Majority of kernel messages are not
  urgent enough to require synchronously writing to consoles. Only oops-
  related messages (and possibly watchdog-related messages) would worth
  writing to consoles synchronously. Skip writing non-urgent messages when
  urgent condition happens will be a concern when asynchronous printk() is
  added. If KERN_NO_CONSOLES were introduced, we can allow developers and
  administrators to control which messages are non-urgent messages.

Given that said, if KERN_NO_CONSOLES is not acceptable, I have to again
battle against Michal Hocko regarding how to offload OOM-related messages,
like Sergey Senozhatsky estimated

  "I'd say that lockless logbuf probably will land sometime around 5.8+.
  Async printk() - unknown."

last month.
