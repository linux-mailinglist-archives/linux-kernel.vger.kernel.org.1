Yes, that's the typical product life cycle. It presumes a short window of 
opportunity for sales (suggesting that demand is not organic).

Most vendors like to avoid having to compete with their own prior product 
lines. Hence the constrained lifespan that we get from devices with 
out-of-tree Linux ports.

AFAICS open source licenses cannot really prevent this (no matter how many 
freedoms the FSF would like to confer on people). However, consumer law 
could do it, if it were to disallow products which were not servicable.

And without bug reports, breakage gets leveraged into deletion, using the 
bogus argument that "broken" code is proof of zero potential users.

So all a vendor has to do is make maintenance a bit too difficult for 
competent users e.g. by depriving them of access to existing 
documentation.

It was only a few decades ago that every applicance you bought came with a 
printed circuit schematic. These days, every device you buy comes with 
built-in obsolescence and a customer lock-in strategy.
