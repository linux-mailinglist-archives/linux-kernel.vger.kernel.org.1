So would something like this in drm_atomic_helper.c work?

void drm_atomic_helper_delete_private_obj(struct drm_atomic_state *state,
=09=09=09=09=09int i)
{
=09struct drm_private_obj *obj =3D state->private_objs[i].ptr;
=09int end =3D state->num_private_objs-1;

=09obj->funcs->atomic_destroy_state(obj, state->private_objs[i].state);

=09/* If i is not at the end of the array then the last element
=09 * needs to be moved to where i was before the array can safely
=09 * be truncated.
=09 */
=09if (i !=3D end)
=09=09state->private_objs[i] =3D state->private_objs[end];

=09state->private_objs[end].ptr =3D NULL;
=09state->private_objs[end].state =3D NULL;
=09state->private_objs[end].old_state =3D NULL;
=09state->private_objs[end].new_state =3D NULL;

=09state->num_private_objs =3D end;
}

I was considering doing something like that, but I wanted to avoid
modifying DRM core to fix a bug in amdgpu. I guess this makes more sense
though since it does seem rather unorthodox to make changes to
drm_atomic_state outside of DRM core. Perhaps there will be a use for this
function outside of this patch in the future.
