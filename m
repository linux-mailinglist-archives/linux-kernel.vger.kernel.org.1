Agreed, and that's why I'm planning to make the target as a simple
identifier[1] that independent of the real types of the targets.  It will be
interpreted by only the low level primitive implementation.  From the core
logic's perspective, it will not be interpreted at all but only required to be
unique among the targets of the monitoring context (damon_ctx).  The changed
version will be posted in the next spin.

I would like to argue that the optimization is the core part of DAMON that
makes its difference: It provides _controllable_ tradeoff between the accuracy
and the overhead while doing the best effort for the accuracy.  Even on
physical memory space, the logic works well if the memory is not highly
segmented.  Even under the significant segmentation, it could provide a sign of
compaction necessity.  I also believe compaction and DAMON can complement each
other.  Nonetheless, the optimization could be turned off by manipulating the
DAMON's attributes if needed.

In this case, because DAMON provides the low level primitives for the virtual
address space and the physical address space itself, the user could simply make
two DAMON contexts, one for the virtual address parts of the processes in the
cgroup and one for physical address part of the cgroup and run those in
parallel.

Or, you could implement another low level primitives for cgroups usecase.  If
your usecase is somewhat complex and need some level of optimization, I think
this is the right way.  The low level primitive implementation should provide
methods[1] for 1) identifying the target, 2) constructing the monitoring target
address ranges, and 3) checking access of small address ranges in the target
ranges.  The implementation for cgroups could 1) use cgroup ids as the target
ids, 2) construct the target address ranges by integrating the address spaces
of the processes in the cgroup and the related physical memory regions (maybe
you could convert every address ranges to physical address), and 3) use page
table walk/rmap and PTE/PMD Accessed bit for the access checking.

Agreed.  For now, DAMON provides three interfaces for the user space.  First
and the main one is the debugfs interface[1].  I chose debugfs because it's
relatively easy to change the interface.  Second one is tracepoint[2].  It only
provides monitoring time, the target id, and the monitored access frequency of
each region.  I believe this is sufficiently abstracted format.  Final one is
user space tool[3] written in python.  It is only a wrapper of the debugfs
interface.  I believe keeping the higher level interface will not be hard.

Each DAMON context is proccessed by one kthread.  Therefore, running each of or
a group of targets in dedicated kthread is naturally supported.

Thanks again for the questions.  If I misunderstood your points or my answers
are insufficient to understand, please don't hesitate letting me know :)
