Oh dear, usually the paging register is always visible :/

That's not too surprising for something like this.

Single level pages are in there already, TI is a big user but I've seen
this from other vendors too.  I do remember some discussion of multi
level paging before, I think with a TI part, and I *think* it already
happens to work without needing to do anything but I'd need to go back
and check and it's 7pm on a Friday night.  IIRC if one paging register
is within another paged region the code manages to recurse and sort
things out, but I could be wrong.  I agree that it's a bit specialist if
it needs anything non-trivial and something driver local would be
reasonable.

Yeah, that's reasonable - I was just thinking about checking it against
the size of the file to make sure it doesn't actually overflow the
buffer and corrupt things or crash.  Obviously sanity checking is good
but there's limits on what's sensible.
