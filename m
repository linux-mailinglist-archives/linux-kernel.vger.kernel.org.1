Ok. Doug and I talked today and I re-read the earlier series and I think
Sudeep was suggesting that if we're doing last man down activities here
then we're better off using OSI vs. PC mode. But I can only assume
that's because the concern is something here requires software's help
for last man down activities like lowering a CPU voltage setting or
turning off some power switch to a hardware block through some i2c
message. The way I understand it the last man down activities here are
just setting up the sleep and wake TCS FIFOs to "do the right thing"
when the last CPU actually goes down and the first CPU wakes up by
running through the pile of "instructions" that we program into the
FIFOs.

The execution of those instructions is all done in hardware so any
aggregation or coordination between CPUs is not really important here.
All that matters is that we set up the sleep and wake TCS FIFOs properly
so that _if_ the whole CPU subsystem goes to sleep we're going to let
the hardware turn off the right stuff and lower voltages, etc. and
vice-versa for wake. If we didn't have to share the TCS FIFOs with
active mode control then we could just tweak the sleep and wake TCS
buckets at runtime and let the hardware state of the CPUs decide to
trigger them at the right time. Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury
and we're stuck repurposing the sleep TCS FIFO to control things like
regulator voltages when the CPU is awake. Yuck!

I guess this answer to this is yes. Which is fine. CPU PM notifiers are
still used by various drivers to do things like save/restore state of
devices that lose state when the CPUs power down. The use of genpd is
helpful for OSI mode because it can describe how/when big and little
clusters are powered off by putting them in different genpds. For
counting the last CPU to turn off it seems simpler to just register for
CPU PM notifiers and not care about genpd logic and nesting clusters,
etc. I'm happy to see this not be a blocker.
