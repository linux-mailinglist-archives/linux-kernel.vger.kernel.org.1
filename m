And every time you do any arithmetic they get extended to int.
And if you pass them to a function (as char) the compiler
has to mask the result of any arithmetic back to 8 bits.

On x86 the compiler can use the 'as if' rule and do 8 bit arithmetic.
But only if it can determine that the high bits aren't actually used.
On almost every other architecture you are likely to get a lot
of masking operations.

Just because the domain of a variable of 0..255 doesn't mean
that 'unsigned char' is an appropriate type for a variable.

For x86-64 (and probably others) 'unsigned int' is usually best for
anything that cannot be negative.
In particular it saves the sign extension instruction that has to
be inserted when an 'int' variable is used as an array index.

FWIW I think that somewhere else the ~mask had to be replaced
with (mask ^ 0xff) do avoid another spurious compiler warning.
