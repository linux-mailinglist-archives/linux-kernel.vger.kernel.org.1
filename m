If "fatal" is meaningless for BLD, we can remove it for BLD. If we need
it in the future, we can add it later.

The "ratelimit:N" maybe more useful for BLD: it mitigates DOS from bus locks.

But the two features are related if both of them are enabled in hardware:
If a split lock happens, SLD will generate #AC before instruction execution
and BLD will generate #DB after instruction execution.

The software needs to make them exclusive. The same kernel option reflects
the relationship and make them exclusive, e.g. "fatal" enables SLD and
disables BLD, "warn" does the other way.

If using two different kernel options, the user needs to give right options
to make both work, e.g. can the user give this combination
"split_lock_detect=fatal bus_lock_detect=warn"? What does the combination
mean? There could be many combinations of the two options, some of them
are meaningful and some of them aren't. Maintaining the combinations is
unnecessary complex, right?

Thanks.
