Not so strong as an objection, and I won't get to see whether your
retry on -ENOENT is good (can -ENOENT arrive at that point from any
other case, that might endlessly retry?) until I've got the full
context; but I had arrived at the opposite conclusion overnight.

Given that this case only appeared with a fuzzer, and stale swapcache
reclaim is anyway relied upon to clean up after plenty of other such
races, I think we should agree that I over-complicated the VM_BUG_ON
removal originally, and it's best to kill that delete_from_swap_cache(),
and the comment having to explain it, and your EEXIST/ENOENT distinction.

(I haven't checked, but I suspect that the shmem_unuse_inode() case
that I copied from, actually really needed to delete_from_swap_cache(),
in order to swapoff the page without full retry of the big swapoff loop.)
