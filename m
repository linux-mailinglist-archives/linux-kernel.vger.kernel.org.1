Kind of, but it's this change to verb-noun from adj-noun that confuses the
resulting language: the verb form of the verb-noun doesn't distinguish
between its stand-alone action ("allowed") or its combined action
("allow-list-ed") in the same way that the verb form of the adj-noun does
(the verbed adj-noun is its own word). To me to looks like "allowed" and
"whitelisted" mean distinct things (as in, a single allowance vs being
added to the persistent list of allowances).

So "I will allow this system call once" and "I will allow all instances
of this syscall", or we just get used to using the verb-noun as a whole,
and embrace "I allowlisted the syscall."

But yes, as I and others come back to: it's fine. We'll just use different
surrounding constructs to avoid confusion. But it is an odd characteristic
of English's grammar (or lack of appropriately descriptive adjectives) to
not have a drop-in replacement. (Which is where I think the master/slave
replacements fair far better -- the whitelist replacement is more complex,
but it's mostly just English glitchiness.)
