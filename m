Some repetition here. I assume it's because the commit ID is not stable
because it's in linux-next.

Why is it appropriate for init_unavailable_mem to add a e820 reserved
range to the zone at all? The bug being triggered indicates there is a
mismatch between the zone of a struct page and the PFN passed in.

This implies that we have struct pages that should never be used (e820
reserved) but exist somehow in a zone range but with broken linkages to
their node and zone.

Why is the correct fix not to avoid creating struct pages for e820
ranges and make sure that struct pages that are reachable have proper
node and zone linkages?
