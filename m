We don't rely on 32-bits vs. 64-bits, u32 should be fine.

It may for now, but going forward we may have different flags to 
indicate various functions supported by RSC.

Hmm, we can. Patch 2 of this series already added different function 
which will be called where solver is present.
Let me modify this to indicate whether called from last cpu or not.
