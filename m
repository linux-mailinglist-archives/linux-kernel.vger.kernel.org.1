I think the approach you added in this patch set makes sense if there
are DSP firmwares that offer less FE/MultiMedia DAIs.

For the future it would be nice if we could make this less "confusing"
by hiding/removing the invalid mixers, e.g. if you have only
MultiMedia1 enabled you don't see all the mixers for MultiMedia2-8.
For that it doesn't matter if we do it in q6routing (might become
quite complex with all the macros there), or in a generic way by walking
the DAPM graph as Mark mentioned.

I was also thinking if we can somehow restore the default routing
in a conditional way, so that you don't need to duplicate the
information in the device tree:

  e.g. right now you need to add

	&q6asm {
		dai@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};

  *and* the routing

	sound {
		audio-routing =
			"MM_DL1", "MultiMedia1 Playback",
			"MultiMedia1 Capture", "MM_UL1";
	};

When I made these changes I needed several tries until I had it correct,
because sometimes I forgot one of the routes, sometimes I mixed up some
numbers etc. And especially when you add all 8 FE DAIs this becomes
really noisy for an information that we could (theoretically) infer
only based on the part under &q6asm.

I will think about it some more and see if I come up with something nice.

Stephan
