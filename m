Also for gcc4 which doesn't support this at all -- that will report
error on cc-option. We don't need to support it, but we shouldn't let it
be enabled either.

Yes, the gcc driver reports an error when deciding what to pass to the
assembler for -gz=zlib, if it was configured with a linker that does not
support the flag. It's even more weird actually -- if it was configured
with a linker that supports the flag but an assembler that doesn't, it
will silently eat the flag when calling the assembler. At least that
won't break anything, though none of the .o files will be compressed.

No, as-option does invoke the assembler. The problem here is that with
-Wa, the option is only seen by the assembler, not the gcc driver. So it
will succeed because the assembler supports it, but it will not test
whether the gcc driver also supports it.

Yeah, we might want to fix the mismatch there.  In Kconfig, there aren't
any instances of cc-option being used with -Wa, but there certainly are
in Kbuild. It actually originally used to only run the preprocessor and
got fixed to at least run the compiler in commit
  3bed1b7b9d79 ("kbuild: use -S instead of -E for precise cc-option test in Kconfig")
