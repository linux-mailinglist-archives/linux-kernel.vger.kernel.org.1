What I'm seeing is that outer_cache.configure() gets called, at
least on exynos4412-odroidx2.  See l2c_enable():

	if (outer_cache.configure)
		outer_cache.configure(&l2x0_saved_regs);
	else
		l2x0_data->configure(base);

Then instead of l2c310_configure(), exynos_l2_configure() gets
called and writes prefetch_ctrl right before aux_ctrl.  Should
exynos_l2_configure() be changed to swap the register writes?

Yes with l2c310_configure() but not with exynos_l2_configure().

To be clear, this is what I've found to be happening, if you
switch to using the device tree prefetch attributes and clear
the bits in the default l2c_aux_val (see PATCH 3/3):

1. l2x0_of_init() first gets called with the default aux_val

2. l2c310_of_parse() sets the bits in l2x0_saved_regs.prefetch_ctrl
   but not in aux_val (unless you apply this patch 2/3)

3. l2c_enable() calls exynos_l2_configure() which writes
   prefetch_ctrl and then aux_ctrl - thus setting the prefetch bits
   and then clearing them just after

4. l2c310_enable() reads back aux_ctrl and prefetch, both of which
   now have the bits cleared (the pr_info() message about prefetch
   enabled gets skipped)


That's why I thought it would be safer to set the prefetch bits
in both registers so it should work regardless if the
initialisation sequence.  Also, if we want these bits to be
changed, we should clear them in the aux_mask value to not get
another error message about register corruption - so I'm doing
that too.

Thanks,
Guillaume
