Proper documentation for the design and usage of sequence counters and
sequential locks does not exist. Complete the seqlock.h documentation as
follows:

  - Divide all documentation on a seqcount_t vs. seqlock_t basis. The
    description for both mechanisms was intermingled, which is incorrect
    since the usage constrains for each type are vastly different.

  - Add an introductory paragraph describing the internal design of, and
    rationale for, sequence counters.

  - Document seqcount_t writer non-preemptibility requirement, which was
    not previously documented anywhere, and provide a clear rationale.

  - Provide template code for seqcount_t and seqlock_t initialization
    and reader/writer critical sections.

  - Recommend using seqlock_t by default. It implicitly handles the
    serialization and non-preemptibility requirements of writers.

At seqlock.h:

  - Remove references to brlocks as they've long been removed from the
    kernel.

  - Remove references to gcc-3.x since the kernel's minimum supported
    gcc version is 4.6.

  - Remove the severely lacking top comment and reference the newly
    introduced Documentation/locking/seqlock.rst file instead.

References: 0f6ed63b1707 ("no need to keep brlock macros anymore...")
References: cafa0010cd51 ("Raise the minimum required gcc version to 4.6")

+======================================
+Sequence counters and sequential locks
+======================================
+
+Introduction
+============
+
+Sequence counters are a reader-writer consistency mechanism with
+lockless readers (read-only retry loops), and no writer starvation. They
+are used for data that's rarely written to (e.g. system time), where the
+reader wants a consistent set of information and is willing to retry if
+that information changes.
+
+A data set is consistent when the sequence count at the beginning of the
+read side critical section is even and the same sequence count value is
+read again at the end of the critical section. The data in the set must
+be copied out inside the read side critical section. If the sequence
+count has changed between the start and the end of the critical section,
+the reader must retry.
+
+Writers increment the sequence count at the start and the end of their
+critical section. After starting the critical section the sequence count
+is odd and indicates to the readers that an update is in progress. At
+the end of the write side critical section the sequence count becomes
+even again which lets readers make progress.
+
+A sequence counter write side critical section must never be preempted
+or interrupted by read side sections. Otherwise the reader will spin for
+the entire scheduler tick due to the odd sequence count value and the
+interrupted writer. If that reader belongs to a real-time scheduling
+class, it can spin forever and the kernel will livelock.
+
+.. _seqcount_t:
+
+Sequence counters (:c:type:`seqcount_t`)
+========================================
+
+This is the the raw counting mechanism, which does not protect against
+multiple writers.  Write side critical sections must thus be serialized
+by an external lock.
+
+If the write serialization primitive is not implicitly disabling
+preemption, preemption must be explicitly disabled before entering the
+write side section. If the sequence counter read section can be invoked
+from hardirq or softirq contexts, interrupts or bottom halves must be
+respectively disabled before entering the write side section.
+
+If it's desired to automatically handle the sequence counter
+requirements of writer serialization and non-preemptibility, use a
+:ref:`sequential lock <seqlock_t>` instead.
+
+Initialization:
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+	/* dynamic */
+	seqcount_t foo_seqcount;
+	seqcount_init(&foo_seqcount);
+
+	/* static */
+	static seqcount_t foo_seqcount = SEQCNT_ZERO(foo_seqcount);
+
+	/* C99 struct init */
+	struct {
+		.seq   = SEQCNT_ZERO(foo.seq),
+	} foo;
+
+Write path:
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+	/* Serialized context with disabled preemption */
+
+	write_seqcount_begin(&foo_seqcount);
+
+	/* ... [[write-side critical section]] ... */
+
+	write_seqcount_end(&foo_seqcount);
+
+Read path:
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+	do {
+		seq = read_seqcount_begin(&foo_seqcount);
+
+		/* ... [[read-side critical section]] ... */
+
+	} while (read_seqcount_retry(&foo_seqcount, seq));
+
+.. _seqlock_t:
+
+Sequential locks (:c:type:`seqlock_t`)
+======================================
+
+This contains the :ref:`sequence counting mechanism <seqcount_t>`
+earlier discussed, plus an embedded spinlock for writer serialization
+and non-preemptibility.
+
+If the read side section can be invoked from hardirq or softirq context,
+use the write side function variants which respectively disable
+interrupts or bottom halves.
+
+Initialization:
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+	/* dynamic */
+	seqlock_t foo_seqlock;
+	seqlock_init(&foo_seqlock);
+
+	/* static */
+	static DEFINE_SEQLOCK(foo_seqlock);
+
+	/* C99 struct init */
+	struct {
+		.seql   = __SEQLOCK_UNLOCKED(foo.seql)
+	} foo;
+
+Write path:
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+	write_seqlock(&foo_seqlock);
+
+	/* ... [[write-side critical section]] ... */
+
+	write_sequnlock(&foo_seqlock);
+
+Read path, three categories:
+
+1. Normal Sequence readers which never block a writer but they must
+   retry if a writer is in progress by detecting change in the sequence
+   number.  Writers do not wait for a sequence reader.
+
+   .. code-block:: c
+
+	do {
+		seq = read_seqbegin(&foo_seqlock);
+
+		/* ... [[read-side critical section]] ... */
+
+	} while (read_seqretry(&foo_seqlock, seq));
+
+2. Locking readers which will wait if a writer or another locking reader
+   is in progress. A locking reader in progress will also block a writer
+   from entering its critical section. This read lock is
+   exclusive. Unlike rwlock_t, only one locking reader can acquire it.
+
+   .. code-block:: c
+
+	read_seqlock_excl(&foo_seqlock);
+
+	/* ... [[read-side critical section]] ... */
+
+	read_sequnlock_excl(&foo_seqlock);
+
+3. Conditional lockless reader (as in 1), or locking reader (as in 2),
+   according to a passed marker. This is used to avoid lockless readers
+   starvation (too much retry loops) in case of a sharp spike in write
+   activity. First, a lockless read is tried (even marker passed). If
+   that trial fails (odd sequence counter is returned, which is used as
+   the next iteration marker), the lockless read is transformed to a
+   full locking read and no retry loop is necessary.
+
+   .. code-block:: c
+
+	/* marker; even initialization */
+	int seq = 0;
+	do {
+		read_seqbegin_or_lock(&foo_seqlock, &seq);
+
+		/* ... [[read-side critical section]] ... */
+
+	} while (need_seqretry(&foo_seqlock, seq));
+	done_seqretry(&foo_seqlock, seq);
