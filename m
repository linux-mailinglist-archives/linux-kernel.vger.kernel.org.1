1) To who? As right now? As right now plus Torvalds, KH, Miller, etc.?
    As right now, but all-to-all?
2) Apropos "series" and "as whole"... I stumbled over
    `git log --oneline |grep -Fwe treewide`
    and am wondering:
    *Shouldn't all of these patches even begin with "treewide: "?*
    E.g.: "treewide: Replace HTTP links with HTTPS ones: GCC PLUGINS"
