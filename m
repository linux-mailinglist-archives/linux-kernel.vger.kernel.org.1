Not automatically, that is right. But it can be set if required. Seems like
the testing robots can and will test with each and every config whether they
are enabled by default or not. So if we really need to prevent all possible
testing robot regressions, X86_PAE needs to be disabled completely.

That is true. There is a slight change in the rules, making it explicit yes
only when both ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE and DEBUG_VM are enabled.

+config DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE
+	bool "Debug arch page table for semantics compliance"
+	depends on MMU
+	depends on !IA64 && !ARM
+	depends on ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE || EXPERT
+	default y if ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE && DEBUG_VM
+	help

The default is really irrelevant as the config option can be set explicitly.
