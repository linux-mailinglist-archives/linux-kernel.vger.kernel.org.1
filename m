From: SeongJae Park <sjpark@amazon.de>

DAMON[1] programming interface users can extend DAMON for any address space by
configuring the address-space specific low level primitives with appropriate
ones including their own implementations.  However, because the implementation
for the virtual address space is only available now, the users should implement
their own for other address spaces.  Worse yet, the user space users who rely
on the debugfs interface and user space tool, cannot implement their own.

This patchset implements another reference implementation of the low level
primitives for the physical memory address space.  With this change, hence, the
kernel space users can monitor both the virtual and the physical address spaces
by simply changing the configuration in the runtime.  Further, this patchset
links the implementation to the debugfs interface and the user space tool for
the user space users.

Note that the implementation supports only the user memory, as same to the idle
page access tracking feature.

Baseline and Complete Git Trees
===============================

The patches are based on the v5.7 plus DAMON v17 patchset[1] and DAMOS RFC v13
patchset[2].  You can also clone the complete git tree:

    $ git clone git://github.com/sjp38/linux -b cdamon/rfc/v5

Sequence of Patches
===================

The sequence of patches is as follow.

The first 5 patches allow the user space users manually set the monitoring
regions.  The 1st and 2nd patches implements the features in the debugfs
interface and the user space tool .  Following two patches each implement
unittests (the 3rd patch) and selftests (the 4th patch) for the new feature.
Finally, the 5th patch documents this new feature.

Following 6 patches implement the physical memory monitoring.  The 6th patch
exports rmap essential functions to GPL modules as those will be used by the
DAMON's implementation of the low level primitives for the physical memory
address space.  The 7th patch implements the low level primitives.  The 8th and
the 9th patches links the feature to the debugfs and the user space tool,
respectively.  The 10th patch further implement a handy NUMA specific memory
monitoring feature on the user space tool.  Finally, the 11th patch documents
this new features.
