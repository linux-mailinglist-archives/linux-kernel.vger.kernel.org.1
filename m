recordmcount has its own ELF wrapper code and could utilize
objtool's ELF code to more-portably handle architecture variations.
This series makes recordmcount a subcommand of objtool. It very
gradually converts recordmcount to become a subcommand of objtool and
then reuses parts of objtool's ELF code.

recordmcount maps the file in and collects simple information it needs to
append a section to the object file. The only part of the original file it
modifies is the address of new section tables -- interestingly enough this
resembles RCU in that we don't really trim the old tables so
much as unlink them via a critical offset and then rely on
future tooling, in this case, to drop the unused bits.

Much of the recordmcount ELF code is only reading and walking the data
structures to collect the mcount locations it records in a separate
area of memory. This means it's safe to mix access to the mapped
file with access to the objtool-style linked data
structures as we gradually convert it to using only the linked data
structures. Once the old ELF code is no longer in use we can drop it
and use objtool to take over the task of writing the results without
using the RCU-like trick any more.

After that we greatly simplify the mcount subcommand by adding a
few flags to the ELF reading code in objtool. Overall the series
removes about 600 lines of recordmcount while adding little to
objtool's ELF code.

Testing so far:

I've been using scripts to test cross compilation and execution of
objtool, and mcount on objects built for x86, ppc64le, arm64, s390, and
sparc.


Applies on top of:
	objtool/core

	Peter Zijlstra's "x86/entry: noinstr fixes" [2]

	Sami Tolvanen's patch enabling support for more than 64k
	sections in recordmcount, already going upstream. [3]

Changes since v4[1]:
v5:
	Updated the HAVE_C_RECORDMCOUNT Kconfig description.

	Removed unused extern is_cmd_mcount_available() spotted by Julien Thierry.

	Issue with symbol info handling reported and fixed by Kamalesh Babulal.

	Removed the giant per-supported-arch series of ifdef blocks in
	the objtool Makefile and replaced with new CONFIG_ variables
	as suggested by Julien Thierry.

	Moved the first pass through the sections into objtool's ELF
	code as suggested by Peter Zijlstra.

	Removed a redundant section lookup.

	Removed old comments that no longer apply since conversion to objtool.

v4:
	Split out recordmcount cleanups and upstreamed. [5]

	Split out, iterated on objtool multi-arch support, and upstreamed. [6]

	Split out expanded relocation support, renamed types, and functions
	to reflect expanded relocation support, and upstreamed. [4]

	This set is based on the patches sent upstream and posted above.

	Adapted to renames by Ingo and Peter: s/elf_open/elf_open_read/

	Added weak symbols for mcount subcommand
		This nicely eliminated the need for the mcount.h header.

	Added tools/objtool/Makefile per-arch SUBCMD_ blocks for each
		arch recordmcount / mcount supports.

	Moved ftrace/mcount/record.h from objtool_dep to recordmcount_dep
		This keeps the dependencies better organized.

	Fixed Makefile issue reported for PowerPC and a couple other archs
		by kbuild test robot. The always-$(BUILD_C_RECORDMCOUNT)
		line wasn't sufficiently replaced. Added to prepare-objtool
		target in top level Makefile.

	Split up dependencies to be independent of CONFIG_STACK_VALIDATION
		and CONFIG_UNWINDER_ORC since these are x86-specific.
		Now any arch which uses the C version of recordmcount
		will build objtool if dynamic tracing is enabled.

	Added a second rename at the end to be consistent with other
		objtool subcommands.

v3:
        Rebased on mainline. s/elf_open/elf_read/ in recordmcount.c

v2:
        Fix whitespace before line continuation

        Add ftrace/mcount/record.h to objtool_dep

        Rename the Makefile variable BUILD_C_RECORDMCOUNT to
            better reflect its purpose

        Similar: rename recordmcount_source => recordmcount_dep
            When using objtool we can just depend on the
            binary rather than the source the binary is
            built from. This should address Josh's feedback and
            make the Makefile code a bit clearer

        Add a comment to make reading the Makefile a little
            easier

        Rebased to latest mainline -rc
