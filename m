Yes, we have decided the boot flow at build time. Starting from the next 
release, our U-boot will use the ATF boot flow.

Per my limited knowledge in U-boot, I don't think we can follow your 
suggestion. Or it will take a lot of efforts to achieve.

I think that back compatibility is your main concern, correct? the issue 
does exist with the old boot flow and old firmware, whenever the 
customers try to use authentication. Unfortunately we can't update 
U-boot or firmware that has been released.

The authentication feature is supported only at the ATF boot flow, 
updated kernel and firmware. We will have a well-documented document to 
inform our customers that if they want to have authentication feature, 
they need to upgrade the latest U-boot, kernel and firmware.

We always encourage our customers to take the latest U-boot, kernel and 
firmware releases in their developments.
