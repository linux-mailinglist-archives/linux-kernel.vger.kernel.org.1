Sure, but clearing FSR is not writing to RESUME to resolve the stalled 
transaction(s). You can already snarf the FSR contents from your 
report_iommu_fault() handler if you want to, so either way I don't see 
what's gained by not clearing it as expected at the point where we've 
handled the *interrupt*, even if it will take longer to decide what to 
do with the underlying *fault* that it signalled. I'm particularly not 
keen on having unusual behaviour in the core interrupt handling which 
callers may unwittingly trigger, for the sake of one 
very-very-driver-specific flow having a slightly richer debugging 
experience.

For actually *handling* faults, I thought we were going to need to hook 
up the new IOPF fault queue stuff anyway?
