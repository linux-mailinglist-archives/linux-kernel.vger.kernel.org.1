The command you ran runs almost all xfstests with the test_dummy_encryption
mount option enabled, which is different from running the encryption tests --
and in fact it skips the real encryption tests, so it doesn't test the
correctness of HKDF at all.  It looks like you saw some unrelated test failures.
Sorry if I wasn't clear -- by "all tests" I meant all encryption tests, i.e.
'kvm-xfstests -c ext4 -g encrypt'.  Also, even the single test generic/582
should be sufficient to test HKDF, as I mentioned.
