I have rebased to a more recent version of linux-next. I'll make sure to
send dependency information with the next patch set. I'll also split it
into two patch sets, since the class driver has no dependencies on patches
that are in flight.

Sure - I'll create the documentation file.

The n3000 implementation of the MAX10 BMC, and eventually the d5005
implementation of the MAX10 BMC, both instantiate the MAX10 BMC Secure
Engine as a sub device. There is a dfl feature ID for the SPI interface
to the BMC, but no dfl feature ID for the secure engine itself.

Given that the security manager is dependent on other hardware and
firmware to manage the root entry hashes and to verify and program
the images, I think it is safe to say that implementations of the
security manager will always be implemented as sub devices. I can't
think of a case for giving it it's own dfl feature ID.

The class driver, of course, is an abstraction above the MAX10 BMC
implementation.

The Intel FPGA Security Manager could be used by Intel FPGA devices that
are implemented without a Device Feature List.

There are some slight differences in the implementation of the MAX10 BMC
Secure Engine between the n3000 and d5005 implementations. The d5005
support is not in the current patch set, but when it is included there
will be a different device name to indicate which code variations should
be active. Also, different platform data can be passed into the secure
engine by the parent MAX10 device if needed for new versions of the BMC.
