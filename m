Problem was that "external source" changed RTC.

But I think this is irrelevant here.

Important was state of machine. Machine was in state that had incorrect
system clock, had running NTP daemon and there was need to somehow make
system clock again correct.

And such situation may happen at any time. Either user unintentionally
change "current time" in his desktop GUI application or call "date"
application with "set" parameter (instead of get), ...

I do not thing it is too bad... When I needed to deal in userspace with
time/date/clock I just needed either "current time in UTC" to show it to
user (possible in different timezone and pretty formatted) or I needed
"timestamp since some epoch" suitable for measuring time differences.

For first case I used CLOCK_REALTIME and for second case I used
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW (as it was not affected by adjtime()).

And I would like to know, it is correct to use these two clocks in those
situations?

Now I see. Usage of external source during suspend would just lead to
another problems. So idea about CLOCK_BOOTTIME_RAW is nice but there is
no way how to provide it.

Anyway, what would happen with CLOCK_BOOTTIME when during suspend is
that external RTC source shifted back? Is kernel guarantee that
CLOCK_BOOTTIME is always monotonic even in this case?
