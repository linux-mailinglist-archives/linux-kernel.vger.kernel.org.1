Well, not really...

The execing threads will kill other other threads, then it will check
if ->sighand should be unshared. The latter is very unlikely, I don't
think CLONE_SIGHAND without CLONE_THREAD is actually used today.

But this doesn't really matter. I mean, even if you race with another
thread doing exec/exit/whatever, current->sighand is stable. Unless, again,
current has already exited (called exit_notify()).

Yes, but see above.

If tsk is not current, then (in general) it is not safe to use tsk->sighand
directly. It can can be changed by exec (as you explained), or you can hit
tsk->sighand == NULL if you race with exit.
