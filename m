I was testing this against 5.7-rc2, but I updated to linus/master and
I'm not seeing any change.

I guess the bit that worries me with the current code is in
dwc3_gadget_ep_reclaim_completed_trb():
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/usb/dwc3/gadget.c?h=v5.7-rc2#n2406

There is the logic:
  if (chain && (trb->ctrl & DWC3_TRB_CTRL_HWO))
           trb->ctrl &= ~DWC3_TRB_CTRL_HWO;

But that will never trip, as the only time we call
dwc3_gadget_ep_reclaim_completed_trb() with chain==true is from
dwc3_gadget_ep_reclaim_trb_sg():
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/usb/dwc3/gadget.c?h=v5.7-rc2#n2470

Where if the trb->ctrl has the HWO flag set, we break out before
calling  dwc3_gadget_ep_reclaim_completed_trb().

So the logic quoted above seems to be effectively dead code (despite
the big comment as to why we need it)

That's why I suspected the HWO check in
dwc3_gadget_ep_reclaim_trb_sg() is problematic.

Will do, though again, its a little tough as often we hit the stall
state pretty quickly at bootup, before I can even try to enable
tracing, so it may take a few tries.

So I didn't have any IOMMU support enabled in the config I was testing
with. I went through and added IOMMU options in my config with
linus/master as well and that didn't seem to change the behavior
either.

I'll get back to you with further trace logs.
