If you are doing this in a large scale and the oom report is really a
problem then you shouldn't be resetting hard limit to 0 in the first
place.

There are different reasons to use the hard limit. Mostly to contain
potential runaways. While high limit might be a sufficient measure to
achieve that as well the hard limit is the last resort. And it clearly
has the oom killer semantic so I am not really sure why you are
comparing the two.

This is a good question. I would have to go and double check the code
but I suspect that this is an omission.
