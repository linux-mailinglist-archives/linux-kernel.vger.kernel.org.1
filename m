(I certainly hope that this isn't a *competing* implementation. It's
more that it serves a different purpose than the existing tools.)

Right.

I did ensure that, other than the one top-level complaint that the
bitmaps overlapped, I got no complaints from e2fsck. I also confirmed
that with a patch to that one item, e2fsck passed with no issues.

I've been making *extensive* use of Documentation/filesystems/ext4 by
the way, and I greatly appreciate it. I know you've done a ton of work
in that area.

That one was on me, you're right. Because Ted is the maintainer of
e2fsprogs in Debian, and conversations about ext4 often happen in the
Debian BTS, reporting a bug on e2fsprogs there felt like starting an
upstream conversation. That was my mistake; in the future, I'll make
sure that things make it to linux-ext4. I already did so for
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=971014 , and I
*should* have gone back and done so for the shared bitmap blocks issue.

Understood, agreed, and acknowledged. I'll make sure that any future
potentially "adventurous" filesystem experiments get discussed on
linux-ext4 first, not just in a distro bugtracker with a limited
audience.

That's a fair point (though I think a writable COW version of
SHARED_BLOCKS would need a different flag). It'd make more sense to key
this logic off of RO_COMPAT_READONLY or similar. But even better:

Yeah, I can do that. That's a much better solution, thank you. It would
have been problematic to have to change the userspace that mounts the
filesystem to pass new mount options ("noblock_validity") for the new
kernel. But if I can embed it in the filesystem, that'll work.

I'll do that, and please feel free to drop the original proposed patch
as it's no longer needed. Thanks, Darrick.
