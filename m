So what we are looking at, at salepoints for an optimal nix machine is:

- 48bit Graphics
- LCPU - Library Accelerated CPU, for low latency and jitter.
- 4K / 8K subpixels resolution.

- name sdX, as supply and demand is a monotheistic principle of a 
perfected nix name.

With realtime audio being a real and valid option here, with fast 
reponse <0.5ms, like Amiga once was for the Trance genre. And Amiga was 
nix inspired.
And really the available source nix is a similar crowd now.
