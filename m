Just FYI, the timeouts in SCMI can be platform specific. So each platform
have flexibility to choose it's own choice of timeout and need not be
stuck with so called *Juno values".

The architects of SCMI believe the transfers(especially DVFS) must not exceed
few 100s of uS and worst case for any transfers must be few ms. My initial
choice of 30ms was based on the jiffes based timer and 100Hz. Architect claim
that is too much, but I thought 3 jiffies at minimum in case we start timer
when we are close to the boundaries.

No disagreement on the latter part. But we can't ignore the bottlenecks
even if they are rare.
