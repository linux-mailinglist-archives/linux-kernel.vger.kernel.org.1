Even if we were to do this, the worst-case stack usage on the largest
systems might be an issue.  If it isn't then we might as well hard-wire
it to 31 elements anyway,

I dunno.  An extra 128 bytes of stack doesn't sound toooo bad, and the
performance benefit is significant.  Perhaps we just go with the
original patch.  If there are any on-stack pagevecs in the page reclaim
path then perhaps we could create a new mini-pagevec for just those.  or
look at simply removing the pagevec optimization in there altogether.
