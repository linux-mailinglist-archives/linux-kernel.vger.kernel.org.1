Yes, this matches Andy's feedback, will add.

Oh, good to know will make that change.

True, yes, the intent was "don't break userspace" for terminology replacement.

Sounds good to me.

I agree with this statement and am interested in getting connected to
those conversations, but this may be a bit too much advocacy to expect
in kernel documentation.
