We are trying to use the driver_override for similar purposes on FPGA.
The FPGA card could be reprogramed with a newly developed Hardware
component by users. Sometimes only the FPGA users know which dfl device
they want to operate on. This is why we give the option to users for
direct I/O access.

Also FPGA users have the requirement for diagnostic of the newly
developed components.

It is possible we define an id_table for dfl_uio_pdev driver, but then
users have to modify the driver code everytime they create & reprogram
a new HW component.

Sorry I didn't have much knowledge on this.
Does the sysfs 'driver_override' or 'new_id' have problems, or the
userspace direct I/O access mechanism (UIO/VFIO) has problems?

If it is the former, I could consider some other way to generate the UIO
devices for DFL. But could you help specify more about the issues?

Thanks very much,
Yilun
