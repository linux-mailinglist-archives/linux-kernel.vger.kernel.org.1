The OF_MFD_CELL() entry handles all of the existing .dts source files
that only have one ab8500-pwm child nodes.  So existing .dtb blobs
continue to work.

The OF_MFD_CELL_REG() entries will handle all of the new .dts source
files that will have up to 3 ab8500-pwm child nodes.

Compatibility is maintained for existing .dtb files.  A new kernel
version with the changes will support new .dtb files that contain
multiple ab8500-pwm child nodes.

Based on reading the patch description, I expected some extra code to try
to handle the case where the compatible in more than one struct mfd_cell
entry is "stericsson,ab8500-pwm" and there are multiple ab8500-pwm child
nodes.

Looking at the actual code (which I had not done before), I see that the
"best effort attempt to match" is keeping a list of child nodes that
have already been used (mfd_of_node_list) and avoiding re-use of such
nodes.  This allows an invalid .dtb (one with multple "stericsson,ab8500-pwm"
child nodes) to possibly be assigned unique child nodes for multiple
struct mfd_cell entries to be "stericsson,ab8500-pwm".

So it is confusing for me to call that "fallback code".  It really is
"best effort attempt to match" for a broken .dtb code.

There should be no best effort for a broken .dtb.  The broken .dtb should
instead result in an error.
