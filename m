Well, there are other CI's beyond syzbot .. Does syzbot only build/test
a single kernel arch/config?

Of course that could be done if I knew that there were problems.  From
memory and my mail archives, I was only cc'd on 3 problems by sysbot
since last November and they were all responded to by the appropriate
maintainers/developers.

Currently, when I am cc'd on reports, if they are also sent to who
seem like the appropriate people, I just file the report assuming it
will be dealt with.

That may be true, but in some cases I have carried fixups/reverts/older
versions of trees for quite some time before things get fixed.  But at
least if that happens, I do tend to remind people.
