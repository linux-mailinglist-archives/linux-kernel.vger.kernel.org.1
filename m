The downside is that anyone can easily mess with the chip. That does make
me quite concerned - I have seen many PMBus chips and even boards blown up
if misconfigured. It is bad enough that this can be done in the first place,
but I don't want to make it even easier by providing the means to do so via
debugfs files.

Did you try with an application sending ioctls directly ? That should
be much less error prone than i2cset/i2cget. Also, a userspace process
like this should have appropriate priorities (ie run as realtime process)
to avoid being preempted.

Thanks,
