No, I mean here is the code after this patch is applied:

	for (;;) {
		if (data_race(prev->next) == node &&
		    cmpxchg(&prev->next, node, NULL) == node)
			break;

		/*
		 * We can only fail the cmpxchg() racing against an unlock(),
		 * in which case we should observe @node->locked becomming
		 * true.
		 */
		if (smp_load_acquire(&node->locked))
			return true;

		cpu_relax();

		/*
		 * Or we race against a concurrent unqueue()'s step-B, in which
		 * case its step-C will write us a new @node->prev pointer.
		 */
		prev = READ_ONCE(node->prev);
	}

I'm saying that this READ_ONCE at the end of the loop should be sufficient
to stop the compiler making value assumptions about prev->next. Do you
agree?
