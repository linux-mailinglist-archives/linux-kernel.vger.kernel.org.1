If you look around, there are currently several versions of mcp251x
driver around, shipped by hardware vendors who glue the chip on there
SOM etc.
Until something more-or-less clean becomes mainline, the effort remains
spread.

A problem to import a complete driver is that ... its complete.
There was an suggestion to split into several patches, but that does not
really affect the review work.

The original driver failed to initialize under a loaded CAN bus, on my
desk. The current driver is more cleanly written than the original
and it seems to survive more than 1 use case (although I have a MAB overflow
report pending to investigate).
So, this is a good candidate for mainline.

Kind regards,
Kurt
