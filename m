Is any of you familiar with Golang?

@Maintainers Would any of you actually review like this? If yes, is the 
pseudo-code not enough?

I didn't log that link-by-link. Maybe because I also didn't follow plain 
HTTP redirects while opening HTTPS links. Maybe it even matched, but was 
added after I made the changes.

Anyway, I'll maybe cover it in round II.

There are two reasons:

* Jonathan said like theoretically you could give it all at once to 
Linus, but practically I'd not do that, please split by subsystem
* Linus *didn't even respond* (at least I didn't receive anything) to my 
catch-them-all patch at all, not even like please not as .gz attachment 
or please split by subsystem
