Work on this driver started back in 2018, that was indeed the last decade.

Not sure this makes sense, given that the DMA hardware that was added to
this UART block is only used by the UART block and no other pieces of HW
in the system, nor will they ever be. Not sure it makes sense to pay the
cost of an extra indirection and subsystem unless there are at least two
consumers of that DMA hardware to warrant modeling it after a dmaengine
driver. I also remember that Al researched before whether 8250_dma.c
could work, and came to the conclusion that it would not, but I will let
him comment on the specifics.

See previous response.
