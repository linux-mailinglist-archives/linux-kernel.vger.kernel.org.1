I took a look at is_visible(). It only makes sense for a group of
attributes that are exposed in a sub directory. But state_synced is a
top level property IMO. What I'm doing is similar to the "online"
attribute that's exposed for a device.

And even if I create a group with one lone attribute, I'll still have
to add it after the device has probed or have to call
sysfs_update_groups() after the device is probed to update the
visibility. Seems quite messy and unnecessarily complicated.

I'd like to keep this an attribute and not create a group for that
reason. Does that sound okay to you? I'll obviously still do the clean
up correctly.
