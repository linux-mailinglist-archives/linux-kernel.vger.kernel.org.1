Right, I think cpusets provide exactly.

When cpusets are set as exclusive, they become strict CPU properties.
I think we'll need to enforce the exclusive property to set the isolated
flags.

Then you're free to move the tasks you like into any isolated cpusets.

Yep, could be a solution.

Exactly. I guess we can simply call directly to subsystems (timers,
workqueue, kthreads, ...) from the isolation code upon cpumask update.
This way we avoid ordering surprises that would come with a notifier.

Right but you would still have all the overhead that comes with nohz full
(kernel entry/exit tracking, RCU userspace extended grace period, RCU callbacks
offloaded, vtime accounting, ...). It will become really interesting once we
can switch all that overhead off.

Thanks.
