Hi Rob, Arnd and Jassi,

This stuff has been doing rounds on the mailing list since several years
now with no agreed conclusion by all the parties. And here is another
attempt to get some feedback from everyone involved to close this once
and for ever. Your comments will very much be appreciated.

The ARM MHU is defined here in the TRM [1] for your reference, which
states following:

	"The MHU drives the signal using a 32-bit register, with all 32
	bits logically ORed together. The MHU provides a set of
	registers to enable software to set, clear, and check the status
	of each of the bits of this register independently.  The use of
	32 bits for each interrupt line enables software to provide more
	information about the source of the interrupt. For example, each
	bit of the register can be associated with a type of event that
	can contribute to raising the interrupt."

On few other platforms, like qcom, similar doorbell mechanism is present
with separate interrupt for each of the bits (that's how I understood
it), while in case of ARM MHU, there is a single interrupt line for all
the 32 bits. Also in case of ARM MHU, these registers and interrupts
have 3 copies for different priority levels, i.e. low priority
non-secure, high priority non-secure and secure channels.

For ARM MHU, both the dt bindings and the Linux driver support 3
channels for the different priorities right now and support sending a 32
bit data on every transfer in a locked fashion, i.e. only one transfer
can be done at once and the other have to wait for it to finish first.

Here are the point of view of the parties involved on this subject:

Jassi's viewpoint:

- Virtualization of channels should be discouraged in software based on
  specific usecases of the application. This may invite other mailbox
  driver authors to ask for doing virtualization in their drivers.

- In mailbox's terminology, every channel is equivalent to a signal,
  since there is only one signal generated here by the MHU, there should
  be only one channel per priority level.

- The clients should send data (of just setting 1 bit or many in the 32
  bit word) using the existing mechanism as the delays due to
  serialization shouldn't be significant anyway.

- The driver supports 90% of the users with the current implementation
  and it shouldn't be extended to support doorbell and implement two
  different modes by changing value of #mbox-cells field in bindings.

Sudeep (ARM) and myself as well to some extent:

- The hardware gives us the capability to write the register in
  parallel, i.e. we can write 0x800 and 0x400 together without any
  software locks, and so these 32 bits should be considered as separate
  channel even if only one interrupt is issued by the hardware finally.
  This shouldn't be called as virtualization of the channels, as the
  hardware supports this (as clearly mentioned in the TRM) and it takes
  care of handling the signal properly.

- With serialization, if we use only one channel as today at every
  priority, if there are 5 requests to send signal to the receiver and
  the dvfs request is the last one in queue (which may be called from
  scheduler's hot path with fast switching), it unnecessarily needs to
  wait for the first four transfers to finish due to the software
  locking imposed by the mailbox framework. This adds additional delay,
  maybe of few ms only, which isn't required by the hardware but just by
  the software and few ms can be important in scheduler's hotpath.

- With the current approach it isn't possible to assign different bits
  (or doorbell numbers) to clients from DT and the only way of doing
  that without adding new bindings is by extending #mbox-cells to accept
  a value of 2 as done in this patch.

Jassi and Sudeep, I hope I was able to represent both the view points
properly here. Please correct me if I have made a mistake here.

This is it. It would be nice to get the views of everyone now on this
and how should this be handled.

Thanks.
