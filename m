Looking back through the lore history, I don't know where the 
IOVA_FQ_SIZE = 256 came from. I guess it's size of 2x IOVA_MAG_SIZE (1x 
for loaded and 1x for prev) for the reason you mention.

As you may have seen:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hisilicon/kernel-dev/064c4dc8869b3f2ad07edffceafde0b129f276b0/lsi3008_dmesg

I had to change some block configs via sysfs to ever get IOVA locations 
for size > 0. And even then, I still got none bigger than 
IOVA_RANGE_CACHE_MAX_SIZE.

Note: For a log like:
[13175.361915] print_iova2 iova_allocs(=5000000 ... too_big=47036

47036 is number of IOVA size > IOVA_RANGE_CACHE_MAX_SIZE, in case it was 
not clear.

And I never hit the critical point of a depot bin filling, but it may 
just take even longer.

However with IOVA size = 0 always occurring, then I noticed that the 
depot size = 0 bin fills up relatively quickly. As such, I am now 
slightly skeptical of the approach I have taken here, i.e purge the 
whole rcache.

So do you think that the freeing the IOVA magazines when the depot fills 
is the cause of this? That was our analysis.

Not sure on that one.

Yeah, I tend to agree with that. Or, more specifically, how things work 
today is broken, and MAX_GLOBAL_MAGS = 32 is very much involved with that.

So I said that it should fix the problem of the throughput going through 
the floor at this 16h mark.

But we see 2x tightly coupled problems:
a. leading up to the ~16H critical point, throughput is slowly degrading 
and becomes quite unstable (not shown in the log)
For the LSI3008 card, we don't see that. But then no IOVA size > 
IOVA_RANGE_CACHE_MAX_SIZE occur there.

b. at the critical point, throughput goes through the floor

So b. should be fixed with the suggestion to have unlimited/higher depot 
max bin size, but I reckon that we would still see a. And I put that 
down to the fact that we have IOVA sizes > IOVA_RANGE_CACHE_MAX_SIZE at 
a certain rate always. As the rb tree grows over time, they become 
slower and slower to alloc+free - that's our theory. Allowing the depot 
to grow further isnâ€™t going to help that.

Maybe Leizhen's idea to trim the rcache periodically is overall better, 
but I am concerned on implementation.

If not, then if we allow depot bin size to scale/grow, I would like to 
see more efficient handling for IOVA size > IOVA_RANGE_CACHE_MAX_SIZE.

Thanks,
John
