Alright I reverted the previous changes and switched us to use
PTRACE_SETREGSET with NT_PRSTATUS[0] and our 32 bit tests pass again.
I assume this behavior will remain unchanged indefinitely even when
the fs/gsbase manipulation instructions are not available since the 32
bit user_regs_struct can't grow?

3a6e30#diff-b509a7939392c11bb3c517b00da4526fL1447
(most of the rest of this commit is fixing our *emulation* of
PTRACE_GETREGSET/PTRACE_SETREGSET which was not respecting the
tracee's 32 vs 64 bit stauts).
