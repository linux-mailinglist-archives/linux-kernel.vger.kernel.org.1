So, we have here a problem and my commit is indeed revealed it since it's
basically did spread of what we used to have only in two drivers (and
originally reported problem was against third one, i.e. 8250_pnp) to all 8250.
Even if we revert that commit, we got the other problem appear, hence it's a
matter who to suffer until the clean solution will be provided.

As per earlier discussion [1] (and I Cc'ed this to people from there) it
appears there is another issue with RT kernels which brought initially that
controversial disable_irq_nosync() call. Same here, if we drop this call
somebody will be unsatisfied.

The real fix possible to go to completely lockless printk(), but on the other
hand it probably won't prevent other locking corner cases (dead lock?) in 8250
console write callback.

The fix proposed in [2] perhaps not the way to go either...

The idea about not allowing disabling IRQ for console port may be least
painful as a (temporary?) mitigation.
