This is NAND its own problem, if no significant adantage, I don't think
it's a good solution to extend the problem to the upper FS layer.
also, in the FS erase path, doesn't have the programmed pages counter.
we should repeat the same approach as we did in MTD layer.

sorry for my fault, I thought adding your Signed-off-by in 3/5 is
suffient. you mean I should add your signed-off-by in 5/5 as well?
I will do that in next version.

thanks Miquel.


BTW: would you please help me review other code?
