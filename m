Why do they need to be exclusive?  We've already established that BLD catches
things that SLD does not.  What's wrong with running sld=fatal and bld=ratelimit
so that split locks never happen and kill applications, and non-WB locks are
are ratelimited?

Sure, sld==warn with bld!=off is a bit silly, but the kernel can easily handle
that particular case.

Split locks are fatal, non-WB locks are logged but not fatal.

Honestly, it seems less complex than deciphering the resulting behavior from
that table.

  sld=off|warn|fatal
  bld=off|warn|ratelimit

As above, sld then could become

  if (sld == warn && bld != off) {
          pr_warn("disabling SLD in favor of BLD\n");
          sld = off;
  }

Everything else should simply work.  The necessary refactoring for SLD should
be minimial as well.
