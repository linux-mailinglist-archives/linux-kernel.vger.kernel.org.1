Sounds fine to me.  I was mostly looking for a high level idea of what
was happening here.  I am at least a little curious about the
retention bit.  Is that retention during S3, or during some sort of
Runtime PM?  Any idea how much power is burned?  Unless the power is
miniscule it seems hard to believe that it would be a net win to keep
a cache powered up during S3 unless you're planning on waking up a
lot.
