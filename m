Sorry, I did it as slowly as I could possibly do.
I wanted to wait for you, but....

That worries me a bit.
Could you please share details of the failed attempts with us,
Leaning from failures could help us better understand the issue.

Also here, it might help to make us aware of the problems you face.

I also considered moving all the credentials to the inner block,
but had the impression that is probably a really tough problem instead.

I wondered what happens if a ptraced execve process executes a
suid program that is.  Don't you need different credentials
when you are pthraced, I mean, doesn't that override the suid bit,
while when not ptraced, you be root user, and have all the root
powers to load the image in the new vm?

Isn't there a race when execve starts, and ptrace attach happens later?


Thanks
Bernd.
