Hi, that's true, hest_disable is added by default to reduce memory
usage in special cases.
But even if I remove hest_disable and have GHES enabled, but the
hanging issue still exists, from the iLO console log, it's still
sending an NMI to kernel, and kernel hanged.

The NMI won't hang the kernel for 100 percent, sometime it will just
panic and reboot and sometimes it hangs. This behavior didn't change
after/before enabled the GHES.

Maybe this is a "special platform behavior". I'm also not 100 percent
sure if/how we can cover this in a good way for now.
I'll try to figure how the NMI actually hanged the kernel and see if
it could be fixed in other ways.
