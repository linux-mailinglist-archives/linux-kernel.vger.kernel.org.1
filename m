This the same mistake I've done.

schedutil_cpu_util() is called by sugov_get_util() passing p as NULL.

292 static unsigned long sugov_get_util(struct sugov_cpu *sg_cpu)                                                                                                                                               
293 {                                                                               
294         struct rq *rq = cpu_rq(sg_cpu->cpu);                                    
295         unsigned long util = cpu_util_cfs(rq);                                  
296         unsigned long max = arch_scale_cpu_capacity(sg_cpu->cpu);               
297                                                                                 
298         sg_cpu->max = max;                                                      
299         sg_cpu->bw_dl = cpu_bw_dl(rq);                                          
300                                                                                 
301         return schedutil_cpu_util(sg_cpu->cpu, util, max, FREQUENCY_UTIL, NULL);
302 }

So this will not fix the problem with RT tasks and we have to do the check
at schedutil which is the right abstraction layer anyway. I don't think calling
rq_rt_is_runnable() is right here and is unnecessary duplication since
schedutil will still have to do that anyway.

When p is not NULL then the function will work correctly in regards to
uclamp_eff_get() returning the right value, including the default settings.
Which is important when my patch to introduce sysctl for default RT boosting
comes into play.

The function deserves a comment for sure though so that users are aware that
the function will not be useful if the static key is disabled. There's no
aggregation done at rq level and this can certainly catch people out.

We can add a static key to return util directly too. I might just do this since
it might help with readability.

Please shout if I missed something.

IMHO this is a bug not an optimization. We have to write to these struct
anyway, so why not write the right value to start with? This already caught me
out and wasted over half a day trying to chase it.

Beside what are we optimizing for here? I think correctness dictates we start
with correct initial values if we can, no? How are you expecting this to slow
down sched_init()?
