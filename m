So your proposal is to manage the tty devices throught the rpmsg_char. 

Look to me that we have two use cases here:
1) offer a standard tty device to allows application to communicate with
the remote firmware:
 - allow to use "standard application such as terminal tools,
 - keep application compatibility to communicate with an external processor
 through a serial link or with an co processor through rpmsg.
 - take benefice of the line discipline management uses by applications.
=> need an "auto" probe of the tty device

2) Expose the channels to the userland without devices. This would
be the role of the rpmsg_char probed by the virtio rpmsg.
=> application manages the channels using the char device.
=> only the application has the notion of the service associated to the channel.

Look to me that correlate both would be not flexible. 
I would keep rpmsg_char device channel service agnostic, and let application
manage the service.
In this case it would a design choice to support the service trough the TTY
interface or the rpmsg char device interface.

Agree, the rpmsg char device is very interesting for this. Today the alternative
is to implement RPMsg in userland using the OpenAMP library.

No my point here is that we have also on shelves an rpmsg_i2c and an rpmsg_spi
drivers to manage in the same way a virtual i2c[1] and a virtual SPI with
the possibility to have Linux client drivers and/or userland interface.

So extend rpmsg_char to create a tty device in addition could be the first
step of the support of a lot of in-kernel and/or userland interfaces.

IMO both have to be considered in parallel and should not be correlated as far as
possible. Extend the char device to decouple the system from the naming this seems to me a
good solution but another topic.

That said, I may not fully understand your approach. Please don't hesitate to correct me.

In any case, I cannot/will not go ahead with this implementation without your agreement.
So, please, could you tell me if an rpmsg_tty is acceptable from your point of view or if
you consider that it is mandatory to implement the tty device in rpmsg_char.

Thanks,
Arnaud
