Yes, that's what I was thinking too - most of these uses are just 
passing them in and out of the DMA APIs, and thus would be subsumed into 
the wrappers anyway, then in the relatively few remaining places where 
the table is actually iterated for one reason or the other, renaming 
would stand to help review and maintenance in terms of making it far 
more obvious when the implementation and the intent don't match.
