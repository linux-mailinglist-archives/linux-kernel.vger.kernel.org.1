Please read "Why my CONFIG symbol is (not) special?"...

They still depend on the feature under test, which may not be enabled.

While I'm a strong supporter of testing, this select is what I object
to, as it forces the enablement of features that were not enabled in
your kernel in the first place.

If you want to test e.g. EXT4, sure you know you should enable EXT4?
If you don't enable feature FOO in your kernel. why would you be
interested in testing feature FOO? Unless you want to test everything,
and you might as well run an allmodconfig kernel.

Providing .config snippets containing both the CONFIG_FOO_KUNIT_TESTS
and CONFIG_FOO symbols set (and other dependencies, if needed) could
provide this, and would also be useful in documenting CONFIG_FOO has a
corresponding tests.

As kunit can be modular, and most tests can be modular too, I can build
all tests relevant for my system as modules.  Hence they are available
when the need to run them ever arises, while there is no further impact
on my system. This use case also seems to be supported by
CONFIG_KUNIT_ALL_TESTS:

    config KUNIT_ALL_TESTS
            tristate "All KUnit tests with satisfied dependencies"
            help
              Enables all KUnit tests, if they can be enabled.

However, this no longer works if this suddenly starts enabling random
features in my kernel, which was the case for EXT4_KUNIT_TESTS
and MPTCP_KUNIT_TESTS (enables MPTCP, and IPV6!).

While ext4 is ubiquitous (I did have it enabled ;-) and may be
considered common on all systems (it is not: e.g. embedded systems with
JFFS do not need EXT4 enabled), this is surely not the case for other
features with tests, and won't be the case for all features that will
receive kunit tests in the future.

Thanks for your understanding!
