The flag isn't documented very well yet, but since it specifically
forces the filesystem to always be mounted read-only, the bitmaps really
shouldn't matter at all. (In an ideal world, a permanently read-only
filesystem should be able to omit all the bitmaps entirely. Pointing
them all to a single disk block is the next best thing.)

I pretty much had to sort it out by looking at a combination of
e2fsprogs and the kernel, and a lot of experimentation, until I ended up
with something that the kernel was completely happy with without a
single complaint.

I'd be happy to write up a summary of the format.

I'd still really like to see this patch applied for 5.9, to avoid having
filesystems that an old kernel can mount but a new one can't. This still
seems like a regression to me.

Yes.

If you set up the rest of the metadata consistently with it (for
instance, 0 free blocks and 0 free inodes), you'll only get a single
complaint, from the e2fsck equivalent of block_validity. See
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=956509 for details on
that; with that fixed, e2fsck wouldn't complain at all. The kernel,
prior to 5.9-rc2, doesn't have a single complaint, whether at mount,
unmount, or read of every file and directory on the filesystem.

The errors you got in your e2fsck run came because you just overrode the
bitmaps, but didn't make the rest of the metadata consistent with that.
I can provide a sample filesystem if that would help.
