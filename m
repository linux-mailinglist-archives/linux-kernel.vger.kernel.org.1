This is I think the first time anyone has suggested that this is likely
to be an issue - the previous concerns have all been about screens
glitching.

At the minute we implement any requested changes immediately.

That seems fine given that there appears to be no reason to introduce a
delay.

So this is to support some future change that you either haven't
written or haven't sent out yet.  Please don't do stuff like this, it
makes everything more confusing.  Send out isolated, coherent changes
that do a single thing per patch, if there's things you're thinking of
for future work then save them for when you actually do that future
work.  That makes everything clearer and easier to follow.

My concern is that introducing extra delays is likely to make things
more fragile and complex.  As far as I can see this is just making
things even worse by adding spurious dependencies and delaying things
further.

Other users exist and need to be considered.  People need to be able to
run upstream kernels, they need to be able to run distros and other
systems that aren't vertically integrated like yours where people aren't
developing the DT and kernel together.

Possibly.

No, it's not a typo - "make work" is busy work for the sake of it.  I'm
saying that this is just requiring a mechanical update in all drivers
both now and going forwards which is exactly the sort of thing we should
be factoring out of drivers.

To repeat what I said at the time a device that's in multiple frameworks
like this is most likely a MFD with a bunch of broadly unrelated things
in it, where things are related we need to track those dependencies
anyway.  At best this is working around a problem that has been
introduced by the decision to do everything at far too broad a level,
it feels like it's defeating the point of trying to track dependencies
at all.  The whole performance seems completely redundant if we're
trying to aggregate things so aggressively, we end up needing pretty
much every device in the system to come up before we can do anything.
Together with the late_initcall() stuff this is sounding like what it's
really doing is going a very long way around introducing a new initcall
that gets triggered after all modules are loaded (which *was* one of the
earlier suggestions).

I really think this would be a lot simpler and easier for all concerned
if it operated per regulator like the changelog originally seemed to
suggest.
