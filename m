I don't understand what you mean here. How do *you* find the device if the
device-id is 0xffff?

My impression was that the spi-nor host is not a PCI device at all
but instead is a function on the mfd device, and probed as a
platform_driver with the "intel-spi" name.

Config space of *which* device in particular? Is this the Atom MFD device,
the SPI-NOR host, or something else?

Is this MMIO space part of a PCI device BAR, or how do you find it?
If it belongs to a PCI device, which one is this, and why can't there
be a driver for it?

Maybe try adding an interface to one of the drivers at first, and then extend
it to the other hardware after an initial code review. Do not bypass the driver
model or try to do everything at once with a single module that knows
details of multiple unrelated hardware implementations.
