Does this or any of the proposed patches regress anything for GCC?  Do
they regress anything for Clang?  Is it a regression if it never
worked in the first place? ;)

Disabling things isn't crossing the finish line.  It's admitting where
your weaknesses lie, and where you need to improve.  Crossing the
finish line is implementing and filling out those weaknesses.  We're
running a race we're behind by 10 years! We may never catch up!

We need to disable configs that we know are broken when using certain
LLVM tools until we can dedicate more resources to fixing them.  This
prevents curious failures when doing randconfig builds, which some of
the CI systems do.  It then gives us a nice list we can grep for
configs we need to fix, whether that's via improvements to the
toolchain to changes to the source.  And I think Arnd agreed with me
when he said "It clearly makes sense to limit the Kconfig option to
compilers that can actually build it."

I don't think we have a long list of configs to mark broken; it's not
like we're flooding the list with patches marking tons of things
broken.

In my town where I live, they spray paint the sidewalks that need
repair so that people don't trip.  "Why not just replace the
sidewalk?" you might ask.  Eventually they do, but it takes much more
time and effort, and there are a lot more broken sidewalks than people
and money to repair them.  Was it a waste to highlight the areas where
people might trip?

All I'm suggesting is that we mark the way for future travelers that
this doesn't work, as you'll get a potentially very confusing error
message if you try.  Then `git log` probably has a Link: and more
context as to why.  Then you can `grep` for all of the places that are
broken, and figure out which sidewalk is most important to repair
first, and better estimate the cost to repair all of them.

No; it allows us to not even install binutils on the host, and know
that the Clang assembler and only the Clang assembler is being used;
no other host utilities that happen to be in the $PATH.

When I do a build with any LLVM utility, I'd like to ensure that the
equivalent from binutils isn't invoked.  This is something folks can
already start testing today with multiple installs of GNU or LLVM
utilities, though I don't know of anyone leading a conscious effort.
This is something we've been finding the hard way; we've been doing
builds on hosts with no GCC/binutils, and finding places where as an
example `nm` or `objcopy` is hardcoded, rather than
`$(NM)`/`$(OBCOPY)`, which is the first step towards making the build
more hermetic.

The next step is ensuring the tools produce deterministic output,
which is quite painful.

If LLVM improves, thanks to efforts to support the Linux kernel, then
I'd call that a win that kernel developers can celebrate.

I think if anyone on this thread had the position that "_all_ legacy
needs to die," then no one here would have anything to work on. :P
