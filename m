I don't think I was too closely involved in these numbers on rk3399,
but as far as I can tell the 100 number came from:

https://crrev.com/c/364003

...interestingly enough the number _wasn't_ scaled to 100 (but was a
number close to 100) and then was changed to scale to 100.  That makes
it seem like 100, though awfully round, was at least based loosely on
fact for rk3399.

In any case, the devicetree bindings make it pretty clear that this
value should be based in reality and not some bogus number.

Right, I was going to say that.  Specifically:

* Anyone that actually gets one of these chips can just measure it
pretty trivially.  Run the core at a certain speed and measure with
the smart battery.  Run at a different speed and measure again.

* Presumably the power consumption of different types of cores in
Qualcomm SoCs of the same generation is roughly equivalent.  So I
could go and grab a Pixel 4a and put AOSP on it and measure the power
consumption and presumably get pretty close numbers for big and little
power coefficients.  I don't know for sure if Pixel 4a's SoC is
officially the same generation but I'd bet it's close.

* Presumably someone would be able to get a pretty good guess by
figuring out the form factor and working backwards.  It sounds as if
thermal dissipation (in terms of Watts) for various form factor
devices is somewhat standard.  Maybe this is more so for phones /
tablets than laptops which might have bigger heat pipes or active
cooling, but still.  Someone could do the math pretty easily.

I guess if you're really worried about protecting this then you can
delay posting it for brand new chipsets using a new type of technology
until product is almost ready to ship, but for sc7180 it doesn't feel
like this is something worth fighting about.
