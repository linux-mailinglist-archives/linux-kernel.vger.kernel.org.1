as per discussion on IRC, I have separated the parts of this change 
which are
unrelated to compliance and we have merged it to the base DP driver and 
added
the Co-developed-by tag there. Since this change adds supports for DP 
compliance
on MSM chipsets which is a new feature and not fixes to the base driver, 
we will
prefer to have this as a separate change as it will make it easier for 
you to
review it instead of continuing to expand the base DP driver
