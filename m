For the record and for whatever it is worth at this point.  The patch
has been available in its present form and function for around 14
months.

So there was plenty of time for its consideration and integration into
what is being prepared as the final merge candidate.

That would be a very low cost and forward looking addition.

All well taken technical points, but they don't speak directly to the
issue at hand.  The potential security issue in all of this is access
to /dev/sgx/enclave, not the EPC tracking and core code.

Here in a nutshell is the paradox the kernel faces:

No one seems to be disputing the fact that the primary focus of this
driver will be to support the notion of 'runtime encryption' and
Confidential Computing.  The whole premise of the concept and economic
predicate of the initiative is that the owner/manager of the platform
has no visibility into what is being done on the platform.

If the Linux community believes that standard platform security
controls can make qualitatively good judgements on what enclave based
execution is doing, it is effectively making the statement that the
very concept of runtime encryption and by extension Confidential
Computing is invalid.

If we accept the concept that Confidential Computing is valid then we
admit the technology provides the opportunity for unsupervised code
execution and data manipulation.

Our premise in all of this is that one page of code implementing three
linked lists is a small price to pay to provide platform owners with
the opportunity to optionally implement what is effectively 2-factor
authentication over this process.

Going forward, if we are intellectually honest, all of this suggests
that adding complexity to the driver with LSM controls makes little
sense technically.  Since, by definition and economic intent, the
technology provides tools and infrastructure that allows these
controls to be evaded.

The notion that entities with adversarial intent would not try and
take advantage of this flies in the face of everything we know about
security.

It appears that the distributions, at least IBM/RHEL, are going to
compile this driver in and backport it as well.

What we would recommend at this point is that you and Jarkko do the
Linux community and beyond a favor and wire up a simple kernel
command-line parameter that controls the ability of the driver to be
used, ie. enables/disables access to /dev/sgx/enclave.

Distributions or others can set this command-line parameter by default
to 'disable' and avoid any possibility of the technology being used
for nefarious purposes.  Since the technology now appears to be
focused only on the cloud providers they will certainly be capable of
configuring their implementations to change the default.

In essence, make the kernel's behavior secure by default.

Best wishes for a pleasant weekend to everyone.
