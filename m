It is absolutely bonkers, but at the same time we can extend this
infrastructure to scan for dubious code patterns we don't want to
support. Like for instance direct manipulation of CR4.

Look at is as another layer to enforce sanity on binary only modules.

Do we want to go that way, and do you know of other code patterns you'd
want to fail module loading for?
