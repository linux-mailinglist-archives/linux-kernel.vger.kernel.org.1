Which explicitly mentioned above in the patch's description:

This can't work when hot unplugging a memory slot because the memory slot
is flagged as invalid and gfn_to_pfn() is then not trying to access the
page, so the page fault mechanism is not triggered.

This is probably doable. At the time I wrote that patch, the 
kvmppc_memslot_page_merge() was not yet introduced AFAIR.

This being said, I'd help a lot to factorize that code... I let Ram dealing with 
that ;)

Laurent.
