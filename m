Since this really does seem to be a tail-call and since x16 and x17
appear to be otherwise unused here, can we not just use x16 or x17
instead of x7?

This relies on there being no other calls to veneered functions in the
mix, but this code is all in a single section so that shouldn't be a
concern.

Due to the magic status of x16 and x17 in br instructions, the resulting
jump should be compatible with BTI c.  I think this matches how the
compiler should typically compile tail-calls.

Cheers
