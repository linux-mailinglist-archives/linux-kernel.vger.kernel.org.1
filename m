OK.

I find it more helpful to see these critical definitions directly above
the loop. When I add them to the variable declarations, I find it really
ugly and hard to reference. Maybe you could show me an example of what
you want it to look like?

Agreed.

You are correct.

Yes, I like how you switched the checks. Also, the second check can be
nested inside the first one.

However, the "line_len > text_len" check will not work here because
text_len is unsigned and could underflow with this logic. I think doing
the math twice (as I did) is the simplest.

I agree that the code is quite tricky here. I will refactor as you have
suggested.

What does the logbuf_lock have to do with this? What does this have to
do with reserving extra space? We are modifying the reader's buffer
in-place, not the datablock data.

Your suggestions to simplify are good.

Again, I do not understand what this has to do with the
lockbuf_lock. Please explain.

Below is how I would like to implement record_print_text() after
incorporating your suggestions. Please show me how you would like to see
the important variable role comments formatted. Thanks.
