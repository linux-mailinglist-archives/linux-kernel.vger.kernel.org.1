I caught a few lockdep complaints that suggest otherwise, but I'm still
looking into that.

This part I understand and this is what ww_mutex should take care of.
But there is another lock that's taken around ww_mutex locking transaction
that causes the trouble. I would expect that the rdev->mutex should be
enough to guard against changes in coupled regulators list, but this
might need a fix in the registration phase to guarantee that (it
probably should do the same ww_mutex locking dance as .._lock_dependent()
does now).
