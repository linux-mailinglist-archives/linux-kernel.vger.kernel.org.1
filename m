I think the updated example handles this grouping (port@1 going to a
"SS mux") although as you said it should probably be a group of muxes,
but I think the example illustrates the point. Is that assessment
correct?

Would this block the addition of the "*-switch" properties? IIUC the
two are related but not dependent on each other.

The *-switch properties are phandles which the Type C connector class
framework expects (and uses to get handles to those switches).
These would point to the "mux" or "group of mux" abstractions as noted earlier.

I'd suggest we work on updating the Type C connector class to a model
that can describe connections for both DT (using OF graph) and ACPI,
if something
like that exists, but let it not block the addition of these switches
to usb-connector.yaml; they will be needed by the Type C connector
class framework
regardless of the form the connection description takes.

Best regards,
