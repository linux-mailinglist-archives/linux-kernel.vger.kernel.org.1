Vinod, there is no acceptance progress on this. The patch is really straight
and for the Intel controller. They know what they're doing. I would apply
this. The code can be refined at anytime. It's a fix. I tested it and I can
confirm, that it fixes the issue. It's a vital patch for 5.10 to enable
finally SoundWire drivers for the Intel hardware.
