The EFI handover protocol strikes again :-(

It seems we did not include any guidance in the documentation in
Documentation/x86/boot.rst regarding zero-initializing BSS, and come
to think of it, we don't include any other requirements either, i.e.,
regarding placement wrt section alignment etc. This is a serious bug.
Even though EFI usually lays out PE/COFF images in files the exact way
they appear in memory, this is not actually required by the spec. Most
notably, the virtual size can be smaller than the file size, and the
loader is expected to zero-initialize the difference as well.

Since the EFI handover protocol should be considered deprecated at
this point (and is never going to be supported in upstream GRUB
either, for instance), I would recommend the systemd-boot developers
to start looking into deprecating this as well, and switch to the
ordinary PE/COFF entry point, and use the new initrd callback protocol
for initrd loading.

On the Linux/x86 side, we should at least add some code to the EFI
handover protocol entry point to zero initialize BSS, and ensure that
it is either not needed in other places, or add the code to deal with
those as well.

Thanks Arvind.
