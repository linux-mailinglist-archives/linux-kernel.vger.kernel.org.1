Thanks Mark, Alex for the status updates on perf NMI feature.

Alex,

As the hard-lockup detection patch [1] has a dependency on perf NMI
patch-set, I will rebase and test hard-lockup detector when you have
got a working tree. But due to the dependency, I think patch [1]
should be accepted along with perf NMI patch-set. So would you be open
to include this patch as part of your series?
