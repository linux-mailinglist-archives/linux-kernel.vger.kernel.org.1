Hi Sam,

Many thanks for your feedback. See my answers below.

My undestanding, I might be wrong, is that userspace should don't know which
bits, regulators, etc, are needed to get the EDID with an ioctl. Is the kernel
that should make sure that all is set properly (the required regulators, etc)
when userspace wants to read the EDID.

It is, but I don't have enough hardware details to be able to answer why we need
to do this. What is well tested is that, if I don't power the panel before
powering on the bridge, it doesn't get a proper EDID. Seems that when the bridge
goes up, the firmware tries to read the EDID and caches somehow. Well not sure.
