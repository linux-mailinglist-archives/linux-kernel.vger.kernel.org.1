As we have discussed in other email thread, returning 0 should be really
possible only for an nr_pages == 0. And even in that case we should
rather return EINVAL. I wanted to do that change as well but gup is a
heavily used interface and I do not have time to check all existing
callers.

I wouldn't really overcomplicate it. If you are worried about future
bugs then we can warn into the log when !err && nr_pages somewher inside
gup code. But let's keep callers as simple as possible. We surely do not
want to check for !err in all users now.

The code clarity is the primary reason.
