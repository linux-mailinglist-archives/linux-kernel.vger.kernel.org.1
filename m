Yes. But correction may take lot of time, e.g. also more then one day.

So during this period when correction is in progress, measuring time
difference via CLOCK_MONITONIC will have incorrect results.

It already happened for me, system clock was shifted by one hour and
chronyd started adjustment, it slow down system clock. 6 real hours
passed and via system clock was measured time difference only about
5 hours and 20 minutes (correction was still in progress as system
clock at that time was still shifted by about 20 minutes).

So measuring time differences via clock affected by NTP adjustment
resulted in error which was more then 30 minutes.

CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW is not affected by this correction progress, so it
should gives better results. Or not?

Ok, so it looks like that CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW is not the best choice.

Problem is simple: Measure time difference between two events and not to
be affected by the fact that system clock on machine is incorrect or
that time daemon is actually adjusting time.

I need to know if difference between those two events in more then some
period or not.

So if I want to know if time difference is more then 5 hours and 40
minutes then measurement via clock which is affected by NTP adjustment
would give me wrong result. As described above in reality 6 hours
passed but clock measured only 5 hours and 20 minutes.
