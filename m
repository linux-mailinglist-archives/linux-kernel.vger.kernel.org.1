Historical :). AFAIK pagevec abstraction was first created to make swapping
out and reclaim of pages more effective. It has grown a bit since then...

Well, yes, I'd keep the argument order to match original
pagevec_lookup_entries().

Agreed.

Right but those are really pretty internal helper functions so I don't
think they form or strong precedence.

I agree that having non-trivial xarray code in mm/swap.c isn't attractive
either. Dunno, I dislike the inconsistency between find_get_pages() and
find_get_entries() you create but they aren't completely consistent anyway
so I can live with that. Or we can just leave the pagevec_lookup_entries()
wrapper and the API will stay consistent...
