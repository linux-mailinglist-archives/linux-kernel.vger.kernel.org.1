I gave that a spin on Juno r0 and HiKey960 (both GICv2), all good! I also
wanted to try it out on my eMAG (to get some GICv3 airtime) but ran into
"technical difficulties". I think I'll need to get someone to go poke
it (most likely next week). I'm pretty sure I'm the one who should be
asking you for hardware, but if there's anything specific you need me to
test, please shout.

I have a few extra nits/comments in some patches, but it's all fairly minor
so FWIW you can also add, for patches [01-10, 14-15]:

I haven't really looked at those other irqchips, but I can give it a shot
if no one else shows up. Also I'll most likely look at the arm side, but
I'm afraid I'm too well-done right now to pay much more attention to
details.
