Correct explanation. Thanks, Vlastimil.

This patchset is a preparation for my future patchset "mm/cma: manage the m=
emory
of the CMA area by using the ZONE_MOVABLE" [1] to solve the many CMA proble=
ms.

CMA areas can be on the all the memory range, from ZONE_DMA to ZONE_HIGHMEM=
.
And, in my future patchset [1], all the CMA areas are managed through
the ZONE_MOVABLE
and the range of the ZONE_MOVABLE is extended to cover all the CMA
areas. In this
case, following scenario would be possible.

CMA area 1: 32MB size on the memory range 16MB~48MB (originally on the
ZONE_NORMAL)
CMA area 2: 32MB size on the memory range 896MB~928MB (originally on
the ZONE_HIGHMEM)

With my future patchset [1], ZONE_MOVABLE manages all the pages from
CMA area 1 and 2.
So, ZONE_MOVABLE has both direct mapped page and un-mapped page. Since one =
zone
has two types of pages, current PageHighMem() implemented by using
zone index could not
work correctly. So, I make this patchset to change the PagHighMem()
implementation.

The range of CMA area is highly depends on system architecture and
device. Each device
using CMA area would have different limitation for address range and
someone's limitation
could be low memory range.

Thanks.
