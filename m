Hello!

I have not got any answer to my email from Marcel for months, so I'm
adding other developers to loop. Could somebody tell me that is the
replacement API if above one is going to be removed?

I was not able to find any documentation where could be described this
API nor information about deprecation / removal.

And are you aware of the fact that removing of API could potentially
break existing applications?

I really need to know which API should I use, because when I use API
which is going to be removed, then my application stops working. And I
really want to avoid it.

Also I have not got any response yet, how can I read list of supported
codecs by bluetooth adapter by ordinary non-root user? Audio application
needs to know list of supported codecs and it is really insane to run it
as root.
