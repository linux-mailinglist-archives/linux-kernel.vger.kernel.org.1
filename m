Hi Bao, Deepa, sorry for this very late response. The test machine was
not available for sometime, and I restarted to work on this problem.

For the workaround mention by Deepa (by remote the is_kdump_kernel()
check), it didn't work, the machine still hangs upon shutdown.
The devices that were left in an unknown state and sending interrupt
could be a problem, but it's irrelevant to this hanging problem.

I think I didn't make one thing clear, The PCI UR error never arrives
in kernel, it's the iLo BMC on that HPE machine caught the error, and
send kernel an NMI. kernel is panicked by NMI, I'm still trying to
figure out why the NMI hanged kernel, even with panic=-1,
panic_on_io_nmi, panic_on_unknown_nmi all set. But if we can avoid the
NMI by shutdown the devices in right order, that's also a solution.
