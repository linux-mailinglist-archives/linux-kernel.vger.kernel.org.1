Hi David,

I've botched the threading, so there are discussions with respect to the 
previous patch-set that is missing on this thread, which I will 
summarize below:

V1:
[1] https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/8/5/1097
[2] https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/8/6/1040
[3] https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/8/11/893
[4] https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/8/21/1490
[5] https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/9/11/1072

[1] features version of the patch featured a finite number of retries, 
which has been stable for our kernels. In [2], Andrew questioned whether 
we could actually find a way of solving the problem on the grounds that 
doing a finite number of retries doesn't actually fix the problem (more 
importantly, in [4] Andrew indicated that he would prefer not to merge 
the patch as it doesn't solve the issue).  In [3], I suggest one actual 
fix for this, which is to use preempt_disable/enable() to prevent 
context switches from occurring during the periods in copy_one_pte() and 
exit_mmap() (I forgot to mention this case in the commit text) in which 
_refcount > _mapcount for a page - you would also need to prevent 
interrupts from occurring to if we were to fully prevent the issue from 
occurring.  I think this would be acceptable for the copy_one_pte() 
case, since there _refcount > _mapcount for little time.  For the 
exit_mmap() case, however, _refcount is greater than _mapcount whilst 
the page-tables are being torn down for a process - that could be too 
long for disabling preemption / interrupts.

So, in [4], Andrew asks about two alternatives to see if they're viable: 
(1) acquiring locks on the exit_mmap path and migration paths, (2) 
retrying indefinitely.  In [5], I discuss how using locks could increase 
the time it takes to perform a CMA allocation, such that a retry 
approach would avoid increased CMA allocation times. I'm also uncertain 
about how the locking scheme could be implemented effectively without 
introducing a new per-page lock that will be used specifically to solve 
this issue, and I'm not sure this would be accepted.

We're fine with doing indefinite retries, on the grounds that if there 
is some long-term pinning that occurs when alloc_contig_range returns 
-EBUSY, that it should be debugged and fixed.  Would it be possible to 
make this infinite-retrying something that could be enabled or disabled 
by a defconfig option?

Thanks,

Chris.
