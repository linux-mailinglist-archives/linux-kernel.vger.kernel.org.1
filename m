I thought the GENI hardware was supposed to be able to queue commands up
and then plow through them to interrupt the CPU when it finished. If
that was supported would there be any problems? I assume we could remove
the wait for CS disable and interrupt on step 5 and also the wait for
CS/interrupt on step 2 because it is bundled with the transfer in step
3.

Where is the delay? On step 2 where we wait to transfer or at step 5
when we wait for CS to be dropped, or both?

One thing to note is that the GPIO driver doesn't tell us that it has
actually asserted/deasserted the GPIO. It writes to the controller and
moves on so we don't know when it has actually gone into effect.
Hopefully moving to GPIO mode doesn't mean we get weird problems where
CS isn't asserted yet and a transfer starts wiggling the lines.

I see nothing wrong with specifying the CS gpios in DT. Seems like that
should always be there and then the driver should decide to use GPIO
mode or not. So

Perhaps we should have qup-spiN-default and qup-spiN-cs-gpio though?
That way the driver can properly mux the pin to be gpio mode if it wants
to. I don't see a way to mux the pin to be "qup" until the driver
decides it doesn't want that.
