Yes this is the main reason for the requirement of this fix.

You are right, this case is very unlikely that nobody lists regions with zero
gap, in such a case they will combine both the regions. Reason for highlighting
this point is, the same fix will handle this case also. Here I used memory
regions to refer entries of dma-ranges(allowed IOVA addresses range) not
reserved IOVA ranges. start and end variables in this function refers to
start and end addresses of reserved IOVA ranges which are derived from
dma ranges resources start and end values.

Yes I agree with you this one line is sufficient.

I think "end < start" is better choice because it tells list is not sorted
and "!=" contradicts previous condition "end > start".

I agree with you, these lines were added to explain the issue and fix with
more details.
I will send a new patch with a single line change as you said.
" } else if (end < start) {"
