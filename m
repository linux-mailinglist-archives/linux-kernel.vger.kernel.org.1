Sorry I forgot to update but I did try on Friday and I could not manage
to trigger it on D06/Kunpeng920 either. I used 5.8.0-rc4.

I am not sure how you can do that since HNS3 is integrated NIC so
physical hot-plug is definitely ruled out. local_pci_probe()
should also get called when we insert the hns3_enet module which
eventually initializes the driver.

Sure. I understand that part. But if this is a ABBA type deadlock
then beside the irq_desc lock the rq->lock should belong to the
same runqueue which effectively means the 2 context of the hns and
the VM are referring to same cpu?

Sure. That also means if the lock ordering has to be imposed then
perhaps it has to be taken care from the other context of hns3.

One way is to avoid calling irq_set_affinity_hint() during initialization
but this does not guarantees that this conflict will not happen in future
while using irq_set_affinity_hint() as it is well possible that VM is again
about to be scheduled out at that time.

Also, I think this problem should appear even if we use Intel NIC and
perform the same set of steps.
