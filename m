I appreciate your caution, and if you let me know what exactly your
concerns are, we could probably work them out together.

Mind elaborating the side effects?

I like this specific example from patch 3. Here is what it does: we
have three places using the same boilerplate, i.e., page_off_lru() +
__ClearPageLRU(), the patch moves __ClearPageLRU() into page_off_lru(),
which already does __ClearPageActive() and __ClearPageUnevictable().
Later on, we rename page_off_lru() to __clear_page_lru_flags() (patch
8).

Its point seems quite clear to me. Why would *anybody* want to use
two helper functions *repeatedly* when the job can be done with just
one? Nobody is paid by the number of lines they add, right? :) And
for that matter, why would anybody want any boilerplate to be open
coded from the same group of helper functions arranged in various
ways? I don't think the answer is subjective, but I don't expect
everybody to agree with me.

Now back to your general question: what's the point of this series?
Readability -- less error prone and easier to maintain. This series
consolidate open-coded boilerplate like the following in many places.
Take lru_lazyfree_fn() as an example:

-		bool active = PageActive(page);
 		int nr_pages = thp_nr_pages(page);
 
-		del_page_from_lru_list(page, lruvec,
-				       LRU_INACTIVE_ANON + active);
+		del_page_from_lru_list(page, lruvec);
 		ClearPageActive(page);
 		ClearPageReferenced(page);
		<snipped>
 		ClearPageSwapBacked(page);
-		add_page_to_lru_list(page, lruvec, LRU_INACTIVE_FILE);
+		add_page_to_lru_list(page, lruvec);

I hope this helps, but if it doesn't, I'd be more than happy to have
more discussions on the details. And not that I don't appreciate your
review, but please be more specific than 'sounds like a risk' or 'have
even more side effects' so I can address your concerns effectively.
