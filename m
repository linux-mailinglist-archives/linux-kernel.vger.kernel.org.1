It's probably too late to water this down, but it's unfortunate to have
this comment in the upstream commit history.

It's not constructive to call the native compiler configuration of
major distros for many years a "custom" toolchain.  Unmodified GCC has
had a clean configure option for this for a very long time; it's not
someone's dirty hack.  (The wisdom of armhf's choice of -mthumb might
be debated, but it is well established.)

Ignoring the triplet and passing random options to a compiler in the
hopes that it will do the right thing for an irregular usecase has never
been reliable.  Usecases don't get much more irregular than building
vdso32.

arch/arm has the proper options in its Makefiles.

This patch is a kernel bugfix, plain and simple.

Does this need to go to stable?
