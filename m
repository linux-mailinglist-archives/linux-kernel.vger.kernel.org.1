Note that smp_wmb() doesn't imply flushing the store-buffers. Nor does
the TSO memory model of x86 (it's the main feature that distinguishes
TSO from SC).

x86's MFENCE is a completion barrier and does imply so though.

It got mentioned earlier in the contect of a stream of changes, an
uninterrupted modifier can basically starve a search.

But I don't think that's a problem with the current users.

Well, the key space is determined by the comparator operators that are
provided, which can easily compare values that are larger than 64bit.

But yes, the address space implies limits regardless of the actual
key-space. Note that BITS_PER_LONG does not related to the actual memory
space for things like i386-PAE and ARMv7-LPEA.
