Hi Guido.

The following is from my notes:

bridge/adv7511                         done
bridge/simple-bridge                   done
bridge/synopsys/dw-hdmi                done
bridge/display-connector.c             done
bridge/lvds-codec                      done
bridge/cdns-dsi                        done
bridge/panel.c                         done
bridge/parade-ps8640                   done
bridge/sil-sii8620                     done
bridge/synopsys/dw-mipi-dsi            done
bridge/tc358768                        done
bridge/thc63lvd1024                    done
bridge/ti-tfp410                       done

This is a list of bridge drivers which are converted and in
drm-misc-next now.
I have a patch set that converts some more but they needs a bit more
polishing before they are done.

Laurent has written about is in a very comprehensive way several times.
The short variant is that we needed to support chained bridges where
the individual bridges implemented the functions required by the
connector - and creating the connector was pushed back to the display
driver.
So the bridges now announce their support of for example hot-plug detect
and reading edid. Then the connector, created by the display driver, can
use the operations exported by the bridge drivers.
