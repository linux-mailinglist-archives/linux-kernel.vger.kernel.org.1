Subject: [PATCH v6 04/17] sched/topology: Define and assign sched_domain flag metadata

There are some expectations regarding how sched domain flags should be laid
out, but none of them are checked or asserted in
sched_domain_debug_one(). After staring at said flags for a while, I've
come to realize there's two repeating patterns:

- Shared with children: those flags are set from the base CPU domain
  upwards. Any domain that has it set will have it set in its children. It
  hints at "some property holds true / some behaviour is enabled until this
  level".

- Shared with parents: those flags are set from the topmost domain
  downwards. Any domain that has it set will have it set in its parents. It
  hints at "some property isn't visible / some behaviour is disabled until
  this level".

There are two outliers that (currently) do not map to either of these:

o SD_PREFER_SIBLING, which is cleared below levels with
  SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY. The change was introduced by commit

    9c63e84db29b ("sched/core: Disable SD_PREFER_SIBLING on asymmetric CPU capacity domains")

  as it could break misfit migration on some systems. In light of this, we
  might want to change it back to make it fit one of the two categories and
  fix the issue another way.

o SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY, which gets set on a single level and isn't
  propagated up nor down. From a topology description point of view, it
  really wants to be SDF_SHARED_PARENT; this will be rectified in a later
  patch.

Tweak the sched_domain flag declaration to assign each flag an expected
layout, and include the rationale for each flag "meta type" assignment as a
comment. Consolidate the flag metadata into an array; the index of a flag's
metadata can easily be found with log2(flag), IOW __ffs(flag).
