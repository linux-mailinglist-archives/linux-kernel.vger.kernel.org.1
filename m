OK, I see your point, this paragraph can be removed, however, I think
it makes it clear to understand the rationale for this change. As I
understand, the per console loglevel has been proposed but were never
accepted.

printk.always_kmsg_dump is not working for me because ramoops has its
own filtering based on dump_oops boolean, and ignores everything but
panics and conditionally oops.
max_reason makes the ramoops internal logic cleaner compared to using dump_oops.

I agree, the reasons in kmsg_dump_reason do not order well  (I
actually want to add another reason for kexec type reboots, and where
do I put it?), so how about if we change the ordering list to
bitfield/flags, and instead of max_reason provide: "reasons" bitset?

Thank you,
Pasha
