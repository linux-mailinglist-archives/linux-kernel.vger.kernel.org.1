Hi Marcel,

Thanks for merging.

I agree that the distinction between SCO/eSCO and ACL/LE is a bit
concerning for scheduling. I will make some time to revisit this as
part of Audio improvements we are making.

Thanks
Abhishek

n this code was originally written, we only had ACL and SCO packets. The wo=
rld was pretty simple. And right now we also only have two packets types (i=
gnoring ISO packets for now), but we added LE and eSCO as separate scheduli=
ng and thus =E2=80=9Cfake=E2=80=9D packet types.

o trouble since we prioritize BR/EDR packets over LE packets and SCO over e=
SCO. I think we should have looked at all packets based on SO_PRIORITY and =
with ISO packets we have to most likely re-design this. Anyway, just someth=
ing to think about.
