The scaling to 100 doesn't seem to match how the thermal framework is
using them.  Take a look at of_cpufreq_cooling_register().  It takes
the "dynamic-power-coefficient" and passes it as "capacitance" into
__cpufreq_cooling_register().  That's eventually used to compute
power, which is documented in the code to be in mW.

power = (u64)capacitance * freq_mhz * voltage_mv * voltage_mv;
do_div(power, 1000000000);

/* power is stored in mW */
freq_table[i].power = power;

That's used together with "sustainable-power", which is the attribute
that Matthias is trying to set.  That value is documented to be in mW
as well.

...so if the silver cores are always scaled to 100 regardless of how
much power they actually draw then it'll be impossible to actually
think about "sustainable-power" as a mW value.  Presumably we either
need to accept that fact (and ideally document it) or we need to
change the values for silver / gold cores (we could still keep the
relative values the same and just scale them).
