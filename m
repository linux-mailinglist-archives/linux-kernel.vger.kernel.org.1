I'm sorry I didn't make it clear how to do this. I'm going to reset commit

which re-enable ITS  on the ATF, and drop the checks for 
ITS_FLAGS_SAVE_SUSPEND_STATE

in the OS.

In other words, the ATF does not re-enable ITS, and OS itself re-enables 
ITS when it resumes.

To do this, I have to remove the check of ITS_FLAGS_SAVE_SUSPEND_STATE 
because it is not set.


Thanks
