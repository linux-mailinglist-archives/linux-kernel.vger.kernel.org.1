The arch dependency is not going way with this change either. Just that
its getting transferred to hugetlb_add_hstate() which gets called from
arch_initcall() in every architecture.

The perfect timing here happens to be because of arch_initcall() instead.
This is probably fine, as long as

0. hugetlb_add_hstate() is always called at arch_initcall()
1. N_MEMORY mask is guaranteed to be initialized at arch_initcall()
2. CMA reservation is available to be called at arch_initcall()
