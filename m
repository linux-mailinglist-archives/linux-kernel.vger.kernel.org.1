Yes, related to this set. This is set is for native ENQCMD support.
VMCS use of IOASID notifier is for the guest SVA + ENQCMD.
We need to maintain a G-H PASID translation in VMCS PASID translation
table. When guest binds a GPASID to a host PASID, this translation
table can be updated such that subsequent ENQCMD in the guest can
resolve to a host PASID.

CH 7.3.1 of DSA spec.

Yes, VFIO can track all the PASIDs and make sure they do unbind before
free. But that might be more complicated in VFIO, whereas here, when a
guest exits, VFIO can just free the entire IOASID set, IOASID will
notify IOMMU and do all the cleanup.

For maintaining VMCS pasid translation table, KVM still need to know
bind/unbind in addition to free events.

In addition, we also have VDCM (virtual device composition module) that
needs to perform G-H PASID translation and sanity check. VDCM needs the
free event only. This is also in the DSA spec above. The use is that
when the guest programs a GPASID into a virtual device, VDCM (similar
to SRIOV PDEV driver) needs to intercept (via vfio mdev) and translate
GPASID to HPASID.
