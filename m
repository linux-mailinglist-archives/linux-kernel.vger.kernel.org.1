Ah yes, DRM's lack of hot-plug and discrete component support... Is
that not improved with some of the bridge rework?

Anyways, given there is a child dependency on the parent, I don't
think we should work-around DRM deficiencies in DT.

BTW, There's also a deferred probe timeout you can use which stops
deferring probe some number of seconds after late_initcall.
