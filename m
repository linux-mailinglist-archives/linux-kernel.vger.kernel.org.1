After reading all the threads and mulling over this, I am going to deflect from
Mel and Michal and not oppose the idea of lockless allocation. I would even
prefer to do it via the gfp flag and not a completely separate path. Not using
the exact code from v1, I think it could be done in a way that we don't actually
look at the new flag until we find that pcplist is empty - which should not
introduce overhead to the fast-fast path when pcpclist is not empty. It's more
maintainable that adding new entry points, IMHO.

But there's still the condition that it's sufficiently shown that the allocation
is useful for RCU. In that case I prefer that the page allocator (or MM in
general) can give its users what they need without having to work around it.
Seems like GFP_ATOMIC is insufficient today so if that means we need a new flag
for the raw spinlock context, so be it. But if your usage of __GFP_NO_LOCKS
depends on the result of preempt_count() or similar check whether this is a
context that needs it, I'd prefer to keep this in the caller.
