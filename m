One example why drm/msm can't use DMA API is multiple page table support 
(that is landing in 5.10), which is something that definitely couldn't 
work with DMA API.

Another one is being able to choose the address for mappings, which 
AFAIK DMA API can't do (somewhat related to this: qcom hardware often 
has ranges of allowed addresses, which the dma_mask mechanism fails to 
represent, what I see is drivers using dma_mask as a "maximum address", 
and since addresses are allocated from the top it generally works)

But let us imagine drm/msm switches to using DMA API. a2xx GPUs have 
their own very basic MMU (implemented by msm_gpummu.c), that will need 
to implement dma_map_ops, which will have to call 
arch_sync_dma_for_{cpu,device}. So drm/msm still needs to call 
arch_sync_dma_for_{cpu,device} in that scenario.
