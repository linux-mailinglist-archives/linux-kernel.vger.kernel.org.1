Subject: [PATCH v12 12/18] x86/fsgsbase/64: move save_fsgs to header file
Date:   Mon, 11 May 2020 00:53:05 -0400
Message-Id: <20200511045311.4785-13-sashal@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.20.1
In-Reply-To: <20200511045311.4785-1-sashal@kernel.org>
References: <20200511045311.4785-1-sashal@kernel.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Given copy_thread_tls() is now shared between 32 and 64 bit and we need
to use save_fsgs() there, move it to a header file.
