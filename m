Hi Juri,

thanks for sharing the v2 patchset!

In the next days I'll have a look at it, and try some tests...

In the meanwhile, I have some questions/comments after a first quick
look.

If I understand well, the patchset does not apply deadline servers to
FIFO and RR tasks, right? How does this patchset interact with RT
throttling?

If I understand well, patch 6/6 does something like "use deadline
servers for SCHED_OTHER only if FIFO/RR tasks risk to starve
SCHED_OTHER tasks"... Right? I understand this is because you do not
want to delay RT tasks if they are not starving other tasks. But then,
maybe what you want is not deadline-based scheduling. Maybe a
reservation-based scheduler based on fixed priorities is what you want?
(with SCHED_DEADLINE, you could provide exact performance guarantees to
SCHED_OTHER tasks, but I suspect patch 6/6 breaks these guarantees?)


			Thanks,
				Luca
