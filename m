I'm a bit at a loss here, about two things:

RTS is an output pin controlled by the UART. IIUC if the UART port is active
and hardware flow control is enabled the RTS signal is either driven to high
or low, but not floating.

Now lets assume I'm wrong with the above and RTS can be floating. We only want
the BT SoC to send data when the host UART is ready to receive them, right?
RTS is an active low signal, hence by configuring it as a pull-down the BT
SoC can send data regardless of whether the host UART actually asserts RTS,
so the host UART may not be ready to receive it. I would argue that if there
is really such a thing as a floating RTS signal then it should have a pull-up,
to prevent the BT SoC from sending data at any time.

I'm not an expert in UART communication and pinconf, so it could be that I
got something wrong, but as of now it seems to me that no pull is the correct
config for RTS.
