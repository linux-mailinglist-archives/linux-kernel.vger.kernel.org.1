Ah, my wording is misleading, yes.  That comment
"(using an mm variable instead of vma->vm_mm repeatedly)"
was nothing more than a note, that the patch is bigger than it could be,
because I decided to use an mm variable, instead of vma->vm_mm repeatedly.
But it looks as if I'm saying there used to be a need for READ_ONCE() or
something, and by using the mm variable I was fixing the problem.

No, sorry: delete that line now the point is made: the mm variable is
just a patch detail, it's not important.

The fix (as the subject suggested) is for retract_page_tables() to check
khugepaged_test_exit(), after acquiring mmap lock, before doing anything
to the page table.  Getting the mmap lock serializes with __mmput(),
which briefly takes and drops it in __khugepaged_exit(); then the
khugepaged_test_exit() check on mm_users makes sure we don't touch the
page table once exit_mmap() might reach it, since exit_mmap() will be
proceeding without mmap lock, not expecting anyone to be racing with it.

(I devised that protocol for ksmd, then Andrea adopted it for khugepaged:
back then it was important for these daemons to have a hold on the mm,
without an actual reference to mm_users, because that would prevent the
OOM killer from reaching exit_mmap().  Nowadays with the OOM reaper, it's
probably less crucial to avoid mm_users, but I think still worthwhile.)

Thanks a lot for looking at these patches so quickly,
Hugh
