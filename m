Hi Greg,

Here is the MHI pull request for v5.11 cycle. The reason for doing pull request
this time is because of the immutable branch which gets merged for handling
networking and MHI changes.

Details are in the signed tag, please consider merging!

Thanks,
Mani

----------------------------------------------------------------
MHI patches for v5.11

Here is the MHI patch set for v5.11. Most of the patches are cleanups and fixes
but there are some noticeable changes too:

1. Loic finally removed the auto-start option from the channel parameters of the
MHI controller. It is the duty of the client drivers like qrtr to start/stop the
channels when required, so we decided to remove this option. As a side effect,
we changed the qrtr driver to start the channels during its probe and removed
the auto-start option from ath11k controller.

**NOTE** Since these changes spawns both MHI and networking trees, the patches
are maintained in an immutable branch [1] and pulled into both mhi-next and
ath11k-next branches. The networking patches got acks from ath11k and networking
maintainers as well.

2. Loic added a generic MHI pci controller driver. This driver will be used by
the PCI based Qualcomm modems like SDX55 and exposes channels such as QMI,
IP_HW0, IPCR etc...

3. Loic fixed the MHI device hierarchy by maintaining the correct parent child
relationships. Earlier all MHI devices lived in the same level under the parent
device like PCIe. But now, the MHI devices belonging to channels will become the
children of controller MHI device.

4. Finally Loic also improved the MHI device naming by using indexed names such
as mhi0, mhi1, etc... This will break the userspace applications depending on
the old naming convention but since the only one user so far is Jeff Hugo's AI
accelerator apps, we decided to make this change now itself with his agreement.

5. Bhaumik fixed the qrtr driver by stopping the channels during remove. This
patch also got ack from networking maintainer and we decided to take it through
MHI tree (via immutable branch) since we already had a qrtr change.
