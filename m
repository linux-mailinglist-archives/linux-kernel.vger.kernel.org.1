There are two inconsistencies before any of my patches:
1) in intel-spi.c: uses the module parameter only for bay trail.
2) intel-spi.c uses a module parameter whereas intel-spi-pci doesn't

My initial patch addressed #2 by also adding a module parameter to
intel-spi-pci,
but then some of you discouraged me to use module parameters.
Mika showed up and suggested to leave intel-spi.c as is (with its
module parameter),
and remove the code in intel-spi-pci that tried to turn the SPI chip
writable if the BIOS
was unlocked.

What I'm trying to say is that, if the BIOS is unlocked
(no driver involvement here), the intel-spi-pci turns the
chip writable even without changing the module parameter of intel-spi.
This is because the attempt to turn the chip writable occurs in
the probing of intel-spi-pci, that is, earlier than the intel-spi
initialization.

Was it clear from above?

Before commenting below, it's important to note again that
the driver will succeed in turning the chip writable only if the
BIOS is unlocked by its build time specification.
The WPD field (Write Protect Disable) bit only has effect if
the BIOS is not locked. This WPD bit is the one that the intel-spi-pci
driver tries to set unconditionally. If the BIOS is locked, it will cause
no effect. But if the BIOS is not locked, the chip will
end up in Write Protect Disabled state.
My latest patch simply leaves alone the WPD bit in intel-spi-pci,
not trying to set it to 1.

I'm not sure the options below are now fully compatible
with my explanation above.
