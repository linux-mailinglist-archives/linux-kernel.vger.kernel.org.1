That means that every actor maintaining their own stable version of the 
kernel have to do their own audit when they do backports (assuming the 
audit would be done for upstream) to be able to provide a safe 
livepatching feature in their kernel.

I think most people interested in livepatching are using GCC built 
kernels, but I could be mistaken (althought in the long run, both 
compilers should be supported, and yes, I realize the objtool solution 
currently only would support GCC).

I don't know how feasible it will be to get it into GCC if people decide 
to go with that. Also, now that I think about it, it will probably come 
with similar limitations as stackframes where the unwinder would need to 
know when/where the shadow call stack is unavailable for some reason and 
the stack trace is not reliable. (it might be a bit simpler to audit 
than stack frame setting and maybe have less limitations, but I guess 
there will still be cases where we can't rely on it)
