Apologies but that is exactly what it says. From section 6.2.3,

"After the GETSEC[SENTER] rendezvous handshake is performed between all
logical processors in the platform, the ILP loads the chipset
authenticated code module (SINIT) and performs an authentication check.
If the check passes, the processor hashes the SINIT AC module and stores
the result into TPM PCR 17. It then switches execution context to the
SINIT AC module."

To get a little into the details, the ACM is signed with an RSA key that
is deeply embedded into the CPU, thus why there is an ACM per
architecture as each one gets a new key. The authentication check is
detailed in the section GETSEC[ENTERACCS], but in the end the ACM has
had a crypto signature check carried out by the CPU (not firmware) and
is also cryptographically hashed by the CPU (again not firmware). On top
of this, both operations are executed after all interrupts have been
disabled and the ACM has been loaded into ACRAM from memory that was
protected by the IOMMU. Only after all this succeeds is the ACM allowed
to execute.

To the ACM, this is just an allocated buffer for it to record a TPM
event log for all the measurements it takes. It has been a while since I
 have manually reviewed a TXT event log but I want to say there are
about five measurements taken before the ACM exits, including recording
the CRTM taken by the CPU. As such, it initialize the beginning of the
buffer with a TXT log header and records a UEFI TPM Event for each
measurement it takes. In theory, it will only ever write to this memory
but seeing that the ACM is a binary blob, I have never seen
programmatically if it ever tries reading from the memory.

>=20

>=20

Before relaunch you can have the TPM do a sign quote of the log to bind
the contents to the state of the PCRs. The why you would do that is more
about enterprise use-cases concerned with the lifecycle of enterprise
devices.When relaunch occurs, the DRTM PCRs will be reset by the CPU
before the CRTM for the relaunch is taken by the CPU and the ACM will
overwrite the existing log with new log entries. As highlighted above,
the CRTM and all measurements take by the ACM will have an extremely low
risk of external/attacker influence. When the MLE takes control,
interrupts will still be disabled and any measurements it takes prior to
enabling them will have a low risk of external/attacker influence. Once
the MLE enables the interrupts is when you have the situation whereby
the integrity you just established about the runtime can be compromised
by hostile firmware (UEFI runtime services, SMI handler, EC firmware,
PCI devices, etc.), hostile applications, and a hostile network. At this
point we could devolve into discourse over how long can load time
integrity measurements be considered trustworthy but I don't think that
is relevant to the issue at hand.

In other words, the log for the relaunch to attest what is currently
running is really no less useful than using the first launch log to
attest to the what was running in the first launch.
