arm and arm64 implement arch_scale_thermal_pressure(); the actual
implementation is in the arch_topology "driver" (GENERIC_ARCH_TOPOLOGY).

Then, the caller of arch_set_thermal_pressure() is cpufreq_cooling (see
below); that'll only get called if you have thermal zones using CPU
cooling devices.

AFAICT the current state of things imply we should have something like

        depends on (ARM || ARM64) && GENERIC_ARCH_TOPOLOGY

for that option.

The former; changing a CPU cooling device's state (IOW changing its max
allowed frequency for thermal reasons) leads to a call to
arch_set_thermal_pressure() (see
cpufreq_cooling.c::cpufreq_set_cur_state()).

It's somewhat interesting to have, at least in theory. On plain SMP that
would let the scheduler see if some CPUs are more throttled that others,
which would be leveraged when doing load balancing. It's more
interesting for big.LITTLE & co, where in the worst cases we can have
things like capacity inversion, i.e. the bigs are so thermally throttled
that they give less oomf than a LITTLE.
