Hm, good question.

Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst says:

"KVM_GET_MSR_INDEX_LIST returns the guest msrs that are supported.  The list
varies by kvm version and host processor, but does not change otherwise.

[...]

KVM_GET_MSR_FEATURE_INDEX_LIST returns the list of MSRs that can be passed
to the KVM_GET_MSRS system ioctl.  This lets userspace probe host capabilities
and processor features that are exposed via MSRs (e.g., VMX capabilities)."

Side note: MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES can be returned by both
KVM_GET_MSR_INDEX_LIST and KVM_GET_MSR_FEATURE_INDEX_LIST as we have it
both as an emulated MSR filtered by kvm_x86_ops.has_emulated_msr() and
a feature msr filtered by kvm_x86_ops.get_msr_feature(). But the later
is a whitelist so MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES won't appear on AMD and the
promise "can be passed to the KVM_GET_MSRS" is kept.

For KVM_GET_MSR_INDEX_LIST, the promise is "guest msrs that are
supported" and I'm not exactly sure what this means. Personally, I see
no point in returning MSRs which can't be read with KVM_GET_MSRS (as
this also means the guest can't read them) and KVM selftests seem to
rely on that (vcpu_save_state()) but this is not a documented feature.
