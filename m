What would be the meaning/purpose of a dailink with .dpcm_capture set, 
with only dais that support playback only?

What would be the meaning/purpose of a dailink with .capture_only set, 
but with a dai that supports playback?

What happens if none of these flags are set?

What happens when all these flags are set?

No one seems to know, so my suggestion is to align first on consistent 
configurations, then see what can be removed.

that's what my last patch did, and when there is no intersection it 
complains. Please clarify what you expect when there is no overlap 
between dai and dailink capabilities. Keep in mind that we have a mix of 
hard-codec configuration and DT-created ones, your case is not the 
general one.

Not completely true, when Morimoto-san added snd_soc_dai_stream_valid() 
it exposed tons of cases where the information on direction was not 
provided in a reliable at the DAI level. I will assert that we are still 
finding out cases with broken DAI configurations, and as a result we 
will also find broken dailink configurations. Your picture of DPCM as a 
perfectly functional system that I broke is a distortion of reality.

The reality is that we have to work in steps, first make sure all DAIs 
are properly described, then work on the dailinks and optimize at a 
later point. we will need warnings to find out what the problem cases 
are, and move slowly.
