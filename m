So the full description of the situation, which we're trying to compress into
a shorter name, is "THP pmd migration failure, due to successfully splitting
the THP". From that, the beginning part is the real point here, while the last
part is less important. In other words, the users of these events are people
who are trying to quantify THP migrations, and these events are particularly
relevant for that. The "THP migration failed" is more important here than
the reason that it failed. Or so I believe so far.

So I still think that the names are really quite good, but your point is
also important: maybe this patch should also be tracking other causes
of THP PMD migration failure, in order to get a truer accounting of the
situation.

thanks,
