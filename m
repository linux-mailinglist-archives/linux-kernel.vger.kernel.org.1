OK, so we can still get some ZONE_DMA if DRAM starts in the first GB.

I don't think it entirely solves the problem. It just happens that the
other affected SoCs don't have memory in the first GB. With this patch,
we go by the assumption that ZONE_DMA/DMA32 split is only needed if
there is memory in the low 1GB and such <32-bit devices don't have a DMA
offset.

Adding Rob H (it's easier to ask him than grep'ing the DT files ;)), we
may be ok with this assumption on current SoCs.

An alternative (and I think we had a patch at some point) is to make it
generic and parse the dma-range in the DT to identify the minimum mask
and set ZONE_DMA accordingly. But this doesn't solve ACPI, so if Linux
can boot with ACPI on RPi4 it would still be broken.
