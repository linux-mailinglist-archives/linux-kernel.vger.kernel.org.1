I don't believe this patch has that effect, mostly because it still does
cmpxchg() on words instead of bytes.

But which functions would benefit?  It seems to me this cmpxchg() is
only called from the set_pageblock_migratetype() morass of functions,
none of which are called in hot paths as far as I can make out.

So are you just reasoning by analogy with the previous patch where you
have measured a performance improvement, or did you send the wrong patch,
or did I overlook a hot path that calls one of the pageblock migration
functions?
