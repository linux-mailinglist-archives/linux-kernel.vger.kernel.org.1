This is actually what we do in our production i.e. feedback loop to
adjust the next iteration of proactive reclaim.

We eliminated the IO or slow disk issues you mentioned by only
focusing on anon memory and doing zswap.

I am assuming here by pressure level you are referring to the PSI like
interface e.g. allowing the users to tell about their jobs that X
amount of stalls in a fixed time window is tolerable.

Seems promising though I would like flexibility for giving the
resource to the per-cgroup worker.

Are you planning to work on this or should I give it a try?
