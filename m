I think I misread the cryptic hint from Robin and it is not right to 
remove
SMMU shutdown callback. For more details on why that was a bad idea and 
would
break kexec, please refer to [1].

As for the coresight, can I disable the ETR only in the tmc shutdown 
callback
or are we still concerned about the userspace coming into picture?
