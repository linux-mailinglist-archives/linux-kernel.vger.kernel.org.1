In general yes, I agree, swapoff performance is not that important.

This particular optimization has been tested a lot in the Ubuntu AWS
kernel and it seems to speed up consistently the resume of hibernated
EC2 instances (see also [1]).

So we were considering to upstream this, if we find a way to make it
more suitable for mainline inclusion.

OK, instead of adding a new ABI I can make this optimization directly in
the kernel, so that when swapoff runs it can automatically use the
fixed-size cluster readahead and continue using the default readahead
for everything else.

I'll play a bit with this and will send a new patch.

Thanks!
