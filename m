Sounds fairly serious but boy, we're late for 5.9.

I can queue it for 5.10 with a cc:stable so that it gets backported
into earlier kernels a couple of months from now, if we think the
seriousness justifies backporting(?). 

Or I can do something else - thoughts?

And...  it really is a sad little patch, isn't it?  Instead of fixing
the problem, it reduces the problem's probability by 5x.  Can't we do
better than this?
