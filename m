GFP_TRANSHUGE* is not a carved in stone design. Their primary reason to
exist is to control how hard to try for different allocation
paths/configurations because their latency expectations might be
largerly different. It is mostly the #PF path which aims to be as
lightweight as possible I believe nobody simply considered migration to be
very significant to even care. And I am still not sure it matters but
I would tend to agree that a consistency here is probably a very minor
plus.

Your changelog is slightly misleading in that regard because it suggests
that this is a real problem while it doesn't present any actual data.
It would be really nice to make the effective change really stand out.
We are only talking about __GFP_RECLAIM_KSWAPD here. So the only
difference is that the migration won't wake up kswapd now.

All that being said the changelog should be probably more explicit about
the fact that this is solely done for consistency and be honest that the
runtime effect is not really clear. This would help people reading it in
future.
