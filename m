Even if it was, we have no idea of *when* that was. Think kexec, for a
start. Or spending some variable in firmware because of $REASON.

I think this is a sensible solution if you want an epoch that starts at 
0 with
sched_clock being initialized. The other question is whether it is 
possible to
use a different timestamping source for perf that wouldn't need to be 
offset.

I wonder if we could/should make __sched_clock_offset available even 
when
CONFIG_HAVE_UNSTABLE_SCHED_CLOCK isn't defined. It feels like it would
help with this particular can or worm...
