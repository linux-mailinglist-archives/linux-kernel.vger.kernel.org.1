Again, using host_initiated or not should be a different issue?  Frankly
speaking, I don't know whether it's an issue or not, but it's different from
what this series wants to do, because it'll be the same before/after this
series. Am I right?

Or, please explain what's the "overruled objection" that you're talking about..
