Right, IIRC there was initially a proposal of a command line option 
there too, and it faced the same criticism around not being very generic 
or scalable. I believe sysfs works as a reasonable compromise since in 
many cases it can be tweaked relatively early from an initrd, and 
non-essential devices can effectively be switched at any time by 
removing and reprobing their driver.

As for a general approach for internal devices where you do believe the 
hardware is honest but don't necessarily trust whatever firmware it 
happens to be running, I'm pretty sure that's come up already, but I'll 
be sure to mention it at Rajat's imminent LPC talk if nobody else does.

Robin.
