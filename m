Yes, we should one driver for this because we are dealing with exactly 
same IP.

I found out that there is a version register at offset of 0x6000 which 
can give MAJOR, MINOR and STEP numbers.

So we could still potentially continue using "qcom,qfprom"

The address space can be split into 3 resources, which is inline with 
Specs as well

1. Raw address space ("raw")
2. Configuration address space ("conf" or "core")
3. Corrected address space ("corrected")

Exiting qfprom entries or read-only qfprom  will have "corrected" 
address space which can be the only resource provided by device tree 
entries.
Other two entries("raw" and "conf") are optional.

qfprom: qfprom@780000 {
         compatible = "qcom,qfprom";
	reg = <0 0x00780000 0 0x8ff>,
		<0 0x00782000 0 0x100>,
		<0 0x00784000 0 0x8ff>;
	reg-names = "raw", "conf", "corrected";

	vcc-supply = <&vreg_xyz>;

	clocks = <&gcc GCC_SEC_CTRL_CLK_SRC>;
	clock-names = "secclk";

	assigned-clocks = <&gcc GCC_SEC_CTRL_CLK_SRC>;
         assigned-clock-rates = <19200000>;

	qcom,fuse-blow-frequency = <4800000>

         #address-cells = <1>;
         #size-cells = <1>;

	qusb2p_hstx_trim: hstx-trim-primary@25b {
		reg = <0x25b 0x1>;
		bits = <1 3>;
	};
};

Regarding clk rate setting, the default rate can be set using 
assigned-clock-rates property, however the blow frequency can go as new 
binding.
regarding voltage range for regulator, it should come as part of board 
specific voltage regulator node. In worst case we can discuss on adding 
new bindings for allowing specific range.

for Older SoCs: we still continue to use old style with just one 
resource corresponding to corrected by default.

qfprom: qfprom@784000 {
         compatible = "qcom,qfprom";
         reg = <0 0x00784000 0 0x8ff>;
         #address-cells = <1>;
         #size-cells = <1>;

         qusb2p_hstx_trim: hstx-trim-primary@1eb {
                 reg = <0x1eb 0x1>;
                 bits = <1 4>;
         };

         qusb2s_hstx_trim: hstx-trim-secondary@1eb {
                 reg = <0x1eb 0x2>;
                 bits = <6 4>;
         };
};


I see the patch as adding write support to qfprom, rather than adding 
new driver or new SoC support.

This in summary should give us good direction for this patch!

Correct me if I miss understood something here!
