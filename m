Wow good catch. Does bit_is_set even have to be true? If it's woken due=20
to a signal, it may still be on the waitqueue right? I think your patch
works, but it looks like a pretty standard variant of "don't lose
wakeups" bug.

prepare_to_wait_event() has a pretty good pattern (and comment), I would
favour using that (test the signal when inserting on the waitqueue).

- mutex_lock_common does the signal check under its wait queue lock.

- rwsem looks like it does it backward and checks if it was woken if it
got a signal and tries to handle it that way (hopefully okay, I prefer
the standard pattern).

- futex unqueues and tests for wakeup before testing signal.

Etc. And it's not even exclusive to signals of course, those are just=20
the typical asynchronous thing that would wake us without removing from
the wait queue. Bit of a shame there is no standard pattern to follow
though.

I wonder how you could improve that. finish_wait could WARN_ON an
exclusive waiter being found on the queue?

That doesn't catch a limited count of wake ups, maybe if you passed in=20
success value to finish_wait, it could warn in case a failure has=20
WQ_FLAG_WOKEN. That doesn't help things that invent their own waitqueues
mind you. I wonder if we could do some kind of generic annotations for
anyone implementing wait queues to call, which could have debug checks
implemented?

Nick
