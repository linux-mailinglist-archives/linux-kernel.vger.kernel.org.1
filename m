It fails as described below without any changes from me.

I should've explained this better in my post, but there are two runs of
perf there.  The first is above, and is the perf that comes with the
distribution.  I'll repeat that here:
```
# perf --version
perf version 4.18.0-214.el8.ppc64le
# perf stat --metrics cpi_breakdown ./load >/dev/null             
failed: way too many variables                                                               
 Performance counter stats for './load':

     5,013,082,026      pm_run_inst_cmpl                                              (0.45%)

     6,769,854,632      pm_run_inst_cmpl                                              (1.77%)

[...and LOTS more...]
```

The second example in my previous post was from
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jolsa/perf.git
branch perf/metric
```
commit 7dd02cf0b9f04ca5339fa97f9a2280ebdd60b1db (grafted, HEAD -> perf/metric, origin/perf/metric)

    perf metric: Rename group_list to list
```

This build of `perf` fails:
```
# ~/install/bin/perf --version
perf version 5.8.rc4.g7dd02cf0b9f0
# ~/install/bin/perf stat --metrics cpi_breakdown ./load >/dev/null
