Subject: [PATCH V5 1/4] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Improve the pin config settings for CTS and TX

Remove output-high from CTS and TX as this is not really required. During
bringup to fix transfer failures this was added to match with console uart
settings. Probably some boot loader config was missing then. As it is
working fine now, remove it.

Changes in V4:
 - This is newly added in V4 to separate the improvements in pin settings
   and wakeup related changes.

Changes in V5:
 - As per Doug's comment configured pull-down for CTS pin as earlier.
