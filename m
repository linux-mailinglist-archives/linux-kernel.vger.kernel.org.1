That's fair enough, and in fact generalises to the case of zero-sized 
gaps between regions, which is indeed an oversight.

This part doesn't make much sense, however - if the regions described in 
bridge->dma_ranges overlap, that's a bug in whoever created a malformed 
list to begin with. Possibly it's just poor wording, and you're using 
"memory regions" to refer to any or all of the dma_ranges, the reserved 
IOVA ranges, and what "start" and "end" in this function represent which 
isn't quite either of those.

Surely this only needs to be a one-liner?

-		} else {
+		} else if (end < start) {

(or possibly "end != start"; I can't quite decide which expresses the 
semantic intent better)

The rest just looks like unnecessary churn - I don't think it needs 
commenting that a sorted list may simply not have gaps between entries, 
and as above I think the wording of that comment is actively misleading.
