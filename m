Hi Babu,

Thank you very much for taking a look.

Which tree did you use as baseline? These patches should apply cleanly
on top of the other resctrl patches already queued for inclusion into
v5.8 as found on the x86/cache branch of the tip repo.

It is called:
- once during initialization
- once per package initialization (when first CPU on a package comes online)
- once per read from or write to the new "thread_throttle_mode" file

If I understand correctly this would require understanding how each
architecture behaves in this regard to ensure the property within
rdt_resource is initialized correctly. While it could just be set within
get_mem_config_intel as you suggest, this property would be present in
AMD's resource and thus need a value ... could you please provide
guidance what this property should be on AMD? I looked at the bandwidth
enforcement section of
https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/56375.pdf but it is not
obvious to me where bandwidth is actually enforced and how this
enforcement is affected when threads and/or cores are running tasks with
different CLOS that have different bandwidth limits assigned.

With AMD's properties understood then the new "thread_throttle_mode"
file could be visible on all platforms, not just Intel, and display
accurate values for all and be architecture independent.

Alternatively, the new property could have values: UNDEFINED, MIN, MAX,
or PER_THREAD ... with AMD having UNDEFINED and the
"thread_throttle_mode" continues to be visible on Intel platforms only.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

> I assume that this property is probably not part of CPUID.

Correct. This specific property is model specific, but also transient in
that it is replaced by X86_FEATURE_PER_THREAD_MBA (that is part of
CPUID) in future platforms.
