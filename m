I'm fine with the data_race() placement, but I don't find the comment
very helpful. We assign the result of a READ_ONCE() to 'prev' in the
loop, so I don't think that the cpu_relax() is really relevant.

The reason we don't need READ_ONCE() here is because if we race with
the writer then either we'll go round the loop again after accidentally
thinking prev->next != node, or we'll erroneously attempt the cmpxchg()
because we thought they were equal and that will fail.

Make sense?
