Thanks for the report!

I took a rough look, and it all happens after changing the
overcommit policy from a looser one to OVERCOMMIT_NEVER. I suspect 
it is due to the same cause as the previous warning message reported
by Qian Cai https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200526181459.GD991@lca.pw/ 

Will further check it.

Thanks,
Feng
