I really don't think this is the right fix.  The problem is that these
two functions are trying to open code tpm_try_get_ops/tpm_put_ops (only
really for the tpm2 shutdown) because they want to NULL out the ops
before final mutex unlock.  The problem with the current open coding is
it doesn't shut down the clock if required (not really a problem for
shutdown, but might cause issues for simple rmmod).  I think this is
because no-one noticed the open coding when get/put was updated.

This code should all be abstracted into a single function and shared
with tpm_try_get_ops/tpm_put_ops so we can't have this happen in
future.  Possibly there should be a chip shutdown function which is
only active for TPM2 which does the correct try_get/shutdown/put
operation and then a separate simple get mutex, null ops, put mutex one
that's guaranteed to be called last.
