Thanks!

Ugh missed the loop_check_proc() part :/

The original patch wasn't that pretty, in my defense the whole thing is
pretty ugly to begin with. It'd need serious rewriting to become
palatable. If you want to yank the patch, I've got no problem with that.

The pipe patch is way cleaner, and pretty much to the point. Don't think
that's a fair comparison.

Basically it's don't wait for space (if write) if it's full, don't wait
for data if it's empty. O_NONBLOCK for the operation, instead of as a
file state. The locking isn't strictly required, and it's basically
impossible to avoid various deeper down items like memory allocations
potentially blocking, so...
