Just, no ; don't touch this, it isn't likely to get accepted ever.
file operations should all have a filp around already, we need to fix
this in our code.

(also missing quite a few Cc if you ever want to touch these bits, at
least linux-fsdevel@)



FWIW the problem has been discussed a few times previously.

I'd appreciate if you could take over from Eric and Greg's old series
that intended to fix that:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/146659832556.15781.17414806975641516683.stgit@bahia.lan/

it introduced a race somewhere, but the idea looked good at the time so
it's worth looking into.
