Well, don't do that then ;-)

So the actual permission model can be different depending on how broken
the hardware is.

How do you avoid reuse in such a huge space? That just creates yet
another problem for the kernel to keep track of who is who.

With random u64 numbers, it even becomes hard to determine if you're
sharing at all or not.

Now, with the current SMT+MDS trainwreck, any sharing is bad because it
allows leaking kernel privates. But under a less severe thread scenario,
say where only user data would be at risk, the ptrace() tests make
sense, but those become really hard with random u64 numbers too.

What would the purpose of random u64 values be for cgroups? That only
replicates the problem of determining uniqueness there. Then you can get
two cgroups unintentionally sharing because you got lucky.

Also, fundamentally, we cannot have more threads than TID space, it's a
natural identifier.
