Aye aye.

The reason I'm trying to care about this is (don't wince too hard) for that
CPU pause thing [1]. Vincent's been the one doing all the actual work so I
should let him pitch in, but TL;DR if we could "relatively quickly" migrate
all !pcpu tasks after clearing the active bit, we could stop hotplug there
and have our "CPU pause" thing.

Mmph right, we'd pretty much have to "enjoy" iterating & skipping pcpu
threads every __pick_migrate_task() call...
