It would be a fair share of the typical increase of ca. 30 KiB per
kernel release. Still, it would be lost in the noise of the increase for
v5.10-rc1:

They probably don't have any users.
AFAIK, the only users are the usual triumvirate of amiga/atari/mac
(and perhaps the fleet of VME boards in the Australian navy? ;)
