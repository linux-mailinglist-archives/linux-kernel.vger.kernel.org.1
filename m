These are provided by sabotage-linux, and are not entirely hand-hacked
but have a documented and at least partly scripted process by which
they're built:

https://github.com/sabotage-linux/kernel-headers

There's no obligation to use them, but using them makes things easier.

Note that, at the time the default was switched, there were no
upstream kernel headers compatible with a time64 userspace yet, so
whichever source you wanted to use required patching anyway.

As of 5.6 I believe everything is upstream and we could add stock 5.6
(or later) headers as a supported choice.

Uhg. Surely there should be some fix for whatever mistaken dep is
behind this? Headers shouldn't actually depend on any config/compiler
output, should they?? Or is that machinery somehow involved in
generating the syscall lists and similar?
