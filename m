Hi Rob,

Thought I'd check in again to see if you've had a chance to look at
this proposal.

Since Type C connector class framework assumes the existing
"{mode,orientation,data-role}-switch" bindings for non-DT platforms
already, as I see it, we can either:

1. Implement a different handling for DT platforms which utilizes port
end-points and update the Type C connector class framework to parse
those accordingly; this is what the above proposal suggests. It
reserves some end-points for the "switches" that the Type C connector
class framework expects and just follows the OF graph till it finds
the various switches. Other schemas that use usb-connector.yaml schema
can add more end-points as their use case deems needed, as long as
they're not the reserved ones.

<or>

2. Let various schemas that use usb-connector.schema add their own
bindings according to their requirements (in the example of
cros-ec-typec, it is adding the "*-switch" nodes directly under each
connector instead of using OF graph so that Type C connector class
framework can detect the switches, but there other examples for other
use cases).

I'm fine with either, but since this thread is now nearly 3 months
old, it would be nice to arrive at a decision.

Best regards,
