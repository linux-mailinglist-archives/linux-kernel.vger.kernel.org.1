In your paper the timing for Chrome attacks were not presented, which 
would be interesting if they are comparable to the effect of 
randomize_va_space=3 for Firefox. What's your estimate, how much slower 
it was to break Chrome ASLR vs. Firefox/randomize_va_space=2?

I think the equivalent of randomize_va_space=3 for KASLR would be that 
various kernel structures could be placed randomly with full use of all 
bits in the hardware, instead of low numbers like 9, 10 or 15 bits. 
Maybe also each module could be placed in individual random address 
instead of stuffing all modules together and likewise, instead of single 
page_offset_base, vmalloc_base and vmemmap_base, kernel would use the 
full address space to place various internal structures. I suppose this 
is not trivial.

Pointers between VMAs may also exist, for example libz.so needs to call 
open(), close(), malloc(), free() etc. from libc.so.
