That approach involves declaration of user-visible behavioral ABI which
will become impossible to change or remove if we once published.

Also, syzkaller does not want to depend on userspace being rich. There are
userspace tools (e.g. SystemTap) that can tweak kernel's behavior. If we could
use SystemTap, we could do some of tweaks using SystemTap. Likewise, use of
runtime flags which can be set from userspace involves modification of userspace
programs, which is a sort of dependency syzkaller does not want to maintain.

The advantage of build-time tweaking is that we don't need to maintain behavioral
ABI. We can change what tweak is doing over time (e.g. narrowing down what the
build-time tweaking guards, improving how to get more useful information).

I don't think per-process flags will work. Not every action is taken inside
process context who issued a syscall. Some action might be taken in interrupt
context or in kthread context. Since we have no means to propagate per-process
flags, we will need to give up more than we have to give up.

I think that such restriction should be implemented as LSM modules.
