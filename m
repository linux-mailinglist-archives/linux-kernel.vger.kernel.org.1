Subject: 5.7 regression: Lots of PCIe AER errors and suspend failure without pcie=noaer
To:     linux-kernel <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>,
        linux-pci@vger.kernel.org

Noticed a problem on my desktop with an Asus PRIME H270-PRO
motherboard after Fedora 32 upgraded to the 5.7 kernel (now on 5.7.8):
periodically there are PCIe AER errors getting spewed in dmesg that
weren't happening before, and this also seems to causes suspend to
fail - the system just wakes back up again right away, I am assuming
due to some AER errors interrupting the process. 5.6 kernels didn't
have this problem. Setting "pcie=3Dnoaer" on the kernel command line
works around the issue, but I'm not sure what would have changed to
trigger this to occur?

The errors look like this:

[    0.757005] pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER: Multiple Corrected error
received: 0000:00:1c.0
[    0.757011] pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER: PCIe Bus Error:
severity=3DCorrected, type=3DData Link Layer, (Transmitter ID)
[    0.757012] pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER:   device [8086:a292] error
status/mask=3D00001000/00002000
[    0.757013] pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER:    [12] Timeout

That device referenced is one of the Intel PCH PCIe root ports, which
seems to be connected to this PCIe to PCI bridge:

02:00.0 PCI bridge [0604]: ASMedia Technology Inc. ASM1083/1085 PCIe
to PCI Bridge [1b21:1080] (rev 04)

which in turn has nothing connected to it. I've seen reports of this
stupid ASMedia bridge device causing issues due to non-compliant
behavior in the past, this may be another case of such.

Previously reported as a Fedora bug here:
