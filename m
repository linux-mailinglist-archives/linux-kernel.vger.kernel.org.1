Good. Just enable CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT and tell please what happens.

Exactly what I am saying. And within this get_cpu_ptr() section there
was the compression/decompression sitting. So compression/decompression
happend while preemtion was off.

In that case you probably don't need 8* per-CPU memory for this task.

So you are telling me, DEFINE_PER_CPU() does not allocate the memory for
each CPU to be local but kmalloc_node() does?
