Agreed that things are broken. In general only executable mappings are
held onto by perf, so it could be I'm over worrying about //anon
stripping breaking around memory allocations. We have some other use
cases for //anon at Google but they aren't impacted by jitdump. We
have also been trying to migrate jit caches to using memfd_create,
which has the same problem that this patch fixes for //anon. Fixing
memfd_create is a separate issue to //anon. I'll try to get a repro
for Java that demonstrates the problem and then add a Tested-by.

Thanks,
Ian
