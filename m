It should be okay because vcpu->arch.dr6 is not used on AMD.

However I think a kvm_update_dr6 call is missing in
kvm_deliver_exception_payload, and kvm_vcpu_check_breakpoint should use
kvm_queue_exception_p.  I'll fix all of those.

The guest debugging test would basically cover the gdbstub case, which
is different from kvm-unit-tests.  It would run similar tests to
kvm-unit-tests, but #DB and #BP exceptions would be replaced by
KVM_EXIT_DEBUG, and MOVs to DR would be replaced by KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG.

It could also cover exception payload support in KVM_GET_VCPU_EVENTS,
but that is more complicated because it would require support for
exceptions in the selftests.
