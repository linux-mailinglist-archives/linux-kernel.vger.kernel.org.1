Yes :/ depends e.g. on how many hugepages are reserved, right?

That wouldn't hurt I guess.

I don't recall how it was implemented, but I assume yeah. There shouldn't be
complications I think, migrating out of CMA area should cause no issue for CMA,
and such migrations between zones or even nodes already happen.

We could probably merge it and watch for issues, but I'd like to have also Mel
and Joonsoo comment on it :)
