To be clear, I'm asking for tests which verify the actual ciphertext written to
disk.  So similar to _verify_ciphertext_for_encryption_policy() in xfstests, or
to vts_kernel_encryption_test in Android's VTS.

Since metadata encryption would already depend on FS_ENCRYPTION and
BLK_INLINE_ENCRYPTION, I think it would be fine to require
FS_ENCRYPTION_INLINE_CRYPT too, in order to reduce the number of combinations.
