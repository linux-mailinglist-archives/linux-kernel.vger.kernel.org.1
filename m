It has to do with doing DMA.  And we have two frameworks for doing DMA:
either the DMA API which is for general driver use, and which as part of
the design includes cache maintainance hidden behind the concept of
ownership transfers.  And we have the much more bare bones IOMMU API.

If people want to use the "raw" IOMMU API with not cache coherent
devices we'll need a cache maintainance API that goes along with it.
It could either be formally part of the IOMMU API or be separate.

arch_sync_dma_for_{cpu,device} are low-level helpers (and not very
great ones at that).  The definitively should not be used by drivers.
They would be very useful buildblocks for a IOMMU cache maintainance
API.

Of course the best outcome would be if we could find a way for the MSM
drm driver to just use DMA API and not deal with the lower level
abstractions.  Do you remember why the driver went for use of the IOMMU
API?
