yea, I was thinking about this and I think we will put a disclaimer in
here that this is not an API and the interface can change.. it's really
mostly intended to help out with running a custom metric which is not
compiled in ... I don't want to be commited to support old API

AFAICS it's used only with #SMT_on in the condition, aybe we could limit
the condition only for #SMT_on term?

is this even used anywhere? perhaps it was added just to be complete

nice idea, but let's finish straighten up what we have first ;-)

I'll try to go through all the fixes/tests you posted and let's
get it in first
