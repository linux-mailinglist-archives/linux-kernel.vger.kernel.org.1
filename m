Okay, that makes sense.

Okay, that makes sense. However in reality you don't need to split
that piece out. All you really are doing is splitting up the
first_init_pfn value over multiple threads so you just need to make
use of deferred_init_mem_pfn_range_in_zone() to initialize it.

So when you are putting together your data you are storing a starting
value and a length. All you end up having to do is make certain that
the size + start pfn is section aligned. Then if you jump to a new
section you have the option of either adding to the size of your
current section or submitting the range and starting with a new start
pfn in a new section. All you are really doing is breaking up the
first_deferred_pfn over multiple sections. What I would do is section
align end_pfn, and then check the next range from the zone. If the
start_pfn of the next range is less than end_pfn you merge the two
ranges by just increasing the size, otherwise you could start a new
range.

The idea is that you just want to define what the valid range of PFNs
are, and if there are sizable holes you skip over them. You would
leave most of the lifting for identifying exactly what PFNs to
initialize to the pfn_range_in_zone iterators since they would all be
read-only accesses anyway.

Thanks.
