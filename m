Please see my other reply. Adding \0 is not really sufficient. If we
want to have a robust code to handle the small buffer then we need to
make sure that all counters will make it to the userspace. Short output
is simply a broken result. Implementing this properly is certainly
possible, the question is whether this is worth addressing. It is not
like we are adding a lot of output into this file and it is quite likely
that the code is good as it is.
