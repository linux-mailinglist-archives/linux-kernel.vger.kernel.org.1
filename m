the summary isn't incorrect. 
The the points for me are:
1, Generally, the lru bit indicated if the page on lru list, just in some temporary
moment(isolating), the page may have no bit set when it's on lru list.  that imply
the page must be on lru list when the lru bit is set.
2, have to remove lru bit before delete it from lru list.

Good suggestion, I consider this.

Thanks
