Hi Sebastian,

I was not reading the splat correctly and thought it was from the NAPI 
path but it looks like it's from the netlink part. I think this could be 
fixed with the following patch, so both paths, NAPI, and netlink become 
non-preemptive:

--- a/net/openvswitch/flow_table.c
+++ b/net/openvswitch/flow_table.c
@@ -850,9 +850,14 @@ struct sw_flow *ovs_flow_tbl_lookup(struct 
flow_table *tbl,
         struct mask_array *ma = rcu_dereference_ovsl(tbl->mask_array);
         u32 __always_unused n_mask_hit;
         u32 __always_unused n_cache_hit;
+       struct sw_flow *flow;
         u32 index = 0;

-       return flow_lookup(tbl, ti, ma, key, &n_mask_hit, &n_cache_hit, 
&index);
+       preempt_disable();
+       flow = flow_lookup(tbl, ti, ma, key, &n_mask_hit, &n_cache_hit, 
&index);
+       preempt_enable();
+
+       return flow;
  }

  struct sw_flow *ovs_flow_tbl_lookup_exact(struct flow_table *tbl,

Note that choosing to do this in ovs_flow_tbl_lookup() and not 
flow_lookup() allows the fast-path, through NAPI, not having to call 
preempt_disable().

Any comments? If not I can sent a proper patch trough netdev.
