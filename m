I am under the impression that this patch is causing the issue.

I am tempted to revert it (and force push the branch hid/for-5.9/core)
given that the 0-day bot also complained.

We are carefully not force pushing the hid/for-next branch, and all
the merges you are seeing there are the various merges we do after
including a patch that will be sent to linus later. Our for-next
branch never gets merged into for-linus, we handle that separately.

I always thought you prefer not having forced push on the for-next
branch. But if you rather us overwriting the tip of the branch at
every commit, we can do it for sure.

For reference, the way we handle branches are:
- master branch follows Linus' when there is an upstream merge of the
hid/for-linus branch
- every single commit goes into a branch named
for-<kernel_version>/<feature_name>
- those branches are created on top of current master and are never rebased
- every time we add a patch (series) on top of a feature branch, we
merge that into hid/for-next
- when we need to send a pull request to Linus, we merge the matching
"for-<kernel_version>/*" branches into hid/for-linus

This allows to keep a clear view of what is scheduled to be sent. But
the counterpart is that the hid/for-next branch never gets merged back
into hid/for-linus.

Cheers,
Benjamin
