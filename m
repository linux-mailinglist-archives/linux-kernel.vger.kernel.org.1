I might be missing something but how can this work longterm? Or put in
another words why would this work any better than existing fragmentation
avoidance techniques that page allocator implements already - movability
grouping etc. Please note that I am not deeply familiar with those but
my high level understanding is that we already try hard to not mix
movable and unmovable objects in same page blocks as much as we can.

My suspicion is that a separate zone would work in a similar fashion. As
long as there is a lot of free memory then zone will be effectively
MOVABLE. Similar applies to normal zone when unmovable allocations are
in minority. As long as the Normal zone gets full of unmovable objects
they start overflowing to ZONE_PREFER_MOVABLE and it will resemble page
block stealing when unmovable objects start spreading over movable page
blocks.

Again, my level of expertise to page allocator is quite low so all the
above might be simply wrong...
