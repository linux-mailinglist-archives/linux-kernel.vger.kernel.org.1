Sadly I don't think you are - you're reasoning seems correct. It looks 
like the computation of effective permissions will need to be done in 
ptdump.c rather than dump_pagetables.c - as it's only ptdump.c that 
deals with the non-leaf entries as you point out.

Ah, interesting. I'm not sure what type is actually guaranteed to be 
correct. pgprotval_t is x86 specific, but it might be necessary to 
extend it to other architectures. I think I got the "unsigned long" from 
the generic page.h (and because it happens to work on most 
architectures) - but hadn't noticed that that file was specifically only 
for NOMMU architectures.

I'll see if I can come up with fixes, but if you've got anything ready 
already then please jump in.

Steve
