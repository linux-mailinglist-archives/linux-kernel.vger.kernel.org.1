The mode-switch here would actually represent the "consumer" part in
the mux-control bindings. So the mux-controls would describe the
relationship between the "mode-switch" and the mux controller(s),
while the mode-switch property describes the relationship between
something like USB Type-C Port Manager (or this cros_ec function) and
the "mux consumer".
