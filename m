I really like that idea. This will be easier to deal with than
a "just the right size" CMA area, and seems like it would be
pretty forgiving in both directions.

Keeping unmovable allocations
contained to one part of memory
should also make compaction within the ZONE_PREFER_MOVABLE area
a lot easier than compaction for higher order allocations is
today.

I suspect your proposal solves a lot of issues at once.

For (c) from your proposal, we could even claim a whole
2MB or even 1GB area at once for unmovable allocations,
keeping those contained in a limited amount of physical
memory again, to make life easier on compaction.
