I must admit that this is a bit frustrating. The new TP adds
functionality beyond operating as an Append alternative that I would
very much like to see upstream (do want to discuss details here).

I understand the concerns about deviating from the Append model, but I
believe we should find a way to add these new features. We are hiding
all the logic in the NVMe driver and not touching the interface with the
block layer, so the overall model is really not changed.

I am not arguing as a proxy, I am stating the trouble we see from our
perspective in having to diverge from mainline when our approach is
being upstream first.

Whether the I/O mode is inferior or superior, they can answer that
themselves if they read this list.

I would ask you to reconsider this position. I have a hard time
understanding how zone append emulation is a good idea in SCSI and not
in NVMe, when there is no performance penalty.
