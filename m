You are correct.
/proc/dynamic_debug/control does exist, so that debugfs isnt required,
but not verbose.  I conflated them while typing.

so, if debugfs isnt present, neither is dynamic_debug/verbose,
and run-time verbosity changes arent possible
but dynamic_debug.verbose=1 still works as boot arg
(I believe, I havent built an non-debugfs kernel myself)

verbose=2  prints quite a bit more,
during boot,  290 lines vs 16.
After you see it a dozen times, you dont need it anymore.
but I think its still worth keeping
It also is more chatty about callsites changed by ` echo $querycmd > control `

`cat control` shows complete callsite & flagstate,
it cant also show how commands are processed & changes are applied.
