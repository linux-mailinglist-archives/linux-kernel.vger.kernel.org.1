I think a different behaviour, i mean RT/non-rt, is not a way forward, because the
things will be over complicated. Please note, the proposed variant is common. It
provides a fast access to pcp-cache, what can be done lock-less. If we could extend
the "fast path" even do the lock-less prefetch(make fast path fully lock-less) from
the body would be fantastic, but that is a bit out of the question.

For example implement removing/inserting pages from "zone->free_area" as lock-less:
llist_add()/llist_del(). But that is theory and on the high level. During investigation
the things might become complicated.
