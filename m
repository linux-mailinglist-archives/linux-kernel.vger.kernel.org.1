Thanks for testing!

I take it you are doing the tests in a KVM guest?

If so I have a gut feeling that the use of local_irq_save() and
local_irq_restore() in kvm_wait() might be fishy. I might be completely
wrong here, though.

BTW, I think Xen's variant of pv spinlocks is fine (no playing with IRQ
on/off).

Hyper-V seems to do the same as KVM, and kicking another vcpu could be
problematic as well, as it is just using IPI.
