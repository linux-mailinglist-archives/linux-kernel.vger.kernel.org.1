Subject: [for-next][PATCH 18/18] ring-buffer: Do not trigger a WARN if clock going backwards is
 detected

After tweaking the ring buffer to be a bit faster, a warning is triggering
on one of my machines, and causing my tests to fail. This warning is caused
when the delta (current time stamp minus previous time stamp), is larger
than the max time held by the ring buffer (59 bits).

If the clock were to go backwards slightly, this would then easily trigger
this warning. The machine that it triggered on, the clock did go backwards
by around 450 nanoseconds, and this happened after a recalibration of the
TSC clock. Now that the ring buffer is faster, it detects this, and the
delta that is used larger than the max, the warning is triggered and my test
fails.

To handle the clock going backwards, look at the saved before and after time
stamps. If they are the same, it means that the current event did not
interrupt another event, and that those timestamp are of a previous event
that was recorded. If the max delta is triggered, look at those time stamps,
make sure they are the same, then use them to compare with the current
timestamp. If the current timestamp is less than the before/after time
stamps, then that means the clock being used went backward.

Print out a message that this has happened, but do not warn about it (and
only print the message once).

Still do the warning if the delta is indeed larger than what can be used.

Also remove the unneeded KERN_WARNING from the WARN_ONCE() print.
