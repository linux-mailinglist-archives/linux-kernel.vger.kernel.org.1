Easy for me to provide "start fast and inefficient mode" and "stop fast
and inefficient mode" APIs for MM to call!

How about rcu_mempressure_start() and rcu_mempressure_end()?  I would
expect them not to nest (as in if you need them to nest, please let
me know).  I would not expect these to be invoked all that often (as in
if you do need them to be fast and scalable, please let me know).

RCU would then be in fast/inefficient mode if either MM told it to be
or if RCU had detected callback overload on at least one CPU.

Seem reasonable?
