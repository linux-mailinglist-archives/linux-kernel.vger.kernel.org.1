How does the guest know if host has any pending events or not?

The problem we're trying to address with ACK msr is the following:
imagine host has two 'page ready' notifications back to back. It puts
token for the first on in the slot and raises an IRQ but how do we know
when the slot becomes free so we can inject the second one? Currently,
we have kvm_check_async_pf_completion() check in vcpu_run() loop but
this doesn't guarantee timely delivery of the event, we just hope that
there's going to be a vmexit 'some time soon' and we'll piggy back onto
that. Normally this works but in some special cases it may take really
long before a vmexit happens. Also, we're penalizing each vmexit with an
unneeded check. ACK msr is intended to solve these issues.
