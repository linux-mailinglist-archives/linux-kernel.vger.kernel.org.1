There were several over a number of months.  I especially recall issues
with the direct-from-idle execution of smp_call_function*() handlers,
and also with some of the special cases in the entry code, for example,
reentering the kernel from the kernel.  This latter could cause RCU to
not be watching when it should have been or vice versa.

I would of course be most aware of the issues that impinged on RCU
and that were located by rcutorture.  This is actually not hard to run,
especially if the ARM bits in the scripting have managed to avoid bitrot.
The "modprobe rcutorture" approach has fewer dependencies.  Either way:
