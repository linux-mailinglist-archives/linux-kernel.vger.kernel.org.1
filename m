Well, what we _really_ want (and what that comment is about) would be
got that list_del_init_careful() to use a "smp_store_release()" for
the last store, and then "list_empty_careful()" would use a
"smp_load_acquire()" for the corresponding first load.

On x86, that's free. On most other architectures, it's the minimal
ordering requirement.

And no, I don't think "smp_wmb()" is technically enough.

With crazy memory ordering, one of the earlier *reads* (eg loading
"wait->private" when waking things up) could have been delayed until
after the stores that initialize the list - and thus read stack
contents from another process after it's been released and re-used.

Does that happen in reality? No. There are various conditionals in
there which means that the stores end up being gated on the loads and
cannot actually be re-ordered, but it's the kind of subtley

So we actually do want to constrain all earlier reads and writes wrt
the final write. Which is exactly what "smp_store_release()" does.

But with our current list_empty_careful(), the smp_mb() is I think
technically sufficient.

> We need a barrier between "wait->flags |= WQ_FLAG_WOKEN" and list_del_init(),

See above: we need more than just that write barrier, although in
_practice_ you're right, and the other barriers actually all already
exist and are part of wake_up_state().

So the smp_mb() is unnecessary, and in fact your smp_wmb() would be
too. But I left it there basically as "documentation".

Again, this is what a proper list_empty_careful() with a
smp_load_acquire() would have automatically gotten for us.

But yes, I think that without that, and with the explicit barriers, we
need an smp_rmb() after the list_empty_careful().

I really think it should be _in_ list_empty_careful(), though. Or
maybe finish_wait(). Hmm.

Because looking at all the other finish_wait() uses, the fact that the
waitqueue _list_ is properly ordered isn't really a guarantee of the
rest of the stack space is.

In practice, it will be, but I think this lack of serialization is a
potential real bug elsewhere too.

(Obviously none of this would show on x86, where we already *get* that
smp_store_release/smp_load_acquire behavior for the existing
list_del_init()/list_empty_careful(), since all stores are releases,
and all loads are acquires)

So I think that is a separate issue, generic to our finish_wait() uses.
