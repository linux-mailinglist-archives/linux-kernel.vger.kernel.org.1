Neither fit the name=value style that all other events follow. What would fit 
the style is something like this:

cause=hashing_error  errno=-22
 
cause=alloc_entry errno=-12

Would this be OK? Also, errno is only to illustrate. You can name it 
something else as long as there are no use case collisions with our 
dictionary of field names.
