Thanks for the feedback! I think we can keep an eye on the API, the
idea to change to 0 isn't an unreasonable one. I have some other
multithreaded synthesis improving patches to send from Stephane, and
I've updated the benchmark to measure these. I'll re-send these
patches with the new single and multi-threaded benchmark data.

Thanks,
Ian
