Previous implementation is correct since longterm pins never end up in a CM=
A
managed memory with that implementation. It's just a different and suboptim=
al
implementation to exclude the CMA area. This is why I don't add the "Fixes"
tag on the patch.

Unfortunately, it's not possible to place it first in the series since
memalloc_nocma_XXX API has a bug that could return the CMA area even if
scope is set up. It is fixed on the first patch in this series.

My logic is that, we basically assume that using __GFP_MOVABLE is possible
in migration target allocation. And, it was necessarily cleared in
order to exclude
the CMA area. Now, we use the other method to exclude the CMA area so
__GFP_MOVABLE is added like usual. If you think that it deserves to be
a separate patch, I will do it on the next version.

Will document it.

Thanks.
