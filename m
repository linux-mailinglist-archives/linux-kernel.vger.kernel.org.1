Oh right, I was still in college when those SoCs were released ;)

Yes, that was my point as well that its probably not counted as a bug
by the hw designers. So I'm going to post setting HUPCF on QCOM
implementation with clear comments based on yours and Jordan's 
description
of this problem, but I wanted to have a way to set this only for GPU 
context
bank and not GMU as Jordan mentioned earlier that GMU doesnt need HUPCF 
set.
I was checking as to how do we map cb to device, if it was possible then 
we can have
a compatibility thing like we did for identity mapping. Any ideas Robin?

Thanks,
Sai
