So to clarify what you're saying, any system that boots successfully
with the default options is a sign of pure luck - regardless of being
builtin or modules.


And there you have my exact argument against the deferred timeout magic
going on in the driver core. But as you know people insist that it's
more important to be able to boot some defunct system from NFS than a
properly configured one reliably.

With all due respect, that's your downstream kernel, the upstream kernel
should not rely on luck, out-of-tree patches or kernel parameters.
