I agree with Michal that this really should be a user setting (something on
the command line or sysctl - allocation at the time of decision).

printk() was not safe in NMI context up until very recently.

You can also use the tracing ring buffer for this, as it has been safe in
all these contexts for a very long time. And that ring buffer is something
that you can use outside of tracing (oprofile uses it).

And both shouldn't be done within the kernel. The "CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_SILENT"
if for user decided policy, not the kernel making that policy for the user.
