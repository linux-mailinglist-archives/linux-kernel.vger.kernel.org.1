Here is the scenario I have in mind:

Two thread groups are created, A and B. Thread group B is created by
issuing clone from group A with flag CLONE_VM set, but not CLONE_THREAD.
Let's assume we have a single thread within each thread group (Thread A
and Thread B).

The AFAIU we can have:

Userspace variables:

int x = 0, y = 0;

CPU 0                   CPU 1
Thread A                Thread B
(in thread group A)     (in thread group B)

x = 1
barrier()
y = 1
exit()
exit_mm()
current->mm = NULL;
                        r1 = load y
                        membarrier()
                          skips CPU 0 (no IPI) because its current mm is NULL
                        r2 = load x
                        BUG_ON(r1 == 1 && r2 == 0)

Thanks,

Mathieu
