Hi Marco,

I reviewed patches and they look good to me (minus some local comments
that I've left).

The main question/concern I have is what Vlastimil mentioned re
long-aged objects.
Is the default sample interval values reasonable for typical
workloads? Do we have any guidelines on choosing the sample interval?
Should it depend on workload/use pattern?
By "reasonable" I mean if the pool will last long enough to still
sample something after hours/days? Have you tried any experiments with
some workload (both short-lived processes and long-lived
processes/namespaces) capturing state of the pool? It can make sense
to do to better understand dynamics. I suspect that the rate may need
to be orders of magnitude lower.

Also I am wondering about the boot process (both kernel and init).
It's both inherently almost the same for the whole population of
machines and inherently produces persistent objects. Should we lower
the rate for the first minute of uptime? Or maybe make it proportional
to uptime?

I feel it's quite an important aspect. We can have this awesome idea
and implementation, but radically lower its utility by using bad
sampling value (which will have silent "failure mode" -- no bugs
detected).

But to make it clear: all of this does not conflict with the merge of
the first version. Just having tunable sampling interval is good
enough. We will get the ultimate understanding only when we start
using it widely anyway.
