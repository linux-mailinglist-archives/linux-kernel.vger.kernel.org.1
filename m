I quite like the idea of supporting includes, as it'd make it easier
to have test hierarchies as well: fs/Kunitconfig could include
ext4/Kunitconfig and fat/Kunitconfig, for instance. If we're adding
something more complicated to the Kunitconfig files than just raw
config entries, there are other things we could do, too (personally,
I'd quite like to be able to list KUnit test modules to be loaded
someday, though that's a bit outside the scope of this discussion).

There are some issues with exactly how we format these that'll need to
be resolved: there are cases where there are multiple distinct "areas"
that need testing which share a subdirectory (something like lib/), so
just using directory paths with one Kunitconfig file per directory has
some limitations. At the same time, it's definitely nicer to be able
to just specify a directory where that works.

Here's what I propose (noting that, realistically, it's unlikely we'll
have time to build the perfect system straight away):

1. We've agreed that 'select' isn't the solution we want, so accept
this patch to get rid of it, and avoid using it elsewhere (I've done
this for the fat test[1]). Do we know if changing this now will
seriously break anyone's workflow (particularly if there's something
automated that'd break?)

2. Add support to kunit.py for loading an arbitrary kunitconfig,
rather than using the default one in the root or build dir. (e.g.,
kunit.py run [path_to_kunitconfig]). This'd let us create
per-subsystem/feature/etc kunitconfigs and use them straight away.
This'd still require people to pass in the kunitconfig path each time
they run the tests, but'd at least give maintainers a single command
they can use and recommend =E2=80=94 they'd just need to have a Kunitconfig
file somewhere in the tree with the tests they want people to run.
Maybe if you pass a directory path, it looks for "Kunitconfig" in that
directory, but otherwise it can be a file like
"lib/data-structres.Kunitconfig" or something which doesn't correspond
to a directory.

3. Add the include support, etc, to kunitconfig, so people working on
multiple subsystems can more easily run groups of tests. This may get
a little complicated if we care about handling things with conflicting
dependencies, so I don't want to hold up the first two on that.

How does that sound?
