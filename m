Yes, I do well remember that you are unhappy with this approach.
Unfortunately, thus far, there is no solution that makes all developers
happy.  You might be glad to hear that we are also looking into other
solutions, each of which makes some other developers unhappy.  So we
are at least not picking on you alone.  :-/

I suggest that you carefully re-read the thread following that email.

Given a choice between making users unhappy and making developers
unhappy, I will side with the users each and every time.
