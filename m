Does this mean that there are 32 different signals and they are all ORed
into the same interrupt line to trigger software action when something
happens?

Or does it mean that this register is used to pass multi-bit information
and when any such information is passed an interrupt will be triggered?
If so, what does that information mean? How is it tied into other Linux
drivers/subsystems?

In the Qualcomm case we have 32 bits in a register where each bit
written will trigger an interrupt elsewhere in the SoC, as such the
mailbox is purely write only and the "read" side is handled by some
interrupt-controller.

The three copies just sounds like 3 (or 3 * 32) different mailbox
channels.

I interpret Jassi's view as this is a channel that passes 32 bit
"messages".

But if writes to the register is ORed together than it seems like the
hardware isn't supposed to pass multi-bit messages, but instead is
supposed to carry 32 individual signals - somewhat similar to the
Qualcomm block.

I don't see a problem with having a cascaded IRQ handler for incoming
notifications.

So these 5 requests, are they conveyed by the signals [1,2,3,4,5] or
[BIT(0), BIT(1), BIT(2), BIT(3), BIT(4)]?

In the first case you have to serialize things given that e.g. signal 1
immediately followed by 2 is indistinguishable from 3.

If you signals are single-bit notifications then you don't need any
serialization.
