Hi Arnd!

(Please let's have this cross-posted for more visibility. I only learned about this
 while reading Phoronix news)

As far as I know, Yoshinori Sato is actively maintaining H8300 support, see:

I don't think this has reached any agreement yet. Multiple people want it to stay.

I'm still using this. Please keep it.

Dito. I have both sun3 and hp300 machines.

I don't see the point in crippling Alpha support. Does this achieve anything?

Isn't SH-2 basically J-2? I'm not sure what we would gain here.
