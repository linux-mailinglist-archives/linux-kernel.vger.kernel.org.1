Right, so this is expected. We can definitely make
__tsan_func_entry/exit disappear with Clang, with GCC it's going to be
a while if we want to fix it.

If we remove 'noinline' from __no_kcsan_or_inline, we no longer get
the call to __read_once_word_nocheck above! But...

For KCSAN we force 'noinline' because older compilers still inline and
then instrument small functions even if we just have the no_sanitize
attribute (without inline mentioned). The same is actually true for
KASAN, so KASAN's READ_ONCE_NOCHECK might be broken in a few places,
but nobody seems to have noticed [1]. KASAN's __no_kasan_or_inline
should also have a 'noinline' I think. I just tested
__no_kcsan_or_inline without 'noinline', and yes, GCC 9 still decided
to inline a small function and then instrument the accesses.

[1] https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=59600

The good news is that Clang does the right thing when removing
'noinline' from __no_kcsan_or_inline:
1. doesn't inline into functions that are instrumented, and
2. your above example doesn't do the call to __read_once_word_nocheck.

The obvious solution to this is: restrict which compiler we want to support?

If you want a solution now, here is one way to get us closer to where
we want to be:

1. Peter's patch to add data_race around __READ_ONCE/__WRITE_ONCE.
2. Patch to make __tsan_func_entry/exit disappear with Clang.
3. Remove 'noinline' from __no_kcsan_or_inline.
4. Patch to warn users that KCSAN may have problems with GCC and
should use Clang >= 7.

But this is probably only half a solution.

If you *also* want to fix __READ_ONCE etc not adding calls to
__no_sanitize functions:

5. Remove any mention of data_race and kcsan_check calls from
__{READ,WRITE}_ONCE, {READ,WRITE}_ONCE.  [Won't need #1 above.]
6. I'll send a patch to make KCSAN distinguish volatile accesses, and
we will require Clang 11.

That is *if* you insist on __no_sanitize to behave like you suggest.
Note that, at that point, I really don't know how to salvage GCC,
mainly because of fixing __no_sanitize with GCC looking hopeless.

Let me know what you prefer.

Thanks,
