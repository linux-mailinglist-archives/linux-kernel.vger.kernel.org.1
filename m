Sure. But my point was really that disabling stuff left and right just
so we can get to the finish line is fine for internal kernel-on-clang
development, but I'd expect the contributions upstream to be a bit
more considerate of other concerns, such as not regressing in terms of
functionality.

OK, so you are saying you need the Clang *assembler* to perform CI on
C pieces that we can now build with the Clang compiler, and we don't
want to regress on that? Is this because the cross-assemblers are
missing from the CI build hosts?

To be honest with you, I don't actually think iwmmxt is that
important. But I have already demonstrated how we can use a couple of
macros to emit the same instructions without resorting to bare
opcodes, so there is really no need to disable pieces left and right
because the Clang assembler does not support them outright - it just
needs someone to care enough about this, rather than rush through the
list with a tick the box attitude, and rip out the pieces that look a
bit too complicated.

So we need the Clang assembler for reproducible builds?

I don't think this point belongs in the 'why should we care about the
Clang assembler' list :-)

I think the 'all legacy needs to die' attitude is not particularly
helpful here. In the 32-bit Linux/ARM community, there are many people
who care about older systems, and spend a lot of time on keeping
things in a working order on platforms that Google or ARM have stopped
caring about long ago.
