I'm in favor of the way Arnd proposed.  It's more straightforward and
less code.

If you find the number of modules or the too much cutting out being
problematic, you can create a module snd-sof-intel-acpi and
snd-sof-intel-pci containing the driver table entries for all Intel
devices, too.  In the case, you'll still need some conditional calls
of intel-dsp-config there, but it's a good step for reducing the
Kconfig complexity.

Agreed, we'd like to keep less changes for 5.11 for now.


thanks,
