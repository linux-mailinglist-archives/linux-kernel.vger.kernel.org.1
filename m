The timeout used in SCMI is simply based on how long the Juno (?)
platform takes to reply in most cases.
Talking proper code-design, the timeout (if at all) shouldn't even be
a hardcoded value, but instead taken from the platform.

From the test case Sudeep last shared, the scmi usage on mhu doesn't
not even hit any bottleneck ... the test "failed" because of the too
small hardcoded timeout value. Otherwise the current code actually
shows better numbers.
We need some synthetic tests to bring the limitation to the surface. I
agree that there may be such a test case, however fictitious. For that
reason, I am ok with the doorbell mode.

I totally agree with one compat-string for one hardware. However, as
you said, unlike other device classes, the mailbox driver runs the
sumtotal of hardware and the remote firmware behaviour. Also the
implementations wouldn't share much, so I think a separate file+dt
will be better.  But I wanna get rid of this toothache that flares up
every season, so whatever.

Cheers!
