Yes, I agree. But coming back to what the patch does in the example:

W/ the patch, list_add_leaf_cfs_rq() is now called for cfs_b and since
cfs_b->tg->parent->cfs_a and cfs_a->on_list=1 the 'branch is now
connected' which means 'rq->tmp_alone_branch = &rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list'.

I.e. assert_list_leaf_cfs_rq() at the end of enqueue_task_fair() is not
barfing anymore.

W/o the patch, list_add_leaf_cfs_rq() called w/ cfs_c left the 'branch
open', it's not called on cfs_b and since cfs_a->on_list=1, the 3rd
for_each_sched_entity() in enqueue_task_fair() doesn't 'connect the
branch' so the assert fires.

What I don't immediately see is how can cfs_a be throttled (which causes
cfs_b -> cfs_c being a throttled hierarchy) and be on the list
(cfs_a->on_list=1) at the same time.

So the only thing how this could happen is when there was a task enqueue
in a parallel cfs_b' (another child of cfs_a) sub hierarchy just before
the example.

True, we go the 2nd if() condition in list_add_leaf_cfs_rq().

Yes.
