OK, I'll keep that size rating in mind.

Also I'll try to reason a bit verbosely. (Not my skill #1, sorry.)

I have already one more enhancement idea, but I'd like not to have > 1

conflicts).

What does this mean? Is there a kernel.org repo/branch with my patch?

I try my best while CCing, but some mailing lists seem to have 
(silently!) rejected my patch (see discussion on a previous version of 
my patch).

Does it matter whether I just feed the output of ...

perl scripts/get_maintainer.pl --separator , --norolestats 
0001-Replace-HTTP-links-with-HTTPS-ones-documentation.patch

... into Git send-email To: prompt or actually CC: (not To:) mailing lists?
