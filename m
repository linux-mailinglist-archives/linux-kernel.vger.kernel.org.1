Not all systems run unprivileged KVM. :)

Err, did I miss a separate 6-patch series? I can't find anything on lore.

Please no. This is way too much overhead for something that a system
owner wants to enforce globally. A sysctl is the correct option here,
IMO. If it needs to be a per-userns sysctl, that would be fine too.

I'd agree that patch 1 should land, as it appears to be required for any
further policy considerations. I'm still a big fan of a sysctl since
this is the kind of thing I would absolutely turn on globally for all my
systems.
