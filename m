No, this is what I get for replying while in a meeting ;-)

Yes, it's "before this event".

Yes. And I think we could make a local_time() wrapper of local_t to do
these updates for us. They don't need to be totally atomic, just appear
to be.

For this version I'm using local64_t for before_stamp. I'll look into
other ways to update it for 32 bit. Sequence updates should be easy to
implement (if it hasn't already).

Not if it breaks user space. 10 years ago I may have considered a
change like that, but not today.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean. The outer most event only
cares that its timestamp is:

 1) In order between other events in the buffer
 2) Exists between the time the event started recording and the time it
    finished recording. As the caller doesn't care where the timestamp
    lies within that event.

This is true even if this trace happens within a nesting event.
