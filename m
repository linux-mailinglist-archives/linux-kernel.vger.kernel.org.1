I'm not 100% sure if this is exactly what Tao pointed out here but I
also had difficulties understanding understanding how this patch works:

                       p.se
                        |
      __________________|
      |
      V
     cfs_c -> tg_c ->  se_c (se->on_rq = 1)
                        |
      __________________|
      |
      v
     cfs_b -> tg_b ->  se_b
                        |
      __________________|
      |
      V
     cfs_a -> tg_a ->  se_a
                        |
      __________________|
      |
      V
     cfs_r -> tg_r
      |
      V
      rq

(1) The incomplete update happens with cfs_c at the end of
    enqueue_entity() in the first loop because of 'if ( .... ||
    cfs_bandwidth_used())' (cfs_b->on_list=0 since cfs_a is throttled)

(2) se_c breaks out of the first loop (se_c->on_rq = 1)

(3) With the patch cfs_b is added back to the list.
    But only because cfs_a->on_list=1.

But since cfs_a is throttled it should be cfs_a->on_list=0 as well.
throttle_cfs_rq()->walk_tg_tree_from(..., tg_throttle_down, ...) should
include cfs_a when calling list_del_leaf_cfs_rq().

IMHO, throttle_cfs_rq() calls tg_throttle_down() for the throttled
cfs_rq too.


Another thing: Why don't we use throttled_hierarchy(cfs_rq) instead of
cfs_bandwidth_used() in enqueue_entity() as well?
