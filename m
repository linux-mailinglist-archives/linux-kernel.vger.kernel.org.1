There's only two places that wait on the mutex, and all other places
try to get it, and if it fails, it simply exits.

What I would do is introduce a kexec_busy counter, and have something
like this:

For the two locations that actually wait on the mutex:

loop:
	mutex_lock(&kexec_mutex);
	ret = atomic_inc_return(&kexec_busy);
	if (ret > 1) {
		/* Atomic context is busy on this counter, spin */
		atomic_dec(&kexec_busy);
		mutex_unlock(&kexec_mutex);
		goto loop;
	}
	[..]
	atomic_dec(&kexec_busy);
	mutex_unlock(&kexec_mutex);

And then all the other places that do the trylock:

	cant_sleep();
	ret = atomic_inc_return(&kexec_busy);
	if (ret > 1) {
		atomic_dec(&kexec_busy);
		return;
	}
	[..]
	atomic_dec(&kexec_busy);
