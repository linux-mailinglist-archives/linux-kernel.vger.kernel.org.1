Can we still edit the change logs, maybe that is a clear indication
that they are not sufficiently clear, when one don't understand the
patch without following the whole email thread.

The problem we have here is that *another* thread can change no_new_privs
of the execve thread, that is a write.  I think that must be avoided
whatever it costs.  Those are the hard issues,
and reading another thread's credentials, an taking a reference of the
vm need to be consistent, so should just not happen while the vm
is updated, but the credentials not yet.

Or am I missing something here?

previously that was bprm->mm == NULL, that is even more hacky.

Linus, I take full responsibility for this part of the patch.
In this case, I just did not want to change the name again.
That name was in a previous version of my patch, that I merged
with Eric's and at the same time had to fix the mutex-lock-order
issue in Eric's original patch.  But if anybody would have
suggested a better name, and advised me to pass a parameter to
exec_mmap that would have happened.
So a kind of laziness on my side, and unfortunately I forgot to
point to all the changes in a revision log, I usually do that,
but this time I forgot it somehow.  This was a 16-part patch
series at that time, so I just was really busy with following
each mail of the previous patch version, and also get the latest
revision of the change log (I use the mail maybe I should have
pulled Eric's tree, but I am still a newbie here ... :-) ).
Anyhow I was surprised that Eric did not see my changes by
looking at them, but that is the human nature, nothing to be
blamed for.

Names can be changed.  In the peer review everybody was happy with it.
But that is not set in stone.

Initially I only wanted to address the ptrace attach, but Eric
came up with the user mode page fault handler, that made the patch
a lot more complicated, if that goal is dropped, also the place
where the mutex need to be taken could be a different one.

Can be done.  I don't care.  It is one additional register taken
with a parameter to exec_mmap and it is probably inlined, nothing
more nothing less.

The error handling is sometimes called when the exec_update_mutex is
not taken, in fact even de_thread not called.

Can you say how you would suggest that to be done?
