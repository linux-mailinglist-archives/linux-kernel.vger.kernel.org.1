Yeah, one of the things I discussed with Harshad is we really need a
test that looks like generic/472, but which is in shared/NNN, and
which unconditionally tries to use swapon for those file systems where
swapfiles are expected to work.  This is actually the second
regression caused by our breaking swapfile support (the other being
the iomap bmap change), which escaped our testing because we didn't
notice that generic/472 was skipped.

(Mental note; perhaps we should have a way of flagging tests that are
skipped when previously they would run in the {kvm,gce}-xfstests
framework.)
