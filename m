Maybe unsigned long is more appropriate? Do we rely on 32-bits vs.
64-bits?

It looks like this could be tested by checking for
drv->rsc_pm.notifier_call being non-NULL?

Can we have a different function that is called for the case where
solver mode is present and where solver mode isn't present? It would be
good to clearly show that rpmh_flush() thinks it is being called from
the last CPU vs. from some other random place because the code is
assuming solver vs. non-solver enabled state. It would be clearer from
the call site too.
