I do not see it in RT kernel. The waiting primitives, see the wait.c,
use sleepable locks all over the file.

What do you mean Michal? gfp_mask 0 != GFP_NOWAIT:

#define GFP_NOWAIT (__GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM)

it does wakeup of the kswapd. Or am i missing something? Please comment.
If we are about to avoid the kswapd, should we define something special?

#define GFP_NOWWAKE_KSWAPD 0

No. That was just another example illustrating how to bypass the
__GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM.

Same view on it.
