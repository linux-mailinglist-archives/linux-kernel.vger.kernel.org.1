s/GPs/unnecessary GPs/?  Plus "." at end of the sentence.

Yes, that is one reason RCU softirq might run again.

I can't think of a case where this request helps.  How about: "but
it still unnecessarily requests GP X+1"?

So the reductions in wakeups ranges from 5% to 40%, with almost a 20%
overall reduction in wakeups across all the runs.  That should be of
some use to someone.  ;-)

I do run rcutorture quite a bit, but is there a more real-world
benchmark that could be tried?

In this case, only the GP number of NEXT_READY_TAIL would be updated,
correct?  Or am I missing something subtle in the loop just past the
end of this patch?
