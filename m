This is what I was thinking about looking at. But it may make sense 
instead to extend the regulator API to allow multiple regualtor_get() 
calls for a single device. I haven't had time to dig into how difficult 
this would be.

 From what I can see in the code, just silencing the warning would lead 
to 'odd' behaviour with debugfs. The first struct regulator Panfrost 
acquires is the one that is used purely for turning the GPU on (no 
voltage scaling). The second struct regulator is the one which is 
obtained by the OPP framework. However the debugfs entries point into 
the actual struct regulator, so it would be far more logical/useful if 
those were pointing into the second struct regulator.

Ideally calling regulator_get a second time for the same device would 
simply return the same struct regulator object (with a reference count 
increment).

Perhaps a better approach would be for Panfrost to hand over the struct 
regulator objects it has already got to the OPP framework. I.e. open 
code dev_pm_opp_set_regulators(), but instead of calling 
regulator_get_optional() simply populate the regulators we already have?

The other benefit of that is it would provide a clear hand-over of 
responsibility between Panfrost handling it's own regulators and the OPP 
framework picking up the work. The disadvantage is that Panfrost would 
have to track whether the regulators have been handed over or not.
