If only life were simple.

In light of https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02307 which managed to
demonstrate that the original KAISER was actually a speculative attack
and nothing to do with the prefetch instruction, a discussion about
same-mode training happened.

The updated recommendation given was to continue using retpoline as well
as eIBRS to prevent same-mode training of the syscall indirect branch. 
Josh (CC'd) has been doing a lot of work to find and fix other
speculative leaks in this area.

For Skylake uarch and later, even if an RSB underflow leads to a BTB
lookup, it still requires an interrupt/NMI to hit one of two instruction
boundaries to empty the RSB, and an attacker with that level of control
probably has more interesting things to be trying to do.

Without retpoline (or something even more expensive such as IRET-ing
around), an attacker can still create speculative type confusion between
different system calls, when eIBRS is active.

Once you mix CET-SS in, this breaks, unless you're prepared to update
the retpoline gadget to include a WRSS to modify the shadow stack
alongside the regular stack.  Add this to the large pile of fun for
whomever has the privileg^W chore of implementing supervisor CET support.

I agree.  The reason for using a retpoline here in the first place is
unclear.
