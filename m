We did hit these two bugs recently while June was testing a platform 
based of 410c.

we had to these 2 fixes in his dev branch

https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/MCbpBgH7JV/

and a hack:
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/GYDSDmJt7Y/

I got side tracked with other stuff, so I could not cleanup the lpass 
hack patch to send it!

With this two patches June was able to test all the usecases for 410c.

Yes, this basically overwritten some of the defines. Specially 
MI2S_TERTIARY and MI2S_QUATERNARY

We should probably consolidate these defines to a single lpass.h file in 
include/dt-bindings/ and not split them into soc specific.

My tests are pretty basic headset/speaker playback cases, this basically 
tests PRIMARY and SECONDARY MI2S and not MI2S_TERTIARY or QUAT MI2S.

June reported this to me some time during Christmas.

Look forward to review your patches!
