Thanks for the reference! That patch fixes the problem I had with code
cache resizing so the workaround above is no longer necessary.

I tried this with latest perf/core and JDK 11 but I don't see any
[unknown] from jitted-*.so. All the events are in "Interpreter": I think
the options you want are -Xcomp -Xbatch rather than -XX:CompileOnly=1?
The latter restricts compilation to the named method/package.

There was a bug where no jitdump debug info was written for classes
compiled without line tables. That was fixed by d3ea46da3 ("perf jvmti:
Fix jitdump for methods without debug info").
