Has that actually happened?

You still need to fix the chain of trust in all the relevant browsers 
(unless you're planning to ship root certificates with the kernel source).

Even then, developers using "HTTPS Everywhere" or equivalent will not 
benefit from this patch.

And these new links are just as stale as the old ones, so I have to use 
web.archive.org anyway. So this patch achieves practically nothing.

Should developers be more concerned about MITM attack or lawsuit?

Will you also require developers to use DNSSEC?
