Hi Vincent, which OS are you using? We found the regression on Clear OS,
but it cannot reproduce on Debian.
On https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=mac-win-linux2018&num=5
it was mentioned that -
Gzip compression is much faster out-of-the-box on Clear Linux due to it exploiting
multi-threading capabilities compared to the other operating systems Gzip support.
