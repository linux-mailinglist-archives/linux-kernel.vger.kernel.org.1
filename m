No serious problem. I found it just when I was working on adding support of
pci expander bridge for Arm in QEMU. I found the IO window of some extended
root bus could not be registered when I inserted the extended buses' _CRS
info into DSDT table in the x86 way, which does not sort the buses.

Though root buses should be sorted in QEMU, would it be better to accept
those non-ascending IO windows?

BTW, for b, it seems to be no space between IO windows of different root buses
generated by EDK2. Or maybe I missed something obvious.

Thanks,
Jiahui
