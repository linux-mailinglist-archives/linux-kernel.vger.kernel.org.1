Why is the genpd being powered off at all? It looks like the driver is
written in a way that it doesn't expect this to happen. See where
adsp_pds_disable() is called from. Looks like the remoteproc "stop"
callback should be called or the driver should be detached.

It sort of looks like the genpd is expected to be at the max level all
the time (it sets INT_MAX in adsp_pds_enable(), cool). Maybe we need to
add some sort of suspend hooks to the remote proc driver instead? Where
those suspend hooks are called earlier and drop the genpd performance
state request but otherwise leave it enabled across suspend?

I know this isn't clearing the land mine that is calling this code from
noirq phase of suspend, but I'm just looking at the driver and thinking
that it never expected to be called from this phase of suspend to begin
with.
