I agree that currently THP allocation does not provide a strong guarantee=

like hugetlbfs, which can pre-allocate pages at boot time. For users like=

RT KVM and such, pre-allocated hugetlb might be the only choice, since
allocating huge pages from CMA (either hugetlb or 1GB THP) would fail
if some pages are pinned and scattered in the CMA that could prevent
huge page allocation.

In other cases, if the user can tolerate fall backs but do not like the
unpredictable huge page formation outcome, we could add an madvise()
option like Michal suggested [1], so the user will know whether he gets
huge pages or not and can act accordingly.

Romand and Jason have provided some use cases [2,3]
