Yeah, it's kinda amazing how much of a delay there is sometimes.
Perhaps all of the kgdb users are off on downstream kernels so they
only notice changes when they re-sync up.

OK, makes sense.

OK, fair enough.  You're the maintainer so it's your view on the
matter that's the most important.  I guess one worry I have is that if
neither you nor I really understand the code path that a theoretical
system would take if it didn't already have its interrupts disabled
it'll be hard to keep from breaking it in making other changes to kgdb
in the future.

Anyway, enough discussion for now.  ;-)  My v2 should work like you
suggested and I'm not planning on any other short term changes to this
function, so we should be all good right now.
