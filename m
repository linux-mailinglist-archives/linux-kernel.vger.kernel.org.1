Clear. The opposite thing is /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches limit that
will affect Perf tool usage additionally to the current process limit on 
a number of simultaneously open file descriptors (ulimit -n). So move to 
epoll() will impose one limit what can affect Perf tool scalability.

I wouldn't treat it as a hack but more as a fix because returned
pos is now a part of interface that can be safely used in callers.
Can we go with this fix for the patch set?

Thanks,
