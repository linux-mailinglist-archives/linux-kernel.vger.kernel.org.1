That also a fine good solution, albeit more complex than just using the 
existing custom ratelimit_state infrastructure. Doing so probably also means 
we'd miss out on some of the other stuff that comes for free with it.

My only other concern with ratelimiting per-TGID or per-MSR was that the 
ratelimit cache table could become unwieldy, but if we keep it simple by 
limiting the size and not printing after we reach that, that sounds fine too.

Any solution which means that we avoid saturating kmsg for workloads which 
currently twiddle MSRs sounds fine to me. People should know that we don't 
support or encourage this, but it shouldn't be at the cost of potentially 
pushing everything else out of the kmsg buffer.
