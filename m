That's not a technical argument.

If races are a problem, it doesn't matter that they're rare. If
they're not a problem, it doesn't matter that they're frequent.

From Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst:

 - It must fix a real bug that bothers people (not a, "This could be a
   problem..." type thing).

There hasn't been a mention of this affecting real workloads in the
submission history of this patch, so it doesn't qualify for -stable.
