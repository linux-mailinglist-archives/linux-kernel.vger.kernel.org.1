This was discussed in the past.
For now the focus is migrating existing logging to the new drm_ based
logging. Preferably using coccinelle.
when we are more or less covered there we can discuss if we will add
more logging functions.

Please note this in the changelog when you resend.
I delete your original patches so they are gone now from my mail-box.
Yeah, could dig them up somewhere, but it is easier to let you resend
them and then we can have an updated changelog too.
