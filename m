No, ignore this part (which you explained well it was just a thinko,
and your patch of course would not have worked if this was the case):
the exclusive wake up doesn't get lost if schedule() was called because
state goes back to running regardless of what woke it.

I still prefer if it can be changed to the below fix though.
