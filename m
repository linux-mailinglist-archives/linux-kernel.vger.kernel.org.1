That makes sense, however, having each operation as an objtool 
subcommand doesn't solve that issue, right? Each invocation of objtool 
will re-read the elf object.

I guess having all the relevant code in objtool as subcommand would be a 
first step towards that goal.

I'm no maintainer nor know their feeling about this and I haven't been 
part of the initial discussion. My main concern was about the approach 
of moving existing subcommand code to arch specific folders.

Thanks for the explanations.
