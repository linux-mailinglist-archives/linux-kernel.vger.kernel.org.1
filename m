So we have

    gcfs --> tg --> gse
     ________________|
     |
     V

    cfs ---> tg (root)

     |
     V

    rq


here. What is 'child rq' for 'group se' here? I guess 'parent cfs_rq' is
cfs_rq.

divider uses cfs_rq but we sync se->avg.util_avg with gcfs_rq here.

But since avg.period_contrib of cfs_rq and gcfs_rq are the same this
should work.

Looks like that avg.last_update_time of se (group entity), it's gcfs_rq
and cfs_rq is always the same in update_tg_cfs_[util\|runnable].

So that means the PELT windows are aligned for cfs_rqs and group se's?

And if we want to enforce this for cfs_rq and task, we have
sync_entity_load_avg().
