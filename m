Good point.  But, isn't it ok to use Accessed bit as long as PG_Idle and
PG_Young is adjusted properly?  Current DAMON implementation does so, as
idle_page_tracking also does.

That said, the core logics of DAMON and the underlying access check primitive
are logically seperated.  I am planning[1] to further entirely seperate those
and let users to be able to use right access check promitive for their needs.

If I'm missing something, please let me know.
