Why ? Branch distance limits ? You can't use trampolines ?

I dislike the kernel being in the vmalloc space (see my other email)
but I don't understand the specific issue with modules.

Out of curiosity why would relocatable kernels introduce a significant
hit ? Where about do you see the overhead coming from ?
