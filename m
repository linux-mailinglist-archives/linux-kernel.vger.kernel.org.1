I think the fudging is nonsensical to begin with, as I would have
expected that PERF_REGS_ABI_32 should be the same layout regardless of
consumer (and therefore should be identical to the 32-bit arm native
format). I realise that doesn't change that we might be stuck with it...

Agreed; I will try to figure out what the perf tool does in the three
cases above. I would be grateful if others could take a look too.

Another slightly scary thought: what happens for a 32-bit perf with a
64-bit application being profiled? I don't see how that'd be forbidden,
but I also don't see how it'd work.

I agree that in that case we'd have to keep the existing bodge, and we'd
have to special-case the PC, but I'd prefer to split the logic for case
1 into a separate function for cases 2 and 3 so that we can more easily
avoid getting this more confused.

Let's figure out what userspace does first...

Thanks,
Mark.
