The tl;dr version is that without this commit we had failing fork tests
in CRIU [1] :)

The issue we had was when fork() in a monitored process happened
concurrently with "background copy" of pages into the process address
space during a post-copy process migration.

The userspace has no way to tell who won the race for mmap_lock and
depending on that we can have two different cases:

* fork() took the mmap_lock, pages in the parent are still empty, so
they will be empty in the child

* userfaultfd_copy() won the lock, there is data in the parent and the
child's inherits these mappings

The uffd monotor should *know* what is the state of child's memory and
without this patch it could only guess.

There is also mmap_lock involved, so I don't see how copy can start in
parallel with fork processing. Fork sets mmap_chaning to true while
holding mmap_lock, so copy cannot start in parallel. When mmap_lock is
realeased, mmap_chaning remains true until fork event is pushed to
userspace and when this is done there is no issue with
userfaultfd_copy.

Maybe I am missing something...
