Yeah, I saw that, I think I even reviewed or tested some early version
of it :)

This part isn't clear to me. How would the DT look like? Would it have a
single node per physical hub chip or one node for each 'logical' hub?
Similarly, would there be a single plaform device or multiple?

I guess when registering the platform device we could pass it the
corresponding DT node, to allow it to determine its regulators, GPIOs,
etc during probe.

What exactly is removal? It seems once the hub is 'removed' it could never be
probed again because the platform device that is in charge of the
initialization is only created when the USB controller is initialized. I have
the impression that the platform device would have to exist as long as the USB
controller.
