Sorry but I did not understand your point. We are talking about the
capabilities of coresight etm tracing which has the instruction level
tracing and a lot more. Perf subsystem is just the framework used for 
it.
In other words, its not the perf subsystem which does instruction level
tracing, its the coresight etm. Why the perf subsystem should be
modified to lockdown kernel mode? If we were to let perf handle all the
trace filtering for different exception levels, then why do we need
the register settings in coresight etm driver to filter out NS EL*
tracing? And more importantly, how do you suppose we handle sysfs mode
of coresight tracing with perf subsystem?

Thanks,
Sai
