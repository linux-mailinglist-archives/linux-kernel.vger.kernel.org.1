nit: please use a 12-character ID here.

another nit: tsk is now unused, so this generates a compiler warning:


arch/arm64/kernel/signal.c:787:22: warning: unused variable 'tsk' [-Wunused-variable]
        struct task_struct *tsk = current;
                            ^
1 warning generated.


Also, the si_code used by signal_setup_done seems to be SIGTRAP, whereas
we usually set TRAP_TRACE. What's the correct behaviour here? Looks like x86
uses TRAP_BRKPT... :/
