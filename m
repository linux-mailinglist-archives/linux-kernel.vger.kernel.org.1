Thanks, this is useful info. Now I know that my patch isn't somehow
reordering devices that would have probed as soon as
of_platform_default_populate_init() added them.

When you say the "The affected drivers are still probed in the same
order", are you only referring to the devices that would have probed
before of_platform_default_populate_init() returns? Or ALL devices in
the system are probing in the same order?

I assume gpio-keys gets probed in the "normal init thread" and not by
the deferred probe workqueue? I'm guessing this because gpio_keys
driver seems to register during late_initcall() whereas
of_platform_default_populate_init() runs as an arch_initcall_sync().

I tried digging into the gpio_keys driver code to see how it interacts
with INTC and if gpio-keys defers probe if INTC hasn't probed yet. But
it seems like a rabbit hole that'd be easier to figure out when you
have the device. Can you check if gpio-keys is probing before INTC in
the "bad" case?

Also, in general, can you see if there's a difference in the probe
order between all the devices in the system? Adding a log to
really_probe() would be better in case non-platform devices are
getting reordered (my change affects all devices that are created from
DT, not just platform devices).

I want to make sure we understand the real issue before we try to fix it.

Thanks,
Saravana
