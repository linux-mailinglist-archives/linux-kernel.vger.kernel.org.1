Subject: [PATCH V4] mm/vmstat: Add events for THP migration without split
Date:   Thu,  9 Jul 2020 15:09:43 +0530
Message-Id: <1594287583-16568-1-git-send-email-anshuman.khandual@arm.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add following new vmstat events which will help in validating THP migration
without split. Statistics reported through these new VM events will help in
performance debugging.

1. THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS
2. THP_MIGRATION_FAIL
3. THP_MIGRATION_SPLIT

In addition, these new events also update normal page migration statistics
appropriately via PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS and PGMIGRATE_FAIL. While here, this
updates current trace event 'mm_migrate_pages' to accommodate now available
THP statistics.

+Monitoring Migration
+=====================
+
+The following events (counters) can be used to monitor page migration.
+
+1. PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS: Normal page migration success. Each count means that a
+   page was migrated. If the page was a non-THP page, then this counter is
+   increased by one. If the page was a THP, then this counter is increased by
+   the number of THP subpages. For example, migration of a single 2MB THP that
+   has 4KB-size base pages (subpages) will cause this counter to increase by
+   512.
+
+2. PGMIGRATE_FAIL: Normal page migration failure. Same counting rules as for
+   _SUCCESS, above: this will be increased by the number of subpages, if it was
+   a THP.
+
+3. THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS: A THP was migrated without being split.
+
+4. THP_MIGRATION_FAIL: A THP could not be migrated nor it could be split.
+
+5. THP_MIGRATION_SPLIT: A THP was migrated, but not as such: first, the THP had
+   to be split. After splitting, a migration retry was used for it's sub-pages.
+
+THP_MIGRATION_* events also update the appropriate PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS or
+PGMIGRATE_FAIL events. For example, a THP migration failure will cause both
+THP_MIGRATION_FAIL and PGMIGRATE_FAIL to increase.
