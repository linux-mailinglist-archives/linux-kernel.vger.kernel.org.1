I'd recommend to place it at specific address, otherwise it will play badly with
CONFIG_MPU=y. MPU covers only single contiguous memblock (due to limitations
in number of available MPU regions), so placing DMA pool anywhere may result
in split of such contiguous memblock, as effect you may see that some memory
is not used. Usually, folks place DMA pool at the end of RAM.

Bear in mind that with CONFIG_MPU=y XIP start address need to be aligned to 1M.
