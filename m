So yes! An earlier version of the CMA heap I submitted did add all CMA
regions as accessible heaps as you propose here.

However, the concern was that in some cases, those regions are device
specific reserved memory that the driver is probably expecting to have
exclusive access. To allow (sufficiently privileged, or misconfigured)
userland to be able to allocate out of that seemed like it might cause
trouble, and instead we should have CMA regions explicitly exported.
There was some proposal to add a dt property to the reserved memory
section (similar to linux,cma-default) and use that to do the
exporting, but other discussions seemed to prefer having drivers
export it explicitly in a fashion very similar to what your earlier
patch does. The only trouble is we just need an upstream driver to add
such a call in the series before we can merge it.
