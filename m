The lock has to be held by the time 'new' is findable because 'new' is
not completely constructed at that point.  The finder will try to acquire
the spinlock before looking at the uninitialised fields, so it's safe.
But it's not a common idiom we use at all.

I think I can rewrite this to take the spinlock after doing the allocation.
