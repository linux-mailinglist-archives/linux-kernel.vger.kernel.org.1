Agreed. However, since kprobes related tracing tools are layered
to provide different features (e.g. kprobes abstructs sw breakpoint,
ftrace kprobe-events provides a minimum CUI, and perf-probe provides
binary analysis, etc.), this issue should be solved by user-level
binary analysis layer. (it is not good idea to analyze the optimized
code in kernel)

OK, let me try to fix this in perf-probe since that is the simplest
binary analysis part in user-space.
