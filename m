I am fully aware that a complete isolation is hard to achieve. I am just
trying evaluate how is this specific usecase worth a new interface that
we will have to maintain for ever. Especially when I suspect that the
interface will likely only paper over immediate problems rather than
offer a long term maintainable solution for it.

I remember those. My understanding was that the only problem is to
properly account for CPU on behalf of the reclaimed cgroup and that has
been work in progress for that.

Outsourcing all that to userspace surely sounds like an attractive
option but it comes with usual user API price. More on that later.

Understood. But isn't this an implementation detail of zswap? Can it
offload some of the heavy lifting to a different context and reduce the
general overhead?

This information is definitely useful and having it in the changelog
would be useful. IIUC the only reason why you cannot use high limit
to control this pro-active reclaim is the potential throttling due to
expensive reclaim, correct?

You are right that misconfigured limits can result in problems. But such
a configuration should be quite easy to spot which is not the case for
targetted reclaim calls which do not leave any footprints behind.
Existing interfaces are trying to not expose internal implementation
details as much as well. You are proposing a very targeted interface to
fine control the memory reclaim. There is a risk that userspace will
start depending on a specific reclaim implementation/behavior and future
changes would be prone to regressions in workloads relying on that. So
effectively, any user space memory reclaimer would need to be tuned to a
specific implementation of the memory reclaim. My past experience tells
me that this is not a great thing for maintainability of neither kernel
nor the userspace part.

All that being said, we really should consider whether the proposed
interface is trying to work around existing limitations in the reclaim
or the interface. If this is the former then I do not think we should be
adding it. If the later then we should discuss on how to improve our
existing interfaces (or their implementations) to be better usable and
allow your usecase to work better.

What is your take on that Johannes?
