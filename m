I am sure that your patches here have nothing to do with it, just
inside mesa since
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/commit/c56fe4118a2dd991ff1b2a532c0f234eddd435e9
it's broken on the jetson nano and because it's so old I am not able
to tell if this is because of some kernel changes or because of the
modifier code inside mesa being slightly broken.

Maybe you have an idea, but Thierry knows about the issue, but I think
he never was able to reproduce it on any system.
