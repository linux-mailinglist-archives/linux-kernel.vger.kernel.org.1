"iommus" property is not about inheriting stream mapping from 
bootloader,
it is used to enable SMMU address translation for the corresponding
master when specified. So when you have disabled bypass, i.e.,
ARM_SMMU_DISABLE_BYPASS_BY_DEFAULT=y or via cmdline 
"arm-smmu.disable_bypass=1"
and iommus property with SID and mask is not specified, then it will 
result
in SMMU global faults.

Downstream has bypass enabled(ARM_SMMU_DISABLE_BYPASS_BY_DEFAULT=n),so 
you
won't see any global faults if you do not have iommus property.

Patch in your link is for display because of the usecase for splash 
screen
on android and some other devices where the bootloader will configure 
SMMU,
it has not yet merged and not likely to get merged in the current state.

So yes "there is *not* much more to it than bypass is disabled by 
default now"
and you have to specify "iommus" for the master devices or you should 
enable bypass,
i.e., ARM_SMMU_DISABLE_BYPASS_BY_DEFAULT=n or arm-smmu.disable_bypass=n

Try without the patch in the link and without iommus for UFS and
ARM_SMMU_DISABLE_BYPASS_BY_DEFAULT=y and you will see.
