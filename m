There is when the VM is struggling, but not necessarily when there is
simply a high, concurrent rate of short-lived file cache allocations.

Kswapd can easily reclaim gigabytes of clean page cache each second,
but there might be enough allocation concurrency from other threads to
starve a kfree_rcu() that only makes a very cursory attempt at getting
memory out of being able to snap up some of those returns.

In that scenario it makes sense to be a bit more persistent, or even
help scale out the concurrency of reclaim to that of allocations.

Yes, although I would add

	o	After making more than one attempt at the freelist to
		prevent merely losing races when the allocator/reclaim
		subsystem is mobbed by a high concurrency of requests.

__GFP_NORETRY (despite its name) accomplishes this.

__GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL is yet more persistent, but may retry for quite a
while if the allocation keeps losing the race for a page. This
increases the chance of the allocation eventually suceeding, but also
the risk of 1) trying to get memory for longer than a
synchronize_rcu() might have taken and 2) exerting more temporary
memory pressure on the workload* than might be productive.

So I'm inclined to suggest __GFP_NORETRY as a starting point, and make
further decisions based on instrumentation of the success rates of
these opportunistic allocations.

* Reclaim and OOM handling will be fine since no reserves are tapped
