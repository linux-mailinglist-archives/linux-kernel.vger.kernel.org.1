OK, I see. Maybe it's clearer to refer to child cfs_rq as gcfs_rq in
this context.

I agree.

But the decay windows (avg.last_update_time, avg.period_contrib) of
cfs_rq and gcfs_rq are not always aligned, I guess?

I see they are not after the online_fair_sched_group() ->
attach_entity_cfs_rq() but later the are in sync as well.

I ran a couple of different rt-app taskgroup tests and try to

BUG_ON(se->avg.period_contrib != gcfs_rq->avg.period_contrib);
BUG_ON(se->avg.last_update_time != gcfs_rq->avg.last_update_time)

in update_tg_cfs_util() but they didn't trigger so far.

Both, cfs_rq and gcfs_rq are in sync in update_tg_cfs_util() before and
during a task runs in gcfs_rq.

Are there cases where this wouldn't necessary happen in
update_tg_cfs_util(), maybe a more complicated testcase?

I agree.

I agree, this is not what you want to achieve here.
But syncing 'last_update_time' and 'period_contrib' is what I understand
as aligning the decay window (like in attach_entity_load_avg()).
