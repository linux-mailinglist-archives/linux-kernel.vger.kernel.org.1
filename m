Or it could be loaded over the network in encrypted form by the
enclave itself.

Sean, admirably, wants to peer into the future and set the driver up
from an architectural perspective, to future proof it for the
imposition of security controls.  So it would seem helpful to peer a
bit.

If I can paraphrase/simplify the discussion to date; the best the
kernel can do with respect to SGX is to impose controls, via mprotect,
that limit the maximum permissions of an enclave page to whatever was
specified when the enclave was loaded/initialized.

So here is the question that would seem to need answering:

Is this even a relevant control if we cede the notion of dynamically
loadable enclave code, which is the objective of SGX2 hardware, which
will in all likelihood be the only relevant hardware implementation in
the future?

The answer to this could very well be yes if the objective is to
provide a method for a platform owner to explicitly block dynamically
loadable enclave code.  Since there seems to be a desire for immense
clarity in the changelogs surrounding all of this, framing the
discussion in something practical like this may be of assistance.

One of the desires of the SGX user community is to not allow
visibility into enclave code, this is one of the notions/objectives of
confidential computing.  The Protected Code Loader that was added by
Intel to their PSW is an acknowledgement of this fact.  EDMM and
dynamically loadable code makes doing this much more efficient so that
would seem to be the face of the future.

My apologies for 'delaying' the driver even more.  I was accused of
that about a year ago but it appears I didn't do too much
damage... :-)

Best wishes for a productive week.
