Thanks very much for writing the test. I do think that it goes a
little outside what we'd normally expect of a unit test (notably with
the issues around determinism and threading), but it's good to see
KUnit being pushed in new directions a bit.

The biggest issue in my mind is the possibility that the
non-determinism of the tests could cause false positives. If we're
trying to run as many KUnit tests as possible as part of continuous
integration systems or as a condition for accepting patches, having
flaky tests could be annoying. The KCSAN tests seem to break/fail
as-is when run on single-core machines (at least, under qemu), so some
way of documenting this as a requirement would probably be necessary,
too.

One possibility would be to add support for "skipped" tests to KUnit
(the TAP specification allows for it), so that the KCSAN test could
detect cases where it's not reliable, and skip itself (leaving a note
as to why). In the short term, though, we'd absolutely need some
documentation around the dependencies for the test.

(For the record, the failures I saw were all due to running under qemu
emulating as a uniprocessor/single-core machine: with
CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY, it would just hang after creating the first
couple of threads. With CONFIG_PREEMPT, the tests completed, but the
majority of them failed.)

This is something we've discussed here a couple of times as well.
While I'll confess to being a little bit wary of having tests rely too
heavily on console output: it risks being a bit fragile if the exact
contents or formatting of messages change, or ends up having a lot of
string formatting and/or parsing code in the tests. I do agree,
though, that it probably needs to be at least a part of testing things
like sanitizers where the ultimate goal is to produce console output.
I'm not exactly sure how we'd implement it yet, so it's probably not
going to happen extremely soon, but what you have here looks to me
like a good example we can generalise as needed.

Cheers,
