Seems now we have different opinions on this:

- Hao thinks self-consistent is important to dfl framework.
- "dfl" for everything seems not preferable to Greg.
- From your previous mail, I assume you prefer to keep the bus name as "dfl"
but change the stuff for other subsystem, is it?

So I got a little stuck here.

Do you think "dfl-fpga" for everything would be an acceptable solution
for you?
