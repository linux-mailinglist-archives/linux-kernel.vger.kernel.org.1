I interpreted that as "any URLs [changed by this patch]". I wanted no
URLs you changed to be removed nor not HTTPSified.

(You seem to be saying "any URLs [in the file]".)

The URL I commented on was not valid and not changed by your patch.

You sent me a patch to update URLs, gave me (seemingly) explicit
instructions about which things would cause you to undo individual
changes, none of which seemed to trigger, so I offered an improvement,
that would add another HTTPS URL -- which is entirely within your stated
desires to have "[one] commit ... per one thing [you've]i done" for
a patch where the Subject is literally "Replace HTTP links with HTTPS
ones", for which I suggested an improvement.

> But as it's the only one here, just forget this patch.

You seem hostile to accepting feedback on how this patch could be
improved. It's one thing to use automation to help generate patches,
and I understand your apparent desires to keep it automated, but that
is not always how patch development turns out.

Your instructions appear to take a long way to just say "here's a patch,
take it or leave it" which seems pretty anti-collaborative to me.
