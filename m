We could. But, without a refcount on the task pointer, that could be
tricky, even though we don't dereference it. In the same situation,
if the tsk owner dies and is freed and is reallocated to a new perf 
session task but with different PID, we could be mixing things up again
?

Special pid here could be -1.
