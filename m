Hi Jeffery,

Just wondering what the userspace/testing plans for this driver.

This introduces a new user facing API for a device without pointers to
users or tests for that API.

Although this isn't a graphics driver, and Greg will likely merge
anything to the kernel you throw at him, I do wonder how to validate
the uapi from a security perspective. It's always interesting when
someone wraps a DMA engine with user ioctls, and without enough
information to decide if the DMA engine is secure against userspace
misprogramming it.

Also if we don't understand the programming API on board the device,
we can't tell if the "core" on the device are able to reprogram the
device engines either.

Figuring this out is difficult at the best of times, it helps if there
is access to the complete device documentation or user space side
drivers in order to faciliate this.

The other area I mention is testing the uAPI, how do you envisage
regression testing and long term sustainability of the uAPI?

Thanks,
Dave.
