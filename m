I do not believe the issue I raised in 5.10 has made any progress.

If you look at the content in 5.11 we have actually regressed.

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fpga/3295710c-5e82-7b97-43de-99b9870a8c8c@redhat.com/

Over the last two releases, I have shown i have the time and interest to maintain this subsystem.

So I am asking for

And to use/maintain my fpga-next and fpga-testing as official kernel.org branches.
