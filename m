Yes.

I guess I was proposing a two dts-node / two drive approach here.

dts node #1:just covers the memory range for accessing the FEC-corrected data
driver #1: read-only and reads the FEC-corrected data

dts node #2: covers the memory range that's _not_ the FEC-corrected
memory range.
driver #2: read-write.  reading reads uncorrected data

Does that seem sane?

At least sdm845 is about the same.  I cross-referenced docs I had with
sc7180 and sdm845 and that's how I came up with my model for how this
works.
