Sorry! I should make the commit message more comprehensive.

This change just asks Intel IOMMU driver to use the default domain
specified by the generic default domain framework, just like what other
vendor iommu drivers do. I understand that some users wants to use DMA
domain for some specific devices when the default domain type is
identity, and vice versa, use identity domain for some devices while
default one is DMA. I think Sai's patch series posted at

https://www.spinics.net/lists/iommu/msg41680.html

is a good start. It changes the default domain with all device drivers
unbound in the generic layer, hence every vendor iommu driver could
benefit from it.

Best regards,
baolu
