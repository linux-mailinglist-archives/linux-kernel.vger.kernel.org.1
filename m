The point of that patch is it will make it safe to remove the numa_off because
any later accidental reference to a non existent node (i.e. one not defined
in SRAT) will not blow up.

It doesn't fix your original problem. What it does do, is fix the new problem case
you introduce by removing numa_off below.  It ensures you still return NUMA_NO_NODE
in cases which should do so (i.e. all of them if you have no SRAT and are using ACPI).

Of course, you could just not remove the numa_off = true bit then you won't hit
that condition anyway. There are plenty of other reasons for the SRAT patch though,
it just happens to close a problem you were introducing here as well.

For reference we had an AMD platform that had no SRAT, but provided _PXM for
a few nodes in its DSDT.   That result in non booting systems.  It only affected
x86 because ARM64 had that numa_off = true being set.  If we change the arm64 case
without the patch to ensure the underlying problem is fixed, you are very likely to hit
the equivalent problem. There may well be platforms out there relying on that quirk
of what the code currently does.

That looks like the correct approach to me as well.

No way to that one.  The only right return value from acpi_map_pxm_to_node
when no node is provided (always the case if you have no SRAT) is
NUMA_NO_NODE.  Do not paper over that - fix the caller to handle
a perfectly valid return value.
