Hi Laurentiu.

You are encouraged to commit your own code, it is anyway you who knows
the state of the code best. The golden rule is that the code must have
been seen by somone else before you merge, are translated there must be
an acked-by or reviewed-by on each of the patches.

If you look at ths page:

    https://people.freedesktop.org/~seanpaul/whomisc.html

You can see that a lot of people commit their own code in drm-misc.
Example:

    Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>, <daniel@ffwll.ch>
    (authored=159 committed=249 self_committed=153)

There is only a few patches written by Daniel that is committed by
someone else. And all patches committed by Daniel carries an
a-b or -rb by someone else.

If the challenge is only to push the patches to drm-misc-next there
is a lot of people that can help you. I would be happy to do so, but
would need a resend as I have deleted the patches from my inbox.

I could dig the pathces out somewhere else, but a fresh rebase would
be preferred.
