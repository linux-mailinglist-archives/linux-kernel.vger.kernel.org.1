For MTE it's trickier (probably similar to VHE) as we do the setup early
in proc.S before we hit the cpufeature infrastructure.

So far we haven't agreed on disabling MTE means - is it disabled
completely (no Normal Tagged memory type) or we just need to disable tag
checking? The former is required if we expect buggy hardware (SoC-level,
not necessarily CPU). The latter, at least for the kernel, is already
handled via the kasan.mode cmdline. For user, we can disable the tagged
address ABI via sysctl (or kernel cmdline) and it indirectly disabled
MTE since the C library detects this.
