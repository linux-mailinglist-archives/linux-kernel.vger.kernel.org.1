That is correct.  It is operating exactly as it should, if SRAT hasn't been parsed
and you are on ACPI platform there are no nodes.  They cannot be created at
some later date.  The dummy code doesn't change this. It just does enough to carry
on operating with no specified nodes.

Without the SRAT protection patch [1] you may well run into problems
because someone somewhere will have _PXM in a DSDT but will
have a non existent SRAT.   We had this happen on an AMD platform when we
tried to introduce working _PXM support for PCI. [2]

So whilst this seems superficially safe, I'd definitely be crossing your fingers.
Note, at that time I proposed putting the numa_off = false into the x86 code
path precisely to cut out that possibility (was rejected at the time, at least
partly because the clarifications to the ACPI spec were not pubilc.)

The patch in [1] should sort things out however by ensuring we only create
new domains where we should actually be doing so. However, in your case
it will return NUMA_NO_NODE anyway so this isn't the right way to fix things.
