Agreed, however AFAICT rt_time is only incremented by rq_clock_task()
deltas, which don't include IRQ time with IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING=y. That would
then be directly compared to the sysctl runtime.

Adding some prints in sched_rt_runtime_exceeded() and running this test
case on my Juno, I get:

  # IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING=y
  cpu=2 rt_time=713455220 runtime=950000000 rq->avg_irq.util_avg=265
  (rt_time oscillates between [70.1e7, 75.1e7]; avg_irq between [220, 270])

  # IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING=n
  cpu=2 rt_time=963035300 runtime=949951811
  (rt_time oscillates between [94.1e7, 96.1e7];

Throttling happens for IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING=n and doesn't for
IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING=y - clearly the accounted rt_time isn't high enough for
that to happen, and it does look like what is missing in rt_time (or what
should be subtracted from the available runtime) is there in the avg_irq.

Or is that another case where I shouldn't have been writing emails at this
hour?
