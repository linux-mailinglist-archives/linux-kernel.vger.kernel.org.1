Subject: [PATCH] mm/migrate: clear __GFP_RECLAIM for THP allocation for
 migration

In migration target allocation functions, THP allocations uses different
gfp_mask, especially, in regard to the reclaim gfp_mask. There is no
reason to use different reclaim gfp_mask for each cases and it is
an obstacle to make a common function in order to clean-up migration
target allocation functions. This patch fixes this situation by using
common reclaim gfp_mask for THP allocation.
