the easiest way to fake this is just to assign a different value than the one returned by Read Encryption Key Size on the acceptor side. No need to mess with LMP details.

If you add this change to both sides, what are the steps to reproduce this and what does btmon show? You might have to also enable dynamic_debug for l2cap.ko so that we see the function call trace.

I am a bit pedantic with this one, since it is critical to understand where the current changes to handle anything KNOB related have their shortcomings. I spent so much time testing every single corner case. Certainly I could have missed something, but if I really did, this time around I want to either simplify the code or properly comment it at least.

Please see the other email thread / patch from Archie trying to also add another encryption key size check.

Regards

Marcel
