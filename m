Why is that different than any other form of reclaim?

Should we do the same for global reclaim? Move reclaim to userspace
resume where there are no GFP_FS, GFP_NOWAIT etc. restrictions and
then have everybody just reclaim exactly what they asked for, and punt
interrupts / kthread allocations to a worker/kswapd?

Well you haven't made a good argument why memory.high is actually
different than any other form of reclaim, and why it should be the
only implementation of page reclaim that has special-cased handling
for the inherent "unfairness" or rather raciness of that operation.

You cut these lines from the quote:

  Under pressure, page reclaim can struggle to satisfy the reclaim
  goal and may return with less pages reclaimed than asked to.

  Under concurrency, a parallel allocation can invalidate the reclaim
  progress made by a thread.

Even if we *could* invest more into trying to avoid any unfairness,
you haven't made a point why we actually should do that here
specifically, yet not everywhere else.

(And people have tried to do it for global reclaim[1], but clearly
this isn't a meaningful problem in practice.)

I have a good reason why we shouldn't: because it's special casing
memory.high from other forms of reclaim, and that is a maintainability
problem. We've recently been discussing ways to make the memory.high
implementation stand out less, not make it stand out even more. There
is no solid reason it should be different from memory.max reclaim,
except that it should sleep instead of invoke OOM at the end. It's
already a mess we're trying to get on top of and straighten out, and
you're proposing to add more kinks that will make this work harder.

I have to admit, I'm baffled by this conversation. I consider this a
fairly obvious, idiomatic change, and I cannot relate to the
objections or counter-proposals in the slightest.
