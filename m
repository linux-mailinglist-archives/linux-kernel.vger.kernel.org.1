Ah ok, you are parking the CB kthread after the no-cb CB's are already
invoked (that's when parkme() is called -- i.e. after rcu_do_batch() in the
CB kthread runs).

Yeah, I don't see the purpose of acquiring rcu_barrier mutex either now. Once
you park, all CBs should have been invoked by the nocb CB thread right?
kthread_park() waits for the thread to be parked before proceeding. And you
don't de-offload before it is parked.

Which nocb kthread is competing? Do you mean GP or CB?

Either way, could you clarify how does softirqs compete? Until the thread is
parked, you wouldn't de-offload. And once you de-offload, only then the
softirq would be executing callbacks. So at any point of time, it is
either the CB kthread executing CBs or the softirq executing CBs, not both.
Or did I miss something?
