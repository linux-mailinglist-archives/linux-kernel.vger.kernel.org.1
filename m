Yes, I saw scripts/spatch, but that script is not what is installed in
/usr/local/bin.
(see more below)

OK, I did all of those.

Is this expected?

$ ./autogen

spatch is installed in /usr/local/bin/spatch:

$ ll /usr/local/bin/spatch
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 15547736 Jun 14 07:32 /usr/local/bin/spatch*

$ file /usr/local/bin/spatch

I still get this runtime error:

Python error: No module named coccilib.elems
