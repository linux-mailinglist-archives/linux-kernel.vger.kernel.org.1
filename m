This bisection is probably one of the most interesting ones
indeed.  I should mention it when I finally get round to making
a "KernelCI bisections hall of fame" blog post.

I think what you're doing is perfectly fine, there were some
issues with Jenkins and one build server that caused some
KernelCI builds to not be run this week.  Also there is an
intermittent bug in LAVA that causes tests to not run, so I think
the delay was due to an unfortunate combination of infrastructure
issues.

We now have a rather fast build server dedicated to bisections,
so for a maintainer branch like yours where it just takes a
handful of iterations I would expect this kind of report to be
sent at most 6h after a git push.  Bisecting linux-next can take
a few extra hours with typically 10~15 iterations.

Best wishes,
Guillaume
