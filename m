Not getting an irq_ack() here is expected, as the GIC uses the fast_eoi
flow, which doesn't use irq_ack() at all. If you really want irq_ack()
to be called, you'll need to change that flow for the specified
interrupts (handle_fasteoi_ack_irq is probably of interest).

Does it mean it asserts a level each time it gets an edge, and you need
to clear the MSI to allow another one? If so, that's a bit silly. it
would have made a lot more sense to leave it flowing to the GIC where
all the logic is already present.

If I'm correct above, I'd say there is a bit too much there! ;-)

Jazz is not dead. It just smells funny...
