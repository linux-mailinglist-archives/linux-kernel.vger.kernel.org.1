Excellent, thanks!

Just in case this isn't obvious to everyone, I want to point out, that
this patchset means the seccomp notifier can be (ab)used to receive exit
notifications for a task tree (given some caveats) sharing the same
filter. In any case, I'd rather have a proper thread management
implementation of this through pidfds in the future if there's a need
for this. But one can abuse seccomp to achieve something similar with
my change here.
(Technically, we could also expand the notifier to have a "listen" mode
 whereby it only notifies about e.g. filter installation and filter)
 orphanage.)
