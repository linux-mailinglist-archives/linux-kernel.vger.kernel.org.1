Hi,

I don't know what is the right thing to do here. I just want to
highlight that AOSP's audio (codec2) HAL depends on the ION system
heap and it will break AOSP for people who boot mainline on their
devices, even for just testing purpose like we do in Linaro. Right now
we need only 1 (Android specific out-of-tree) patch to boot AOSP with
mainline and Sumit is already trying to upstream that vma naming
patch. Removal of in-kernel ION, will just add more to that delta.

Regards,
Amit Pundir
