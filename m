This LMM marker is referenced quite often, but since it is a relaxed
cmpxchg(), its significance is not immediately clear. I was hoping to
add some hints as to why it is significant. The comment that it is
referring to is:

	/*
	 * Guarantee the tail ID is read before validating the
	 * recycled descriptor state. A read memory barrier is
	 * sufficient for this. This pairs with data_push_tail:C.
	 *
	 * Memory barrier involvement:

	 * If desc_reserve:C reads from desc_push_tail:B, then
	 * desc_reserve:F reads from desc_make_reusable:A.
	 *
	 * Relies on:
	 *
	 * MB from desc_make_reusable:A to desc_push_tail:B
	 *    matching
	 * RMB from desc_reserve:C to desc_reserve:F
	 *
	 * Note: desc_make_reusable:A, desc_push_tail:B, and
	 *       data_push_tail:C can all be different CPUs. However,
	 *       the desc_push_tail:B CPU must have previously seen
	 *       data_push_tail:D and the data_push_tail:D CPU (which
	 *       performs the full memory barrier) must have
	 *       previously seen desc_make_reusable:A.
	 */

English translation:

In order to push the data tail, a CPU must first see that the associated
descriptor is in the reusable state. Since a full memory barrier is
performed after that sighting and before doing the data tail push, _any_
CPU that sees the pushed data tail will be able to see that the
associated descriptor is in the reusable state.

In order to push the descriptor tail, a CPU must first see that the
associated data tail has been pushed. Therefore, that CPU would also see
that the associated descriptor is in the reusable state.

There needs to be a reason why the ordering of data tail pushing and
descriptor tail pushing is important.

How so? That memory barrier exists to make sure the reusable descriptor
state is stored before pushing the data tail. This is important for
readers (which start from the data tail) so they can notice if the
descriptor has since been invalidated (reusable state).

But where is it important that the data tail change is seen before the
descriptor tail change? How are the data tail and descriptor tail
significantly related to each other?
