For me thees 2 properties

	1. Run ASAP
	2. Finish the work un-interrupted

Scream the workers need to be SCHED_FIFO by default. CFS can't give you these
guarantees.

IMO using sched_set_fifo() for these workers is the right thing.

I'm not sure I agree with this. I think it's better to characterize tasks based
on their properties/requirements rather than what the rest of the userspace is
using.

I do appreciate that maybe some of these tasks have varying requirements during
their life time. e.g: they have RT property during specific critical section
but otherwise are CFS tasks. I think the UI thread in Android behaves like
that.

It's worth IMO trying that approach I pointed out earlier to see if making RT
try to pick an idle CPU rather than preempt CFS helps. Not sure if it'd be
accepted but IMHO it's a better direction to consider and discuss.

Or maybe you can wrap userspace pipeline critical section lock such that any
task holding it will automatically be promoted to SCHED_FIFO and then demoted
to CFS once it releases it.

Haven't worked with display pipelines before, so hopefully this makes sense :-)

Thanks
