Dear Sir,

I am Dr. Ismael Ismael (Former Finance Minister) of Arab Republic Of  
Syria, my aim and purpose for reaching you is purely due to the  
circumstances around me and the need for me to relocate my entire  
family to a different country where there is rule of law and freedom  
as my country is presently going through a phase that looks very  
uncertain for us hence i am contacting you base on a very confidential  
situation that i wish to seek your partnership for as i have taken my  
time to go through your profile and see you as a man with a great  
wealth of knowledge and wide understanding.

My aim for this contact is to seek your partnership with me for the  
fund i deposited last few years through confidential channels with a  
finance house in Europe. The fund is an amount of $70 million and it  
was deposited with a Finance house that is not owned by the government  
for security reasons.The sum of 25% of the total fund will go to you  
as your benefit from all the proceeds of the investment.

I am asking for your partnership to represent my interest in securing  
and investing the fund under your careful watch as my official  
position and close watch by our government makes it impossible for me  
to carry out my dealings in a open and direct manner hence i am  
seeking for a very reliable and trusted hand that can represent my  
interest in making sure the fund is moved to a more secured location  
and invested wisely.All the details concerning this proposal will be  
made available to you upon receiving your respose.I assure you of risk  
free transaction as I will provide you with all the required legal  
papers the finance house might require from you as the new new  
beneficiary and my representative.

please note that this is purely for your view only as it will not be  
proper to pass this information to anyone else for security reasons, i  
will want to hang on here for now and await for your timely response  
so as to enable me go into the details properly upon confirming your  
readiness to partner with me in this project.

Thanks
Regards
Dr. Ismael Ismael
Ex-Finance Minister (Syria)
