Lemme add Nick for clang for an opinion:

Nick, we're discussing what would be the cleanest and future-proof
way to disable stack protector for the function in the kernel which
generates the canary value as gcc10 ends up checking that value due to
tail-call optimizing the last function called by start_secondary()...
upthread are all the details.

And question is, can Jakub's suggestions above prevent tail-call
optimization on clang too and how reliable and future proof would that
be if we end up going that way?

Thx.
