Just curious: are device names like this really guaranteed to be
stable across versions?

Never looked at bootconfig.  Unfortunately it seems to require
initramfs so that pretty much means it's out for my usage.  :(

There are very few cases where a kernel command line parameter is the
only way to configure something.  Most of the time it's just there to
override a config.  I wouldn't suggest removing those.  I just don't
want a kernel command line parameter to be the primary way to enable
something.

It's better because it doesn't require keeping track and updating
these per-board (or per machine) arguments for each and every
board/machine you maintain.  If, for instance, we start out by
allowing HW video decoder to use non-strict.  So:

On one board, we add in "aa00000.video-codec" to the command line.
On some other board, maybe we add in "1d00000.video-codec" to the command line.
On some other board, maybe we add in "90400000.video-codec" to the command line.

Now we realize that there's some problem and we have to remove it, so
we need to go through and remove this from our command line
everywhere.  Worse is that we have to proactively notice it and remove
it.

Instead, let's imagine that we set a policy at a bit of a higher
level.  Different ideas:

a) We could have a CONFIG_ option for the video codec that's something
like "CONFIG_VIDEOCODEC_DEFAULT_NONSTRICT".  If this was set then if
there is no "iommu.strict" command line argument then this device
would be mapped as non-strict.  If "iommu.strict=0" or
"iommu.strict=1" is on the command line then it would override all of
these defaults.  Probably the existence (or maybe the default value)
of this CONFIG option implies that there are no known/expected
exploits related to it.

b) We could find some way to tag the video codec and then set
non-strictness on certain classes of devices, then we could have a
policy to disable strictness on certain classes of devices.

The nice thing about the above is that you could imagine someone
pushing a change to the stable trees that would fix everyone affected.
Nobody would need to go around and adjust command line options, they'd
just get the newest stable and it could cause devices to move into
strict mode if there was a known exploit.  I suppose with your
proposal stable trees could have a "blacklist" where the commandline
is ignored for exploited devices, but that seems ugly.

I'm not opposed to something existing that lets you override this on
the command line, but I'm just not a fan of it being the primary way.
