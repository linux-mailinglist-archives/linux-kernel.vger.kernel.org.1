In this case it uses kref_get() to increment the refcount. We could add
a kmemleak_add_trace() which allocates a new array and stores the stack
trace, linked to the original object. Similarly for kref_put().

If we do this for each inc/dec call, I'd leave it off as default and
only enable it explicitly by cmdline argument or
/sys/kerne/debug/kmemleak when needed. In most cases you'd hope there is
no leak, so no point in tracking additional metadata. But if you do hit
a problem, just enable the additional tracking to help with the
debugging.
