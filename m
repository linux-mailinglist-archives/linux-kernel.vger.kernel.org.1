It has been postulated that the pm_lock is bad for performance because
a CPU currently running rpmh_flush() could block other CPUs from
coming out of idle.  Similarly CPUs coming out of / going into idle
all need to contend with each other for the spinlock just to update
the variable tracking who's in PM.

Let's optimize this a bit.  Specifically:

- Use a count rather than a bitmask.  This is faster to access and
  also means we can use the atomic_inc_return() function to really
  detect who the last one to enter PM was.
- Accept that it's OK if we race and are doing the flush (because we
  think we're last) while another CPU is coming out of idle.  As long
  as we block that CPU if/when it tries to do an active-only transfer
  we're OK.

Changes in v5: None
Changes in v4:
- Rebased atop split-out fixes.

Changes in v3:
- Rebased atop patch to get rid of per-TCS lock.
- Removed bogus comment in rpmh_flush().
- thelock => the lock.
- Do one last double-check to try to avoid returning NOTIFY_BAD.

Changes in v2:
- Always grab drv->lock first to ensure lock ordering.
- Grab the cache_lock in rpmh_flush().
- Comments about why num_online_cpus() is OK.
- Return NOTIFY_DONE for things we don't care about.
- Use trylock to avoid spinning in CPU_PM code.
- !rpmh_flush() should have been rpmh_flush(), so we were alwys failing.
- Account for CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED not being called if we return NOTIFY_BAD.
