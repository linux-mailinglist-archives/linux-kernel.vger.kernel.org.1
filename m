Yes, I'm not sure that it's actually a problem in practice. And it may 
well be correct to change this in the generic code rather than try to 
work around it in Panfrost. But we shouldn't spam the user with warnings 
as that makes real issues harder to see.

Your suggestion to change the name seems reasonable to me, but I don't 
fully understand the opp code, so we'd need some review from the OPP 
maintainers. Hopefully Viresh, Nishanth or Stephen can provide some insight.
