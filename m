Reclaim can fail for any number of reasons, which is why we have retries 
sprinkled all over for it already. It doesn't seem hard to believe that it 
might just fail for transient reasons and drive us deeper into the hole as a 
result.

In this case, a.) the application is producing tons of dirty pages, and b.) we 
have really heavy systemwide I/O contention on the affected machines. This high 
load is one of the reasons that direct and kswapd reclaim cannot keep up, and 
thus nr_pages can become a number of orders of magnitude larger than 
SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX. This is trivially reproducible on these machines, it's not an 
edge case.

Putting a trace_printk("%d\n", __LINE__) at non-successful reclaim in 
shrink_page_list shows that what's happening is always (and I really mean 
always) the "dirty page and you're not kswapd" check, as expected:

	if (PageDirty(page)) {
		/*
		 * Only kswapd can writeback filesystem pages
		 * to avoid risk of stack overflow. But avoid
		 * injecting inefficient single-page IO into
		 * flusher writeback as much as possible: only
		 * write pages when we've encountered many
		 * dirty pages, and when we've already scanned
		 * the rest of the LRU for clean pages and see
		 * the same dirty pages again (PageReclaim).
		 */
		if (page_is_file_lru(page) &&
			(!current_is_kswapd() || !PageReclaim(page) ||
			!test_bit(PGDAT_DIRTY, &pgdat->flags))) {
			/*
			 * Immediately reclaim when written back.
			 * Similar in principal to deactivate_page()
			 * except we already have the page isolated
			 * and know it's dirty
			 */
			inc_node_page_state(page, NR_VMSCAN_IMMEDIATE);
			SetPageReclaim(page);

			goto activate_locked;
		}

As Johannes mentioned, the very intent of memory.high is to have it managed 
using a userspace OOM killer, which monitors PSI. As such, I'm not sure this 
distinction means much.
