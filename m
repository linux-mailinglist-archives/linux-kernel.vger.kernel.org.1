Thank you for your response.

The code was written by Kai-Heng Feng, whom I shall CC. The code is
part of the usbcore module, which does not have a maintainer listed in
MAINTAINERS, but the patch and most other recent patches to usbcore
were signed off exclusively by Greg Kroah-Hartman, so I guess that
makes him the de facto maintainer? I'll CC him as well.

I'm not sure whether it is easy to read the previous messages of this
thread if you got CC'ed just now, so I'll repeat/paraphrase the
important part of my initial mail for your convenience:
