In each case, we need to finalize the descriptor also in prb_commit()
when the descriptor is not longer the last reserved one.

It has to be done in two steps to avoid race:

prb_commit()

   + set PRB_COMMIT_MASK
   + check if it is still the last descriptor in the array
   + set PRB_FINAL_MASK when it is not the last descriptor

It should work because prb_reserve() finalizes the previous
descriptor after the new one is reserved. As a result:

   + prb_reserve() should either see PRB_COMMIT_MASK in the previous
     descriptor and be able to finalize it.

   + or prb_commit() will see that the head moved and it is not
     longer the last reserved one.

I keep my fingers crossed.

PS: I am still in the middle of review. And I had a feeling that
this situatuation was not handled.
