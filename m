No, that's the problem ... for a static kobject you can't free it; and
the release path may make assumption which aren't valid depending on
the kobject state.

My first thought was "what?  I got suckered into creating a patch",
thanks ;-)  But now I look, all the error paths do unwind back to the
initial state, so kfree() on error looks to be completely correct.  I
got confused by a bogus patch set like this:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20200528201353.14849-1-wu000273@umn.edu/

But it turns out the person sending the patch didn't understand the
network failure they quote:

b8eb718348b8 net-sysfs: Fix reference count leak in rx|netdev_queue_add_kobject

Has the problem precisely because the kobject is static.  The release
path clears it and that allows it to be readded.  I'll just reply to
the sender of the bogus patches.
