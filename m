Thanks Linus

i earlier went thr' KASAN series secretly & did learn a thing or two
from that!

'dd', i think, as you mentioned 'hackbench' i will use that as well.

Don't put too much expectation on me, this is more of a learning for
me. For user copy, the baby steps has been posted (To'ed you). On the
static kernel mapping on vmalloc front, i do not want to post the
patches in the current shape, though git-ized, will result in me
getting mercilessly thrashed in public :). Many of the other platforms
would fail and is not multi-platform friendly. i do not yet have a
public git branch, i can send you the (ugly) patches separately, just
let me know.

> I have several elder systems under my roof

i have only a few low RAM & CPU systems, so that is certainly helpful.

> so my contribution could hopefully be to help and debug any issues

If you would like, we can work together, at the same time keep in mind
that me spending time on it would be intermittent & erratic (though i
am trying to keep a consistent, but slow pace) perhaps making it
difficult to coordinate. Or else i will continue the same way & request
your help when required.

For the next 3 weeks, right now, i cannot say whether i would be able
to spend time on it, perhaps might be possible, but only during that
time i will know.

Regards
afzal
