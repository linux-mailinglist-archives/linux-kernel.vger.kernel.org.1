Indeed, I'd assume it's possible to leave the MMU off and just use CMA 
buffers instead, but wiring it up properly without the downstream 
mis-design should be pretty clean, so maybe that could ultimately be 
shared with 960 too (assuming the hardware isn't wildly dissimilar).

I notice there's already a whole load of MMU configuration hard-coded 
into the DRM driver - does iommu_info even need to be in the DT, or 
could that also be decided directly by the driver? (Most other MMU-aware 
DRM drivers seem to hard-code their drm_mm dimensions.) I can't imagine 
the *virtual* address space limits need to vary on a per-board basis, 
and they could easily be tied to the compatible if they legitimately 
differ across SoCs and a simple lowest-common-denominator approach 
wouldn't suffice for whatever reason.

Robin.
