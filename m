Subject: A must read for All Targeted Individuals: The Lieber Research 
Group at Harvard University

As a Targeted Individual, have you ever wondered why your government 
could read your mind/thoughts easily 24x7 and also make you hear 
menacing/threatening voices?

Rest assured you are not crazy. All these could be done using science 
and technology.

There is absolutely no need to have a brain surgery to have nanomaterial 
brain implants.

You can read more about the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University.

The Link: http://cml.harvard.edu/

The website of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University says:

"The Lieber group is focused broadly on science and technology at the 
nanoscale, harnessing the unique physical properties of novel 
nanomaterials to push scientific boundaries in biology and medicine.

We are focusing on a novel approach for integrating electronics within 
the brain and other areas of the nervous system, which involves 
non-invasive syringe delivery of neural network-like mesh electronics 
into targeted distinct brain regions. See Research page."

As you can see from the statements above, it is absolutely not necessary 
to have a brain surgery to have nanomaterial brain implaints. Your 
government is able to deliver neural network-like mesh electronics into 
targeted distinct brain regions using non-invasive syringe delivery.
