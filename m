The number of objects is quite hard, because it really complicates
bookkeeping and might also have an impact on performance, which is why
we prefer the statically allocated pool (like on x86, and we're trying
to get it for arm64 as well).

The sample interval is already tunable, just write to
/sys/module/kfence/parameters/sample_interval. Although we have this
(see core.c):

	module_param_named(sample_interval, kfence_sample_interval, ulong,
			   IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL) ? 0600 : 0400);

I was wondering if it should also be tweakable on non-debug kernels, but
I fear it might be abused. Sure, you need to be root to change it, but
maybe I'm being overly conservative here? If you don't see huge problems
with it we could just make it 0600 for all builds.

Indeed, which is why we also found it might be useful to tweak
sample_interval at runtime for debug-kernels. Although I don't know how
much luck you'll have hitting it again.

My strategy at that point would be to take the stack traces, try to
construct test-cases for those code paths, and run them through KASAN
(if it isn't immediately obvious what the problem is).

You can check /sys/kernel/debug/kfence/stats. On a system I just booted:

	[root@syzkaller][~]# cat /sys/kernel/debug/kfence/stats
	enabled: 1
	currently allocated: 18
	total allocations: 105
	total frees: 87
	total bugs: 0

The "currently allocated" count is the currently used KFENCE objects (of
255 for the default config).

Thank you!
