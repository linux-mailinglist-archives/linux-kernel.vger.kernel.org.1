Hello, I am Barrister Chris Tetteh Attorney to the late Engr. Steve Moore who died with his wife and their three kids in a car accident. Before his death he  had funds valued at twenty seven Million dollars deposited in a bank. I need your assistance to retrieve the money left behind by my client. Get back to me for more details. Thanks Barrister Chris Tetteh
