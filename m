Hi,

After installing Linux 5.8-rc6, it seems cryptsetup can no longer
open LUKS volumes.  Regardless of the entered passphrase (correct
or otherwise), the result is a very unhelpful "Keyslot open failed."
message.

On the kernels which fail, I also noticed that the cryptsetup
benchmark command appears to not be able to determine that any
ciphers are available (output at end of message), possibly for
the same reason.

Bisected to the following commit, which suggests a problem specific
to compat userspace (this is amd64 kernel).  I tested both ia32 and
x32 userspace to confirm the problem.  Reverting this commit on top
of 5.8-rc6 resolves the issue.

Looking at strace output the failing syscall appears to be:

  sendmsg(8, {msg_name=NULL, msg_namelen=0, 
	     msg_iov=[{iov_base=..., iov_len=512}], msg_iovlen=1,
	     msg_control=[{cmsg_len=16, cmsg_level=SOL_ALG,
	     cmsg_type=0x3}, {cmsg_len=32, cmsg_level=SOL_ALG,
	     cmsg_type=0x2}], msg_controllen=48, msg_flags=0}, 0)
	     = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)

where fd 8 is the descriptor received after "accept" from the AF_ALG
socket bound to the skcipher algorithm.

  547ce4cfb34cdecfa0ee19c29a5510329a7ac802 is the first bad commit

      switch cmsghdr_from_user_compat_to_kern() to copy_from_user()

      no point getting compat_cmsghdr field-by-field
