We build modules with the large code model, and always have AFAIK:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/powerpc/Makefile?commit=4fa640dc52302b5e62b01b05c755b055549633ae#n129

  # -mcmodel=medium breaks modules because it uses 32bit offsets from
  # the TOC pointer to create pointers where possible. Pointers into the
  # percpu data area are created by this method.
  #
  # The kernel module loader relocates the percpu data section from the
  # original location (starting with 0xd...) to somewhere in the base
  # kernel percpu data space (starting with 0xc...). We need a full
  # 64bit relocation for this to work, hence -mcmodel=large.
  KBUILD_CFLAGS_MODULE += -mcmodel=large


We also insert trampolines for branches, but IIUC that's a separate
issue.

cheers
