Does this look okay and sufficient ?

+Quantifying Migration
+=====================
+Following events can be used to quantify page migration.
+
+- PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS
+- PGMIGRATE_FAIL
+- THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS
+- THP_MIGRATION_FAILURE
+
+THP_MIGRATION_FAILURE in particular represents an event when a THP could not be
+migrated as a single entity following an allocation failure and ended up getting
+split into constituent normal pages before being retried. This event, along with
+PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS and PGMIGRATE_FAIL will help in quantifying and analyzing THP
+migration events including both success and failure cases.
