Good to see more msm8974 support upstream!

Regarding the second patch, that should only be needed in order to
use the GPU on these devices. I hope that patch won't be needed once
IOMMU support is added, which is the last major missing piece in order
to have the GPU working upstream. I posted a RFC patch [3] in January
but didn't get any suggestions. I suspect some kind of memory corruption
since the board gets unstable with that patch.

If that hack patch is still needed to use the GPU once IOMMU support is
in place, then I planned to troubleshoot it further by adding some log
statements to various probe functions with and without that patch to see
the probe order between the various subsystems. I suspect the issue is
that a clock isn't ticking yet.
