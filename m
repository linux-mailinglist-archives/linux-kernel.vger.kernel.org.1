Thanks.  You too ;)

I fail to understand what this patchset has to do with that
one-element-array issue :(

Could you please send along a reworked [0/n] cover letter?  Explain in
your own words, without requiring that readers go off and read web
pages

- What problem the patchset solves
- How it solves it
- The value of the patchset (to kernel developers or to end-users) so that we
  can understand why it should be merged.

Thanks.
