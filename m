I moved the above mentioned functions to drivers/of/fdt.c => it works.

But I am not sure if "drivers/of" is the right place - this driver is 
handling data from firmware and building FDT. I do not see any kexec 
related operations being handled by this driver in the current 
implementation.

Also, being a driver can it be loaded/unloaded on-demand? If yes, it may 
not be available when "ima kexec" calls are needed.

@Rob Herring - what do you think?

thanks,
