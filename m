The recommendation in such scenarios is to use multiple channel.

The bottle neck may not be in the remote. It may be mailbox serialising
the requests even when it can parallelise.

This is unacceptable delay for schedutil fast_switch. So no for this one.

In general, this hides issues in the remote. We are trying to move towards
tops 1ms for a request and with MBOX_QUEUE at 20, I see 20ms is more that
big enough. We have it set to 30ms now. 500ms is way too large and not
required IMO.
