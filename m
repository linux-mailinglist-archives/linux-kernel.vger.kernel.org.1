Thanks for the tool and explanation. I will test the v3 with this one.

I didn't count them but there was more than 2000lines, probability to miss
a frequency is really low. Also changing from 500MHz to 1.8GHz could have
trigger some out-of-spec issue.

But just to be sure I will add an init phase before doing random stuff.

No I don't, see my answer on patch 4/7.

Thanks for your review,
