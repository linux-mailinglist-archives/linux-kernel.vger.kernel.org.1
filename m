This does not make much sense to me. KERN_NO_CONSOLES would be another
global flag. If you enable/disable its functionality, it would affect
all strings with this flag (not only the ones used by OOM killer).

I am not going to comment the rest. We are going in circles and I do
not know how to better explain my concerns.

One problem there is a lack of reviewers.
