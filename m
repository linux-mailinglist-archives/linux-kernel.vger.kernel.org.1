I can give this a try; for the context, I copied uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h
without thinking too much, and that does:

  #ifndef __SYSCALL
  #define __SYSCALL(x, y)
  #endif

That's better indeed, I think that's a remnant of when I was listing a lot
of things that could be shared.

I remember exploring a few different options there, but it's been a while
already. I think one of the reasons I kept some form of explicit assignment
is to avoid making reading

  /proc/sys/kernel/sched_domain/cpu*/domain*/flags

more convoluted than it is now (i.e. you have to go fetch the
bit -> name translation in the source code).

In the grand scheme of things I'd actually like to have this file output
the names of the flags rather than their values (since I now save them when
SCHED_DEBUG=y), but I didn't find a simple way to hack the existing SD ctl
table (sd_alloc_ctl_domain_table() and co) into doing this.


Now as to making this fully automagic, I *think* I could do something like
having a first enum to set up an ordering:

  #define SD_FLAG(name, ...) __##name,
  enum {
    #include <linux/sched/sd_flags.h>
  };

A second one to have powers of 2:

  #define SD_FLAG(name, ...) name = 1 << __##name,
  enum {
    #include <linux/sched/sd_flags.h>
  };

And finally the metadata array assignment might be doable with:

  #define SD_FLAG(_name, mflags) [__##_name] = { .meta_flags = mflags, .name = #_name },

Or, if there is a way somehow to directly get powers of 2 out of an enum:

  #define SD_FLAG(_name, mflags) [_ffs(_name)] = { .meta_flags = mflags, .name = #_name },
