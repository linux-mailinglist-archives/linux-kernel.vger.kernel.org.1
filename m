Correct, the rpmsg_char control device must be associated with a
transport instance, e.g. a virtio rpmsg instance sitting on a
remoteproc. This is necessary in order to be able to tie the dynamically
created rpmsg_char endpoints (i.e. the thing that is similar to your tty
devices) to a particular transport/remoteproc..

The reason why qcom_smd needs to be involved is because of the problem
that I want the control device to appear without depending on particular
channels being exposed by the firmware.

My proposal/wish is that 1) rpmsg_char is implemented for virtio/rpmsg,
so that the control device is registered as virtio rpmsg is initiated
and 2) that rpmsg_char is extended to allow creating tty devices in
addition to the existing interface (if the existing read/write interface
isn't enough).

And that's not possible using the two-stage approach rpmsg_char takes,
instead I use udev rules to invoke the ioctl on the control device.

The benefit is that the design of the firmware is not tied to the design
of the Linux system.

What do you mean with this? Are you saying that running tty over rpmsg
over SPI is a bad idea?

I do think it's a good idea to decouple the system design on the Linux
side from the naming of channels provided by the firmware.
