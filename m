Hi Daniel

Your patch looks promising, however I have few concerns.

In OS-MLE table there is a buffer for TPM event log, however I see that
you are not using it, but instead allocate space somewhere in the
memory. I am just wondering if, from security perspective, it will be
better to use memory from TXT heap for event log, like we do in TBOOT.

There is a function that verifies if platform is TXT capable
-grub_txt_verify_platform(), it only checks SMX and GETSEC features.
Although BIOS should enforce both VMX and VT-d enabled when enabling
TXT, I think that adding these check here as redundancy may be a good
idea. The same situation is with TPM presence.

I suggest to add possibility to skip TXT launch when last boot ended
with TXT error. This option can avoid boot loops when something goes
wrong.

How will you read LCP from storage? I see that there is slaunch_module
command that currently you are using only for loading SINIT. In the
future it can be expanded to support LCP file too, what do you think?

Do not forget to apply changes required by latest Intel's platforms, you
should check following commits in TBOOT's repository: 2f03b57ffdba,
fe2dddd742dc.
