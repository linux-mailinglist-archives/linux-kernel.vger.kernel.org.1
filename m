That's correct.

I remember Rusty adding that code, but I don't know if we ever
considered enabling CPUMASK_OFFSTACK.

Probably we meant to but never got around to doing it.

Right.

Agreed, just clarify in the change log that it's not freed at the moment
because of CPU_MASK_OFFSTACK=n

I don't think so, cpumask_t is semi-deprecated AIUI.

Our current defconfigs have NR_CPUS=2048, which is probably just small
enough to continue using OFFSTACK=n.

But we allow configuring NR_CPUS up to 8192, which surely would need
OFFSTACK=y in order to work.

So I think we need to stick with cpumask_var_t, but we should test with
OFFSTACK=y, and should probably be a bit more careful with checking the
allocations succeed.

And then we should select OFFSTACK=y for NR_CPUS above some threshold.

cheers
