Hi,

I work on an emulator for the Nintendo Switch that uses a similar technique=
,
in our testing it works very well and is much more performant than even
PTRACE_SYSEMU.

To work around DRM reading the memory contents I think mprotect could
be used, after patching the syscall a copy of the original code could be
kept somewhere in memory and the patched region mapped --X.
With this, any time the DRM attempts to read to the patched region and
perform integrity checks it will cause a segfault and a branch to the
signal handler. This handler can then return the contents of the original,
unpatched region to satisfy them checks.

Are memory contents checked by DRM solutions too often for this to be
performant?
