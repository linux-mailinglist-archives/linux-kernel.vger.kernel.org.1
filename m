Hi Saravana,

Sorry for the delay replying.

This makes more sense, thanks.

One thing though: this seems to be exclusively DT driven. Have you
looked into how that would look like for other firmware types such as
ACPI?

Another thing is the handling of dependencies. Statically built
irqchips are initialized in the right order based on the topology
described in DT, and are initialized early enough that client devices
will find their irqchip This doesn't work here, obviously. How do you
propose we handle these dependencies, both between irqchip drivers and
client drivers?

Thanks,

	M.
