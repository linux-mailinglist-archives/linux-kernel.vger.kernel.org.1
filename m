Btw, I did have one reaction that I can't find in the original thread,
which probably means that it got lost.

If one of the designed uses for this is for dropping file descriptors
just before execve(), it's possible that we'd want to have the option
to say "unshare my fd array" as part of close_range().

Yes, yes, you can do

        unshare(CLONE_FILES);
        close_range(3,~0u);

to do it as two operations (and you had that as the example typical
use), but it would actually be better to be able to do

        close_range(3, ~0ul, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE);

instead. Because otherwise we just waste time copying the file
descriptors first in the unshare, and then closing them after.. Double
the work..

And maybe this _did_ get mentioned last time, and I just don't find
it. I also don't see anything like that in the patches, although the
flags argument is there.
