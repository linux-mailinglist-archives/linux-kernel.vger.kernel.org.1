repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both families.

FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ($5,500,000) immediately to your bank
account, this funds belong to late consumer of our bank; From Syria
Nationality. who died along with his entire family from the ongoing
war/crisis in Syria, This is a very highly secret; i will like you to
please keep this proposal as a top secret or delete it if you are not
interested, upon receipt of your reply, i will send to you more
details about this business deal.

I don=E2=80=99t want the fund to go into the bank treasury and some bank
directors/government executives will take the fund as unclaimed fund
and use it for selfish and worthless ventures, and as such, lets claim
the fund now; I am inviting you for a business deal where this money
can be shared between us in the ratio of 40% for me/40% for you and
20% will go for charity purposes, to help some less privileged in our
society If you agree to handle this business with me. Further details
of the transfer will be forwarded to you as soon as I receive your
return mail.
