OK, based on failing to really grasp the M4U and LARB side of MTK's 
interconnect for the media stuff, I'm not even going to ask about that 
MPU ;)

What I had in mind and didn't do a good job of actually expressing there 
was that this is a strong justification for using shared code as much as 
possible, to minimise the amount we have to maintain that's specific to 
this relatively niche use-case (it's good for SoCs like yours that *can* 
support it, but most will either have IOMMUs or simply not have the 
option of doing anything).

There are probably more recent resources, but what I could easily turn 
up from memory (other than a lot of back-and-forth about virtio) is this 
old patchset which seems to form a reasonable overview:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20180824162535.22798-1-bauerman@linux.ibm.com/

The main differences are that they have the luxury of being able to make 
the SWIOTLB buffer accessible in-place, rather than having to control 
its initial allocation, and because it's a system-wide thing they could 
pretty much achieve it all with existing machinery - on second look 
there are actually far fewer changes there than I thought - whereas you 
need the extra work to handle it on a per-device basis.
