No, I already assumed you had backed that out: these are fixes beyond that.

Indeed, more explanation needed: coming.

Sigh. I wish you had waited for me to send you fixes, or waited for an
identifiable tag like 5.8-rc1.  Andrew has been very hard at work with
mm patches to Linus, but it looks like there are still "data_race" mods
to come before -rc1, which may stop your v12 from applying cleanly.

Races, yes. Look, I'll send you now patches 1 and 2: at least with those
in it should be safe for you and others to test compaction (if 5.8-rc1
turns out well: I think so much has gone in that it might have unrelated
problems, and often the -rc2 is much more stable).

But no point in sending 3 and 4 at this point, since ...

=2E.. shows that your locking primitives are not yet good enough
to handle the case when tasks are moved between memcgs with
move_charge_at_immigrate set.  "bin/cg m" in the tests I sent,
but today I'm changing its "seconds=3D60" to "seconds=3D1" in hope
of speeding up the reproduction.

Ah, good, two machines crashed in 1.5 hours: but I don't need to
examine the crashes, now that it's obvious there's no protection -
please, think about rotate_reclaimable_page() (there will be more
cases, but in practice that seems easiest to hit, so focus on that)
and how it is not protected from mem_cgroup_move_account().

I'm thinking too. Maybe judicious use of lock_page_memcg() can fix it
(8 years ago it was unsuitable, but a lot has changed for the better
since then); otherwise it's back to what I've been doing all along,
taking the likely lruvec lock, and checking under that lock whether
we have the right lock (as your lruvec_memcg_debug() does), retrying
if not. Which may be more efficient than involving lock_page_memcg().

But I guess still worth sending my first two patches, since most of us
use move_charge_at_immigrate only for... testing move_charge_at_immigrate.
Whereas compaction bugs can hit any of us at any time.

I got one of those quite quickly too after setting "cg m"'s seconds=3D1.
I think the best thing I can do while thinking and researching, is
give 5.7-rc7-mm1 a run on that machine with the speeded up moving,
to see whether or not that refcount bug reproduces.

Good, thanks.
