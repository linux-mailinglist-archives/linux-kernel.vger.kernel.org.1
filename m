But IMHO the

"* however, the PELT windows are not aligned between grq and gse."

should only apply to update_tg_cfs_util() and update_tg_cfs_runnable().
And attach_entity_load_avg() (for cfs_rq and se).

They seem to be special since we derive divider from a cfs_rq PELT value
and use it for a se PELT value.

I assume this fact is specifically worth highlighting with a comment. I
mean the fact we can do this because the decay windows are actually aligned.
