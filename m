Robin has a point - user space is long gone at this time.  As such the first 
question to ask is what kind of CS session was running at the time the system
was shutting down.  Was it a perf session of a sysfs session?

I'm guessing it was a sysfs session because user space has been blown away a
while back and part of that process should have killed all perf sessions.

If I am correct then simply switching off the ETR HW in the shutdown() amba bus
callback should be fine - otherwise Mike's approach is mandatory.  There is 
also the exchange between Robin and Sai about removing the SMMU shutdown
callback, but that thread is still incomplete. 

Thanks,
Mathieu
