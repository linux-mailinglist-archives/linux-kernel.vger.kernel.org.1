Right, but today the limitation with our implementation is the support of
additional shared buffers(big data). The possibility to add a single DMA pool
would help to solve this issue. Furthermore we have a DT generator tools that
should support the shared memory regions tuning. Having an unique shared memory
region could simplify this tool usage.
For these reasons i would be interested in finding a more scalable solution.

ok, in this case the fix would be your V1 patch and the question is do we take
the opportunity to implement something more scalable as existing is already broken?
or only first fix the issue with the associated limitations?

yes probably.

Here i was speaking about you V2 implementation. As consequence i would
implement a function in the stm32_rproc platform that would set the vdevbuf_mem_id,
depending on a default memory region name, i would define in stm32 bindings.
