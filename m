Again beware of the fact that this is vendor SiP FID space of SMCCC.
Standardising that informally inside the Linux kernel is already bit
risky and challenging. I don't want to complicate it with above
splitting of address way.

Yes, thanks for the catch. Not sure if it was intentional, Peng ?
Even if it was I would like to fix as it is unnecessary to read response
from shmem which may have garbage or the input itself when the command
returns error.

I am not entirely sure about this. I see this base address here as a
unique identifier referred in the SCMI specification(5.1.3.1 Doorbell):

"If the doorbell is SMC or HVC based, it should follow the SMC Calling
Convention [SMCCC]. The doorbell needs to provide the identifier of
the Shared Memory area that contains the payload. The Shared Memory area
containing the payload is updated with the SCMI return response when the
call returns. The identifier of the Shared Memory area should be 32-bits
and each identifier should map to a distinct Shared Memory area."

Sorry I seem to have missed the 32-bit part here when I said yes for
using address as the identifier. I wasn't explicit before when I said
I was OK for the address as 2nd parameter.

Now I recall that I was thinking about additional/optional property from
DT for this identifier, absence of which will be passing 0 as the id.

I agree with you too along with Florian's idea but I don't want to
rely on that in the kernel.

My main worry is the 32-bit identifier as specified in the spec now. I
had missed that aspect in the spec when I agreed to use the address.

Yes I am fine with the idea of adding identifier for distinguishing the
shmem if there are multiple channels. I haven't brought the idea of
changing that address w/o modifying TFA/firmware as IMO it is not that
simple. Florian has covered the reasons for the same already.
