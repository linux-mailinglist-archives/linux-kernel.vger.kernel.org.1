Just ran into this issue again, with what I think may be most compelling
example yet why this is problematic:

The tracee incurred a signal, we PTRACE_SYSEMU'd to the rt_sigreturn,
which the tracer tried to emulate by applying the state from the signal frame.
However, the PTRACE_SYSEMU stop is a syscall-stop, so the tracer's write
to x7 was ignored and x7 retained the value it had in the signal handler,
which broke the tracee.
