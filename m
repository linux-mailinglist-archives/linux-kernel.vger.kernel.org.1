Even before earlycon?  Ick.  For me earlycon comes up way before
pinctrl and I thought that, by design, earlycon came up so dang early
that you could debug almost anything with it.

To confirm, I could even drop into earlycon_kgdb (which starts later
than earlycon), then set a breakpoint on msm_pinctrl_probe() and I'd
hit my breakpoint.  Enabling earlycon should be super easy these
days--just add the "earlycon" command line parameter and the kernel
seems to do the rest of the magic based on the "stdout-path".  I guess
if your bootloader doesn't cooperate and leave the system in an OK
state then you'll be in bad shape, but otherwise it should be nice...

NOTE: if you have earlycon and this is still causing crashes before
earlycon starts, the only things I can think of are side effects of
this patch.  Could it have made your kernel just a little too big and
now you're overflowing some hard limit of the bootloader?  Maybe
you're hitting a ccache bug and using some stale garbage (don't laugh,
this happened to me the other year)?  Maybe there's a pointer bug and
this moves addresses just enough to make it cause havoc?

So on SDM845 we aren't setting "wakeirq_dual_edge_errata", right?
It's possible that you also need it, but I didn't have an SDM845
device in front of me to test with--I only have remote access to one.
...but in any case, the fact that SDM845 doesn't have
"wakeirq_dual_edge_errata" set should eliminate a bunch of code.

Once you eliminate that there's almost nothing left of this patch.
You could try commenting out:

irq_set_handler_locked(d, handle_fasteoi_irq);

...and see if that helps?

NOTE: I just tried putting kernel 5.8 on my sdm845-cheza device.  It
booted up without crashing...  I'm probably not using the same config
you are, but at least it appears that sdm845 isn't totally broken or
anything...
