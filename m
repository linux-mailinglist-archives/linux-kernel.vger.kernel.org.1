Yeah I thought of that as the easiest fix, but it might be safer to
explicitly zero-init in efi_main to avoid future problems in case
someone adds another variable in bss and isn't aware of this obscure
requirement. We actually already have sys_table in bss, but that one is
always initialized. There's also other globals that aren't annotated
(but not in bss by virtue of having initializers). What do you think?

What do you think of the other problem -- that's actually worse to fix,
as it won't just be when kaslr is disabled, the startup_64 code will do
relocation to the end of init_size and clobber the initrd before getting
to the kaslr code, so it will break as soon as the firmware loads the
"unified kernel image" at a 2Mb-aligned address. The only thing I can
think of is to just unconditionally call efi_relocate_kernel if we were
entered via handover_entry?
