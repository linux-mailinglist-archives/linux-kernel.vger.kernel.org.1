Humm, I think the original intent of that code was to cache the results
of find_all_arm_spe_pmus(), as the variable it is assigned to is static.

So not a leak, as there was that static reference to it to reuse it
later, but that is strange in a function named "__init()" which usually
is called only once, anyway, so I think that the paragraph with
"Firstly" is kinda ok, but confusing, I think it should read:

- auxtrace_record__init() is called only once, so there is no point in
  using a static variable to cache the results of
  find_all_arm_spe_pmus(), make it local and free the results after use.

The second paragraph is SPE specific, so I'm not qualified to judge on
it.

I'm replacing the first paragraph with the version I wrote and keep it
in my local branch, please holler if you think I misunderstood.
