While possible, it sounds quite heavy weight to me. Page allocator would
have to somehow maintain those pre-zeroed pages. This pool will also
become a very scarce resource very soon because everybody just want to
run faster. So this would open many more interesting questions.

A global knob with all or nothing sounds like an easier to use and
maintain solution to me.

Agreed. That would be an interesting option.

We can probably allow MADV_FREE on shmem but that would require an
exclusively mapped page. Shared case is really tricky because of silent
data corruption in uncoordinated userspace.
