This does sound sensible; I can shuffle this around for v5.

FWIW the reason I had this very patch before the instrumentation is that
IMO it really wants to be propagated and could thus directly be tagged with
SDF_SHARED_PARENT when the instrumentation hits. It's a minor thing, but
having it after the instrumentation means that I'll first have to tag it
without any hierarchical metaflag, and then tag it with SDF_SHARED_PARENT
in the propagation fix.

If that sounds fine by you, I'll do just that.
