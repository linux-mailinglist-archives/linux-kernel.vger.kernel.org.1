Let me understand the problem better:

- We do not want __tsan_func_entry/exit (looking at the disassembly,
these aren't always generated).
- We do not want kcsan_disable/enable calls (with the new __READ_ONCE version).
- We do *not* want the call to __read_once_word_nocheck if we have
__no_sanitize_or_inline. AFAIK that's the main problem -- this applies
to both KASAN and KCSAN.

From what I gather, we want to just compile the function as if the
sanitizer was never enabled. One reason for why this doesn't quite
work is because of the preprocessor.

Note that the sanitizers won't complain about these accesses, which
unfortunately is all these attributes ever were documented to do. So
the attributes aren't completely useless. Why doesn't
K[AC]SAN_SANITIZE := n work?
