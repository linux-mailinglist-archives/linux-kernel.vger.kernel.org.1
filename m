OK, I see the original code iterated over PCI devices finding anything
that matches the IDs in the table.

This may be problematic if there is driver bound to the device and
accessing the hardware simultaneusly. Although this is just read side
and I don't think these registers have any side effects when you read
them, so should not be an issue.

Yes, something like that.

I would like to keep it (the label) there but I think we can label
SPI_INTEL_SPI with that instead and then make the -pci.c to work
standalone if CONFIG_SPI_INTEL_SPI is not enabled.

config SPI_INTEL_SPI
        tristate "Intel PCH/PCU SPI flash core driver (DANGEROUS)"
	depends on SPI_INTEL_SPI_PCI || SPI_INTEL_SPI_PLATFORM
	...

config SPI_INTEL_SPI_PCI
        tristate "Intel PCH/PCU SPI flash PCI driver"
	depends on PCI
	...

Then distros could enable only CONFIG_SPI_INTEL_SPI_PCI which would only
expose the security bits. Of course I'm open to any other ideas :)
