The SystemTap team announces release 4.3

Enhancements to this release include: Userspace probes may be targeted
by buildid as an alternate to a path name, script functions may use
probe $context variables, stapbpf improvements including try-catch
statements, and error probes.

= Where to get it

  https://sourceware.org/systemtap/ - our project page
  https://sourceware.org/systemtap/ftp/releases/
  https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=615
  git tag release-4.3 (commit c9c23c987d)

  There have been over 120.31415 commits since the last release.
  There have been 27+ bugs fixed / features added since the last release.

= SystemTap frontend (stap) changes

- The target of process probes may be specified by hexadecimal buildid
  as an alternative to a path name.  This makes it possible to probe a
  variety of versions or aliases of a program, even if they are
  running inside containers under a different path name.  Works best
  with a debuginfod server that publishes the executables / debuginfo.
  The following probes glibc.so 2.32-2.fc32.x86_64 from fedora running
  anywhere on your machine.
  # export DEBUGINFOD_URLS=https://debuginfod.elfutils.org/
  # stap -e 'probe process("7ca24d4dc3de9d62d9ad6bb25e5b70a3e57a342f")
                   .function("*system") { log("hi") }'

- Functions can now be context-sensitive, meaning that they may make
  references to $context variables and similar constructs that could
  formerly appear only inside probe handlers.  This is implemented by
  cloning such functions for each probe.  
  Only some probe point (dwarf-based user & kernel) types are supported.
  function foo () { println ($$vars) }
  probe kernel.function("do_exit") { foo() }
  probe process("/bin/ls").function("main") { foo() }
  probe process("/lib*/libc.so.6").mark("*") { foo() }

- The process(EXE).begin probe handlers are now always triggered for
  already-running target processes.

= SystemTap backend changes

- Almost all of the kmalloc() allocations exceeding 4KB have been
  replaced by vmalloc(). This helps stap's kernel runtime work
  properly on systems with serious fragmentation in physical memory
  address space.

- More $variable resolution errors may be generated, especially for
  @var("") constructs that target global variables.  These are
  duplicate-eliminated by default, but may be seen with verbosity>=2.

- The stapbpf backend now supports try-catch statements, an improved
  error tapset, and error probes.

- The "Build-id mismatch" condition now becomes a warning, so while
  related probes are not inserted, the rest of the script may run.

= SystemTap tapset changes

- Added a new tapset function dump_stack() which prints the current
  kernel backtrace to the kernel trace buffer (as a thin wrapper
  around the kernel C API function dump_stack).

- The proc_mem_rss() tapset function now includes the resident shared
  memory pages as expected. The old behavior can be restored by the
  --compatible=4.2 option on the command line.

- Modules compiled with guru mode for a particular kernel version can
  now only be loaded on kernels with exactly matching version
  (vermagic string) instead of any kernel whose API matches according
  to the modversions mechanism. Use -B CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y to restore
  the prior behaviour.

= SystemTap sample scripts

- All 180+ examples can be found at https://sourceware.org/systemtap/examples/

- New sample scripts:
  security-band-aids/cve-2018-1000001.stp        
  security-band-aids/cve-2018-6485
  Historical emergency security band-aid scripts for example purposes only

= Examples of tested kernel versions 

2.6.32 (RHEL6 x86_64)
3.10.0 (RHEL7 x86_64)
4.15.0 (Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64)
4.18.0 (RHEL8 x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le, s390x)
5.3.8  (Fedora 30 i686)
5.3.9  (Fedora 31 x86_64)
5.4.0  (Fedora 32 x86_64)
5.7.0  (Fedora 33 x86_64) 

= Known issues with this release

- A change to syscall wrappers has resulted in the loss of the ability
  to modify syscall parameters.  (PR26015)

- An sdt probe cannot parse a parameter that uses a segment register.
  (PR13429)

- The presence of a line such as
      *CFLAGS += $(call cc-option, -fno-var-tracking-assignments)
  in the linux kernel Makefile unnecessarily reduces debuginfo quality,
  consider removing that line if you build kernels.
