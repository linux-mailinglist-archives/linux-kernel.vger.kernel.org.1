The legacy_cursor_update is really the thing that motivated the async
commit support in the first place.  Sadly we still have userspace that
expects to be able to use legacy cursor API, and that it will be
nonblocking (and not cause fps drop).  (I'm not a fan of the legacy
cursor UAPI.. don't hate the player..)

The premise is to do everything in terms of crtc_mask, although yeah,
it looks like there are a few points that need to look at things like
crtc->state->active.  The only point in msm-atomic itself that does
this is vblank_get/put(), possibly we can fix drm_vblank instead and
drop that workaround (see 43906812eaab06423f56af5cca9a9fcdbb4ac454)

The rest of the async part is really just supposed to be writing the
appropriate flush reg(s) and waiting until flush completes, although
dpu's excess layering makes this harder than it needs to be.

In practice, the kms->wait_flush() at the top of
msm_atomic_commit_tail() will block until a pending async commit
completes (this is where we hit the fps drop if we miss vblank
deadline), so I don't *think* you can trigger a use-after-free.  But
the dpu code could be better cleaned up to have less obj->state
dereference in the kms->flush_commit(crtc_mask)/etc path.
