I personally am not a fan of adding a path for PCI device either,
since PCI/IOMMU cores could have taken care of it while the same
path can't be used for other buses.

If we can't come to an agreement on globalizing mc pointer, would
it be possible to pass tegra_mc_driver through tegra_smmu_probe()
so we can continue to use driver_find_device_by_fwnode() as v1?
