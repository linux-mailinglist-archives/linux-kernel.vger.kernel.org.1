I mentioned my use case for this in the commit message and why it works
much better than printk() for that, please let me know if it is unclear:

 When debugging device drivers, I've found it very useful to be able to
 redirect existing pr_debug()/dev_dbg() prints to the trace buffer
 instead of dmesg.  Among the many advantages of the trace buffer is that
 it can be dynamically resized, allows these prints to combined with
 other trace events, and doesn't fill up system logs.

This is my only use case for this, and I've used it very very often
during the years I've been carrying this patch locally.
