I think the commit message should describe all the changes made in the 
patch, is it?

It did work before.

Before this change, firmware only checks if the received flag value is 
zero. If the value is zero, it preforms full reconfiguration. Otherwise 
it does partial reconfiguration.

To support bitstream authentication feature, firmware is updated to 
check the received flag value as below:
	0	--- full reconfiguration
	BIT(0) 	--- partial reconfiguration
	BIT(1) 	--- bitstream authentication

Therefore I have updated the command flag setting at Intel service layer 
driver to align with firmware.

Regards,
Richard
