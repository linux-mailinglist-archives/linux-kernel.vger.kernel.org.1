Hi Mathieu,
That works for product configuration but that would still limit internal
testing. Since there is also restriction on accessing debugfs through
userspace code, automation won't be able to run recovery/coredump tests.
Only other way for us would be to provide these sysfs entries through 
the
platform drivers locally but that would create a lot of mess/redundancy.
