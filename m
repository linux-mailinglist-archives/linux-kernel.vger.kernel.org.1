Doug,

Really sorry about the delayed response,
running power tests and getting some fuse
info took longer than expected. Yes the
mapping table as expected is a trade off
between power/perf and it has been determined
that lite version would meet the power
numbers even with the high memory votes
at lower freqs.

1900800000 --> opp-peak-kBps = <7216000 22425600>;
1996800000 --> opp-peak-kBps = <7216000 22425600>;
2112000000 --> opp-peak-kBps = <8532000 23347200>;

^^ is the new recommendation from the perf/power
QC teams for lite and is expected to have better
power numbers with similar perf.

Yes we can determine f_max by reading speed_bin
efuse values or by OSM table traversal (though
latter looks more like a hack) and use that
along with opp-supported-hw to identity supported
opps.

I would prefer If we can avoid doing ^^ if
we can get away with overloading the votes
in dt but I don't have any strong opinions
on this. So let me know how you want it done
and I'll fix it up accordingly in the next
re-spin.
