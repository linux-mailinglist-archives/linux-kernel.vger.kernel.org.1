I guess, although if we ever change how all that works, we need to
update the documentation but this is the usual thing with documentation.
Maybe it should not be documented in such a detail. :)

The kernel yes - the other two, not really. Userspace simply does CPUID
directly.

This needs to say:

It can be that the kernel doesn't support that feature and thus hasn't
enabled it.

In general, this should say something along the lines that /proc/cpuinfo
shows features which the kernel supports.

"For a full list of CPUID flags which the CPU supports, use
tools/arch/x86/tools/cpuid/cpuid"

... and that per-CPU.

... by the ... macros.
