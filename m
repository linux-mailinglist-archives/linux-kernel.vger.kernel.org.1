Yes, it's __force_order. Compressed kernel is always -fPIE, and gcc <5
and clang will generate mov instructions with GOTPCREL relocations to
load the address of __force_order into a register for use by the inline
asm. gcc-5+ works because it doesn't use GOTPCREL for global variables,
instead relying on the linker inserting copy relocations if necessary.

It's unclear if there was a real problem this fixes, but if there was
I'd expect it on native, not paravirt, given it's native that has this
__force_order hack?

gcc's documentation of volatile extended asm includes a caveat.

https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html#Volatile

Near the end of 6.47.2.1:
"Note that the compiler can move even volatile asm instructions relative
to other code, including across jump instructions."

and it provides an example of unexpected code motion, with the fix being
adding an artificial dependency to the asm.

So it might do something silly like reversing the order of two
%crn writes, maybe?
