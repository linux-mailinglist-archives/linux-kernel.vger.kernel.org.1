I will defer to Steven and Josh on the rationale.  (Cowardly of me,
I know!)

What I do is to maintain a wrapper for tracepoints within a built-in
portion of RCU, export the wrapper, and invoke the wrapper from the
rcutorture module.  Maybe you can do something similar?

But why would a module be invoked from the idle loop?  Is the module
supplying an idle driver or some such?
