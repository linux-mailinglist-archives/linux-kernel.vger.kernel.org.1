I tend to agree that any doesn't mean random and using a random cpu
will create strange behavior

One example is the irq affinity on b.L system. Right now, the irq are
always pinned to the same CPU (the 1st one which is most probably a
Little) but with your change we can imagine that this will change and
might ever change over 2 consecutives boot if for whatever reason (and
this happen) the drivers are not probed in the same order . At the end
you will run some tests with irq on little and other time irq on big.
And more generally speaking and a SMP system can be impacted because
the irq will not be pinned to the same CPU with always the same other
irqs

I agree with this point
