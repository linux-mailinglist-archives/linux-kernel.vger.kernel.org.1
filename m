kernel/sched/idle.c:do_idle() calls flush_smp_call_function_from_idle().

(nothing x86 specific about it)

IIRC (and this is after not staring at the computer for 2 weeks) lockdep
should work just fine in idle, except of course that RCU will be stopped
so actually taking locks will scream bloody murder due to tracing etc..

Not having checks also saves on $I and branches, in general I think
having checks depend on DEBUG features, esp. those we don't really
expect to trigger is still sane.

Patch looks ok, although I've seen compilers do CSE on
__this_cpu_read() (on x86).
