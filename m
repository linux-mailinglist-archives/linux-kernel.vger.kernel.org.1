Good point. I was thinking about the single CSR register consistency,
not the whole bus.

Changing the CSR behaviour at the LiteX level is something that is
currently discussed by the developers, but I'm not aware of any
timeline.
I believe we can always simplify the driver's code in the future, once
the HW becomes better suited for Linux support in the default
configuration.
