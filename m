Hi Suzuki, Mike,

To add some more to the information provided earlier, 
swao_replicator(6b06000) and etf are
in AOSS (Always-On-SubSystem) group. Also TPIU(connected to 
qdss_replicator) and EUD(connected
to swao_replicator) sinks are unused.

Please ignore the id filter values provided earlier.
Here are ID filter values after boot and before enabling replicator. As 
per
these idfilter values, we should not try to enable replicator if its 
already
enabled (in this case for swao_replicator) right?

localhost ~ # cat 
/sys/bus/amba/devices/6b06000.replicator/replicator1/mgmt/idfilter0
0x0
localhost ~ # cat 
/sys/bus/amba/devices/6b06000.replicator/replicator1/mgmt/idfilter1
0x0

localhost ~ # cat 
/sys/bus/amba/devices/6046000.replicator/replicator0/mgmt/idfilter0
0xff
localhost ~ # cat 
/sys/bus/amba/devices/6046000.replicator/replicator0/mgmt/idfilter1
0xff

I think the unused sink EUD(also in AOSS group) probably is causing the 
backpressure here.

Thanks,
Sai
