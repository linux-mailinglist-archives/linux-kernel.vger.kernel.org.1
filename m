No.

Nope.

Nope, sysfs is supposed to be "one value per file", and the buffer size
was specifically not passed in because you should _NEVER_ need to care
about it because all you are doing is printing out a single value.

If you really want to print more than just a single value, you should
not use sysfs.

So this is designed this way on purpose, you shouldn't have to worry
about any of this, and that way, you don't have to "program
defensively", it all just works in a simple manner.
