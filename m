Yup! I think this is a latent issue my debug hacks revealed (in addition
to a couple of other issues in the idle path), and still affects x86 and
others. It's only noticeable if you hack trace_hardirqs_{on,off}() to
check rcu_is_watching(), which I had at the tip of my tree.

AFAICT, the issue is that arch_cpu_idle() can be dynamically traced with
ftrace, and hence the tracing code can unexpectedly run without RCU
watching. Since that's dynamic tracing, we can avoid it by marking
arch_cpu_idle() and friends as noinstr.

I'll see about getting this fixed before we upstream the debug hack.

Thanks,
Mark.
