I've experienced some professional training classes for visiting other
countries and they tell you helpful things like "avoid making jokes
about X" or "Y topic is sensitive". It's not about censoring it's more
about how to keep discussion focused on the job at hand. So I'm hoping
this is more of the mundane advice of "what's the best way to
communicate my point efficiently to the widest possible audience" and
not a "step in a wrong direction"... time will tell.
