The problem with that is the devices will start trying to probe and
then defer due to other suppliers that are needed for probing but
haven't been linked yet. So it'll go a bit against what you are trying
to do. Also it doesn't solve the problem of already created links that
are wrong.

I'll send out a patch in reply to your email. I've been meaning to
send that outside of this discussion. It doesn't cover all cases of
cycles, but it'll cover most cases and I think it should fix your case
too.

For a more comprehensive fix, I'd like to do something like what I
explain here [1]. That should be doable for your driver too if you
want to try that approach. But I haven't heard Rob/Frank's opinion on
that.
