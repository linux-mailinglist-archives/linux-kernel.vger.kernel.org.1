No, not entirely. Btusb requires remote wakeup between open()
and close(). On a closed device it is not set to save more power.

reset_resume() is basically incompatible with remote wakeup.
Remote wakeup implies that you will ask the device to perform
some action after wakeup. A reset destroys that capability.

That is true after every suspend, whether runtime or system.
The device throws away its firmware when it does not need it.
You have control over this feature.
Hence the quirk enables remote
wakeup upon close().
That is the most important part of the original patch.

The logic on whether reset_resume() should be used is imperfect.

Technically we tell the BIOS before suspend the system whether
a device should wake up the system during sleep and hope that
the BIOS is clever enough not to cut power to them.
Compliance is mixed.

Well, no. Only between open() and close()
Please always test the case of Bluetooth not being used. I know
it is not sexy, but surprisingly common.
