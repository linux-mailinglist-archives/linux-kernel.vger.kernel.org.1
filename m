I'm just wondering what the margin of error is on the tests you are
running. What is the variance between runs? I'm just wondering if 3%
falls into the range of noise or possible changes due to just code
shifting around?

In order for the code to have shown any change it needs to be run and
I didn't see the tests triggering compaction on my test system. I'm
wondering how much memory you have available in the system you were
testing on that the test was enough to trigger compaction?

So one thing I noticed is that if you have over 128GB of memory in the
system it will fail unless you update the sysctl value
vm.max_map_count. It defaulted to somewhere close to 64K, and I
increased it 20X to 1280K in order for the test to run without failing
on the mmap calls. The other edit I had to make was the config file as
the test system I was on had about 1TB of RAM, and my home partition
only had about 800GB to spare so I had to reduce the map size from
8/10 to 5/8.

I had to install List::BinarySearch.pm. It required installing the
cpan perl libraries.

That is the only thing I can think of just based on code review.
Although that would imply multiple compact threads are running, and as
I said in my tests I never saw kcompactd wakeup so I don't think the
tests you were mentioning were enough to stress compaction.
