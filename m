Well, that's the very optimistic reading.

As the optimistic and happy person I am (hah!) I'm going to agree with
you, and plan on just merging that patch early in the next merge
window. It may fix a real bug in the current trere, but it's much too
late to apply right now, particularly with your somewhat ambiguous
results.

Oleg's theoretical race has probably never been seen, and while the
watchdog triggering is clearly a real bug, it's also extreme enough
not to really be a strong argument for merging this out-of-window..

Do you have the bug-report, just to google against anybody else
reporting something simialr>

You win some, you lose some. But yes, I'll take that as a tentative
success and that the approach is valid.

Thanks,
