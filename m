Right, I'm nearly certain that the adding and then removing is causing
a re-trigger.  I believe the loop would happen for any case where we
have a probe function that:

1. Adds devices.
2. After adding devices it decides that it needs to defer.
3. Removes the devices it added.
4. Return -EPROBE_DEFER from its probe function.

Specifically from what I know about how -EPROBE_DEFER works I'm not
sure how it wouldn't cause an infinite loop in that case.

Perhaps the missing part of my explanation, though, is why it never
gets out of this infinite loop.  In my case I purposely made the
bridge chip "ti-sn65dsi86.c" return an error (-EINVAL) in its probe
every time.  Obviously I wasn't going to get a display up like this,
but I just wanted to not loop forever at bootup.  I tracked down
exactly why we get an - EPROBE_DEFER over and over in this case.

You can see it in msm_dsi_host_register().  If some components haven't
shown up when that function runs it will _always_ return
-EPROBE_DEFER.

In my case, since I caused the bridge to fail to probe, those
components will _never_ show up.  That means that
msm_dsi_host_register() will _always_ return -EPROBE_DEFER.

I haven't dug through all the DRM code enough, but it doesn't
necessarily seem like the wrong behavior.  If the bridge driver or a
panel was a module then (presumably) they could show up later and so
it should be OK for it to defer, right?

So with all that, it doesn't really feel like this is a bug so much as
it's an unsupported use case.  The current deferral logic simply can't
handle the case we're throwing at it.  You cannot return -EPROBE_DEFER
if your probe function adds devices each time through the probe
function.

Assuming all the above makes sense, that means we're stuck with:

a) This patch series, which makes us not add devices.

b) Some other patch series which rearchitects the MSM graphics stack
to not return -EPROBE_DEFER in this case.

c) Smarten up the deferral system to somehow detect this loop.  I'm
really not sure how to do this.  You'd have to somehow know that you
keep adding the same devices over and over again and they didn't get
us out of the deferral loop last time and so you should eventually
give up.

Hrm.  How does that work?  Let's see...

...ah, I believe it works because we don't try to grab interrupts in
the probe path of our sub-components.  That means we probe them just
fine without the parent.  I guess it has to be like this because
otherwise we end up with circular dependencies.

So there is a dependency of the child on the parent and of the parent
on the child (the parent won't really probe until the children do).
No idea if this means that the whole thing was architected in a
non-optimal way or if it's just really hard to fit the DRM Component
model into the Linux Driver model (or both).  Where does that leave us
about whether "simple-bus" is OK, though?

Maybe now that I've pointed at msm_dsi_host_register() it will help
clarify.  I don't know a ton about the MSM DRM world (mostly I just
jumped in here because I was sick of getting stuck in this infinite
loop), but I'm not sure how we can get around the problems.

I guess in my specific case we could maybe determine that the bridge
chip returned -EINVAL and thus would never probe, but what about if I
put the bridge chip driver in a loadable kernel module?

My device links knowledge is super weak (and I'm currently mostly
focused on the slightly older 5.4 kernel if that matters) but are you
saying that the system should just know which device would eventually
provide the bridge/panel and would know not to probe the main DRM
driver until after it probes?
