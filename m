DT-based PMU registration looks good to me. Together with Anup's feedback,
we can anticipate that the following items will be:

- rewrite RISC-V PMU to a platform driver
- propose SBI PMU extention
- fixes: RV32 counter access, namings, etc.

Yes, all are good directions towards better counting (`perf stat`) function.
But as the original author of RISC-V perf port, please allow me to address
the fundamental problems of RISC-V perf, again [0][1][2][3], that the sampling
(`perf record`) function never earned enough respect.  Counting gives you a
shallow view regarding an application, while sampling demystifies one for you.

The problems are three-fold
(1) Interrupt
Sampling in perf requires that a HPM raises an interrupt when it overflows.
Making RISC-V perf platform driver or not has nothing to do with this.  This
requires more discussions in TGs.
(2) S-mode access to PMU CSRs
This is also addressed in this patch set but to me, it is kind of like a
SBI-solves-them-all mindset to me.  Perf event is for performance monitoring
thus we should eliminate any possible overhead if we can.  Setting event masks
through SBI calls for counting maybe OK, but if we really take sampling and
interrupt handling into consideration, it is questionable if it is still a
viable way.
(3) Registers, registers, registers
There is just no enough CSR/function for perf sampling. The previous proposal
explains why [2].

Perf sampling is off-topic but somehow related, so I bring it up here just
for your information.

As this patch set goes v2, the PMU porting guide in [0] should be removed since
it contains no useful information anymore.

    This proposal has been posted in Privileged Spec Task Group, in
https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-privileged-archive/message/488?p=,,,20,0,0,0::Created,,Proposal,20,2,40,32306071
but never receive any feedback.

    I intended to discuss [2] in the Unixplatform Spec Task Group at the
online meeting, but obviously people were too busy knowing who the new
RISC-V CTO is and what he has done to even follow the agenda.
