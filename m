Ok, I applied this already, we can fix this in the next cycle.

perhaps if we just add a blank line to separate groups? I.e. the above
would be:

[root@seventh ~]# perf stat -e '{power/energy-cores/,power/energy-ram/},{instructions,cycles}' -a sleep 2

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

              1.73 Joules power/energy-cores/
              0.92 Joules power/energy-ram/

        12,191,658        instructions              #    0.67  insn per cycle
        18,275,233        cycles

       2.001272492 seconds time elapsed

[root@seventh ~]#

Humm, in the presence of at least one group, any ungrouped events would
have to be also separated, i.e.:

[root@seventh ~]# perf stat -e '{power/energy-cores/,power/energy-ram/},instructions,cycles' -a sleep 2

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

              1.73 Joules power/energy-cores/
              0.92 Joules power/energy-ram/

        12,191,658        instructions              #    0.67  insn per cycle

        18,275,233        cycles

       2.001272492 seconds time elapsed

[root@seventh ~]#
