OK, with Al's help, here is the situation.

If I use a regular file instead of a directory, the mount
command succeeds.

The printk() from fs/bfs/inode.c that uses the WARNING: string
is not a WARN() or WARN_ON(). It's just a printk().

<linux/asm-generic/bug.h> says:

 * Do not include "BUG"/"WARNING" in format strings manually to make these
 * conditions distinguishable from kernel issues.

so if I change fs/bfs/inode.c to use "warning:" or "Warning," or "Note:",
this little problem should go away.  Is that correct?


thanks.
