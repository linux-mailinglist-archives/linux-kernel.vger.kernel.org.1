Not sure I get your point. Disabling it while U-Boot is still running
poses a security risk (even if arguably tiny), while doing it once the
the Kernel is running is  totally safe. So, I'd prefer to do it in the
Kernel, unless practical reasons prevent it.

True, U-Boot data needs to be protected too and, in fact, we're trying
to do that as well. Other IMRs are used to protect the kernel, dtb, and
other critical memory sections.

Yes, that's definitely the simplest solution, but, IMO, not the safest
one. So, I'd prefer to build on your initial suggestion and Arnd's
advice and create a new device driver to disable the IMR once Linux is
running. But, yes, if that eventually proves unfeasible, I might just
have the bootloader disable the protection right before booting the OS.
