That is fair enough, we have transitioned since then to using SPIs and
that appears to work nicely for what we want to do without requiring
your patch series.

In premise it is still possible for someone to specify 0x561 as the
first interrupt cell specifier  in the Device Tree in order to specify a
SGI interrupt and this will happily be parsed as a valid interrupt.

It would most likely fail some time later while trying to set the
interrupt type though. I do not think you can do better than this, as
there is no way for you to know the caller of gic_irq_domain_translate()
and reject them.
