Correct, which further underscores the point that I am trying make, it
is unclear what the current mmap/mprotect protection architecture is
accomplishing, since it only enforces EPCM permissions.  The hardware
is perfectly capable of doing so without assistance from the operating
system, in fact, the very reason it was designed was to provide
protections in the face of an adversarial operating system.

For precisely one year, as of next week, we have engaged in a
re-design of this driver, driven by the concern that the previous
driver allowed execution of code that bypassed the LSM.  So I'm
assuming the community has concerns about the possibility of anonymous
code execution.  If this is the case, the mmap/mprotect protection
code in the driver should be implementing some type of control over
the execution of anonymous memory, which our patch implements, very
simply and very understandably.

The other straight forward alternative is a knob that tells the driver
to disallow the addition of any page that attempts to set EPCM.XW
permissions.

As always, corrections gladly accepted if our analysis of the driver
or how the hardware itself works is incorrect.
