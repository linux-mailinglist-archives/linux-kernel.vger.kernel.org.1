Again, very happy with the overall approach, just a few quibbles.

Funny you should say that!

I don't really like that extra argument although it is nothing to do
with simplifying merges...

This is, IMHO, too subtle.

I don't think this is merely a warning with a gentle message about
neutering. IIUC the system is (or will shortly be) dead in the water.
After diligently stopping all the CPUs the debug-core will then start
waiting for a character that cannot possibly come!

I think this might be one of those vanishingly rare places where
panicing might actually the right thing to do... although only after 
neutering" the kgdb panic handler first ;-).

This is normally taken care of by debug-core.c . Could this be
integrated into kgdb_register_io_module() ?

As I said I'm not a big fan of the extra argument. It makes the call
sites harder to read.

Could earlycon_kgdboc be registered with a boolean flag set so that
a subsequent register will automatically replace the old one
(maybe "is_replaceable" or "is_temporary")?

For bonus marks the core could also enforce that a replaceable io ops
table must have init set to null (because there is no deinit).
