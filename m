That is my understanding, yes. As of commit 8f21d8e939b8 ("i8k:
Autodetect fan RPM multiplier"), an explicit fan_mult from driver_data
is not needed on any machine where i8k_get_fan_nominal_speed()
works. The email thread I linked from my commit message, specifically
message #13 from Gabriele Mazzotta[1], indicates that function works
on the XPS 13 9333, as it did on all other laptops tested in that thread.
The only other information in driver_data is fan_max, which defaults to
I8K_FAN_HIGH and so won't change for the XPS 13 9333.

Note that the version of the autodetection code which actually
landed[2] (which, coincidentally, was part of the same series
containing your initial XPS 13 support) fixed the bugs mentioned
in [1] and properly tries i8k_get_fan_nominal_speed() for all fans.

What fallout are you imagining? There are two XPS 15 models, 9560
and 9570, that were already matched, neither of which required
driver_data or were blacklisted for bad BIOS behavior., and I've tested
on a 9350 with the same result.

The worst case scenario I could imagine is that one of 9550, 9360, or
9370 has bad BIOS behavior and starts showing hiccups after this
patch. I don't think that's likely, though, given that the list of tested
models includes one from each generation, sampling across both 13
and 15. Additionally, the existing generic matches on "Studio",
"inspiron", "Latitude", "Precision", and "Vostro" indicate that we're
willing to accept the possibility of future breakage in exchange for
automatic detection of new machines.
