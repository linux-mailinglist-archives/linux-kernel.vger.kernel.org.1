Subject: [PATCH] ARM: keystone: Replace HTTP links with HTTPS ones
Date:   Mon, 13 Jul 2020 09:19:21 +0200
Message-Id: <20200713071921.31918-1-grandmaster@al2klimov.de>

X-Spam: Yes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Rationale:
Reduces attack surface on kernel devs opening the links for MITM
as HTTPS traffic is much harder to manipulate.

Deterministic algorithm:
For each file:
  If not .svg:
    For each line:
      If doesn't contain `\bxmlns\b`:
        For each link, `\bhttp://[^# \t\r\n]*(?:\w|/)`:
	  If neither `\bgnu\.org/license`, nor `\bmozilla\.org/MPL\b`:
            If both the HTTP and HTTPS versions
            return 200 OK and serve the same content:
              Replace HTTP with HTTPS.

 Continuing my work started at 93431e0607e5.
 See also: git log --oneline '--author=Alexander A. Klimov <grandmaster@al2klimov.de>' v5.7..master
 (Actually letting a shell for loop submit all this stuff for me.)

 If there are any URLs to be removed completely or at least not just HTTPSified:
 Just clearly say so and I'll *undo my change*.
 See also: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/6/27/64

 If there are any valid, but yet not changed URLs:
 See: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/6/26/837

 If you apply the patch, please let me know.

 Sorry again to all maintainers who complained about subject lines.
 Now I realized that you want an actually perfect prefixes,
 not just subsystem ones.
 I tried my best...
 And yes, *I could* (at least half-)automate it.
 Impossible is nothing! :)
