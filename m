Partly, yes: but that's just a racy check to avoid doing wasted work in
common cases; the more important check comes later in page_ref_freeze(),
which either fails, or prevents anyone else taking a new reference to
the THP (head or tails) while all the work on splitting is being done.

Yes.

Okay.  That's definitely a good way to start out - but you may find
that the second step leads you to rewrite every line you wrote before!
