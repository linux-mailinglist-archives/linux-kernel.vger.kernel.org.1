I think "sifive,clint*" is the way to go here.  The Free Chips Foundation owns
Rocket Chip, which contains an implementation of SiFive's CLINT specification,
but as far as I can tell Free Chips itself does not produce a specification for
the CLINT.  The only CLINT specifications I can find are for SiFive's chips and
are copyright SiFive, and we generally prefer sticking to specifications rather
than implementations for these sorts of things.

To be honest, I'm not even sure the Free Chips CLINT is an implementation of
the SiFive specification: we don't have the source code for those chips, and
while I'm fairly sure the Chisel source code for the CLINT itself on SiFive's
chips is very close to what was in Rocket Chip at the time those chips were
built (though we don't have the source, so we don't know for user), device
specifications depend on the broader SOC context they are embedded inside.  For
example: SiFive's CLINT allows us to use simple MMIO reads of mtime to meet the
RISC-V rdtime requirements, but other bus configurations may not meet those
requirement<F6><F5>s.

If Free Chips publishes a specification for a CLINT and it's compatible with
this version of SiFive's CLINT then I don't see any reason why we couldn't add
that as a compatible string, but as it currently stands there is no Free Chips
CLINT specification.  IMO it would be irresponsible for us to define one on
their behalf.

I don't know anything about Kendryte's specifications, as I haven't read them
myself.  Assuming they define the CLINT's behavior in their SOC manual, then
adding something along the lines of "canaan,kendryte-k210-clint" seems
reasonable to me -- don't really care that much about the specific name, but as
we don't define the Kendryte SOCs then calling it anything more general than
this specific SOC's CLINT seems unreasonable.  AFAIK the Kendryte people don't
get involved with Linux development directly, so that's probably as much as we
can define.
