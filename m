We have a trace_seq p helper, that lets you create strings in
TP_printk(). I should document this more. Thus you can do:

extern const char *audit_perm_to_name(struct trace_seq *p, u16 class, u32 audited);
#define __perm_to_name(p, class, audited) audit_perm_to_name(p, class, audited)

	TP_printk("tclass=%u audited=%x (%s)",
		__entry->tclass,
		__entry->audited,
		__perm_to_name(__entry->tclass, __entry->audited))


const char *audit_perm_to_name(struct trace_seq *p, u16 tclass, u32 av)
{
	const char *ret = trace_seq_buffer_ptr(p);
	int i, perm;

	( some check for tclass integrity here)

	perms = secclass_map[tclass-1].perms;

	i = 0;
	perm = 1;
	while (i < (sizeof(av) * 8)) {
		if ((perm & av) && perms[i]) {
			trace_seq_printf(p, " %s", perms[i]);
			av &= ~perm;
		}
		i++;
		perm <<= 1;
	}

	return ret;
}

Note, this wont work for perf and trace-cmd as it wouldn't know how to
parse it, but if the tclass perms are stable, you could create a plugin
to libtraceevent that can do the above as well.
