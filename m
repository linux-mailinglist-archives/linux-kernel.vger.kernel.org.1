Certainly if that upper bound is defined and enforced somewhere we would 
not have run into this issue causing all userspace to become completely 
unresponsive.  Do you have links to patches that proposed enforcing this 
upper bound?  It seems like it would have to be generic to 
__alloc_pages_slowpath() because otherwise multiple different GFP_ATOMIC 
allocators, all from different sources, couldn't orchestrate their memory 
allocations amongst themselves to enforce this upper bound.  They would 
need to work together to ensure they don't conspire to cause this 
depletion.  I'd be happy to take a look if there are links to other 
approaches.
