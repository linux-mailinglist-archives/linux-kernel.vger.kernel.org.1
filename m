Well, as you said, when parsing we don't know on which machine we are
running so let's keep parsing it anyway.

Yes, I think we need to enforce standby_mode=standby and
suspend_mode=ulp0 for rm9200 and at91sam9. This is how it always have
been.

You have two ways of doing that:

Etiher you enforce the values after parsing, in at91rm9200_pm_init and
at91sam9_pm_init. Or, when parsing your store the values in a different
location than soc_pm.data and update soc_pm.data only in sama5_pm_init,
sama5d2_pm_init and sam9x60_pm_init. I feel like the first solution is
easier.
