I disagree. The pcp draining is an implementation detail and we
shouldn't bother callers to be aware of it.

This is an implementation detail.

Again this just leads to tricky code. Just look at how easy it was to
break this by removing something that looked clearly a duplicate call.
It is true that memory isolation usage is limited to only few usecasaes
but I would strongly prefer to make the semantic clear so that we do not
repeat this regressions.
