I considered that but it appeared to be far more complex as I would
have to validate all the interactions with my other userspace apps.

I haven't tested this but I suspect there may also be issues having
userspace code access these control messages, especially since
I build the ftdi_sio driver into my kernels rather than using a module.

I figured this would be useful for anyone with these bricked devices
as I have wasted a lot of time debugging this issue since I wasn't
expecting the ID's to have changed.

I'm assuming it happened because I use USB hubs and firmware was
being flashed for different hub attached hardware devices by moving
the entire hub to Windows even though the userspace arduino control
application doesn't run on Windows at the moment.

I can't think of any case where this would be harmful as I have
plenty of sanity checks before fixing the brick to ensure it only
unbricks devices that have the preimage attack signature.

This is an annoying enough issue that I think autofixing makes sense
simply so that everyone can avoid wasting time debugging the issue
manually.
