Are you really talking about throttling, or reclaim? If throttling, tasks are 
already throttled proportionally to how much this allocation is contributing to 
the overage in calculate_high_delay.

If you're talking about reclaim, trying to reason about whether the overage is 
the result of some other task in this cgroup or the task that's allocating 
right now is something that we already know doesn't work well (eg. global OOM).

memcg_nr_pages_over_high is related to the charge size. As such, if you're way 
over memory.high as a result of transient reclaim failures, but the majority of 
your charges are small, it's going to hard to make meaningful progress:

1. Most nr_pages will be MEMCG_CHARGE_BATCH, which is not enough to help;
2. Large allocations will only get a single reclaim attempt to succeed.

As such, in many cases we're either doomed to successfully reclaim a paltry 
amount of pages, or fail to reclaim a lot of pages. Asking try_to_free_pages() 
to deal with those huge allocations is generally not reasonable, regardless of 
the specifics of why it doesn't work in this case.
