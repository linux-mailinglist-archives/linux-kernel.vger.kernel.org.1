The issue is not that I can't see that there might be a problem.  The
issue I have is that you seem to be starting from the point of a
specific solution that happens to work for your systems and then working
back from that rather than reasoning forwards from the problem to come
to a solution with the result that I can't explain the design you're
proposing.  Even with this version I have difficulty telling from the
changelog that the change doesn't restrict things based on the consumers
of a given regulator but rather based on the PMIC and I don't see why
this is being done.

Oh, the Qualcomm stuff - which looks a lot like what you've got here.

I don't see how any of this stuff about initcall chicken or whatever is
relevant here.  You're replying to my concern that your change isn't
just waiting for all the consumers of a given regulator, it's waiting
for every other consumer of any other regulator or random other feature
that happens to be supplied by the same PMIC but only that PMIC.  That
is not init ordering, it just seems like an arbitrary delay even once
all the consumers are ready and I can't see any particular logic behind
it.  It's not just waiting for all the users of the individual resource
to be active but it's also not waiting for the system as a whole,
instead it's waiting for some effectively random grouping of devices
spread over the whole system to appear.  I can't articulate a reason why
we'd do that, it seems to be combining the worst aspects of the two
approaches.

Please engage with this issue, it is crucial but you keep on sending the
same thing without explaining why so I'm left guessing and I really
can't come up with anything.

It's also preventing turning off regulators that don't have any
consumers at all, not even potential ones.  Those are the main target
for the cleanup of idle regulators.

I don't follow what you're saying here at all, sorry.  What does the
depth of the dependency graph have to do with how late we action
anything?  A lot of what you're saying here seems to be based on jumping
to abandoning deferred probe which is a bit of a leap here.

Run the initcall when all devices in the system have a driver bound
which as far as I can tell seems to be what the end result of this
series is intended to be anyway, just implemented with much more
complexity.  That doesn't need any involvement from userspace, though I
can't see why we'd want to do that rather than just work per regulator.

There's *need* to and there's can do on systems that can support the
thing, the same driver will often be able to handle both situations.
This also goes to a risk of regressions, it's a fairly major
transformation to be doing.  These issues would be massively mitigated
if this were per regulator as I have repeatedly suggested.

Or just don't set constraints which alow things to be changed until
you're ready...

That's a new one, the normal thing would've been to let the driver load
and then remove it to load whatever test stuff.  I'm not sure that's
super practical to be honest, taking advantage of it really does seem to
require a vertically integrated system where the DT exactly matches what
you want at runtime.

Right, that's an issue but there seem to be less invasive solutions.

Having the requests from drivers be acted on promptly is also a
potential correctness and robustness issue.  You seem very focused on
the disabling of unused regulators for power reasons case but that's
really not the only thing going on here, there's also just the need to
control things as part of what the device is supposed to be doing.
Systems aren't always built to let us do all the things we're really
supposed to do with hardware so it's often advantageous to have drivers
that will do these things but cope gracefully, this means that it
doesn't always make sense to use exclusive gets even where you really
actually want things to happen as requested if they can.  Often the
devices are in practice robust enough most of the time things are fine
if the requests get ignored which is why systems can be built that way
but strictly we're not supposed to do that so where we can we should
avoid it.  Forcing consumers to be exclusive means that we need to add a
call that lets these consumers figure out which kind of get to use and
then have the consumer have multiple code paths for that (or more
realistically factor that out into the core, but then we could even more
easily just not have the system wide restrictions).

There's also issues around being able to reason about what the system is
supposed to do and why, hence my concerns about waiting for all devices
on the PMIC to appear.  Like I said above this is absolutely crucial.
