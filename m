Sorry for the late reply, and thanks for the explanations.  That definitely
helped me to understand.

So, which way should we go?

I kind of prefer the new suggestion to remove code rather than adding new
codes.  I definitely don't know enough on the side effect of it, especially
performance-wise on either ksm or swap, but... IIUC the worst case is we'll get
some perf report later on, and it seems also not hard to revert the patch later
if we want.

Thanks,
