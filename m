Subject: [PATCH] kgdboc: Be a bit more robust about handling earlycon leaving
Date:   Thu, 30 Apr 2020 09:59:09 -0700
Message-Id: <20200430095819.1.Id37f71c69eb21747b9d9e2c7c242be130814b362@changeid>

The original implementation of kgdboc_earlycon included a comment
about how it was impossible to get notified about the boot console
going away without making changes to the Linux core.  Since folks
often don't want to change the Linux core for kgdb's purposes, the
kgdboc_earlycon implementation did a bit of polling to figure out when
the boot console went away.

It turns out, though, that it is possible to get notified about the
boot console going away.  The solution is either clever or a hack
depending on your viewpoint.  ...or, perhaps, a clever hack.  All we
need to do is head-patch the "exit" routine of the boot console.  We
know that "struct console" must be writable because it has a "next"
pointer in it, so we can just put our own exit routine in, do our
stuff, and then call back to the original.

This works great to get notified about the boot console going away.
The (slight) problem is that in the context of the boot console's exit
routine we can't call tty_find_polling_driver().  We solve this by
kicking off some work on the system_wq when we get notified and this
works pretty well.

This is all still not perfect but seems as good you'll be able to do
without more intrusive changes to the Linux core.  It feels like the
window where the debugger isn't available should be tiny on all
systems now, even those systems that manage to init their tty earlier.

This is based upon Daniel's recent patch [1] which is, in turn, based
on my recent series [2].  In theory this patch could be folded into
the patches of the original series, but presumably it will be less
churn / spamming of people to just treat it as a patch atop.  I wish I
had thought of this trick earlier, but I suppose these kinds of things
only occur to people at 4 am in bed when they can't sleep.
