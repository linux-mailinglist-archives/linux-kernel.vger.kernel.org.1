IIRC we didn't go for this initially because hackbench behaved slightly
worse with it. Did we end up re-evaluating this? Also, how does this reaim
benchmark behave with it? I *think* the table from that regression thread
says it behaves better, but I had a hard time parsing it (seems like it got
damaged by line wrapping)

Conceptually I'm all for it, so as long as the tests back it up:
