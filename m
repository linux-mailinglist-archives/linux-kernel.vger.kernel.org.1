Which leans toward confirming the impression I had while reading your
previous response, i.e. you stopped reading at the name change
observation, which would be _just_ a nit-picking, although still worth
IMHO.

Instead, I went further and asked you to consider a different approach:
not adding a new kernel symbol to represent a concept already there.

Then you could have just called out that instead of silently ignoring
the comment/proposal.

Perhaps it would not confuse only me having 'something_enabled()'
referring to 'something_used'.

Your answer was about a name change, don't see correlation with a
different approach... but should be just me.

You sure know that sometime reviewing code can be an "hard work" too, so I
would not go down that way at all with the discussion. Quite likely I
have a different "subjective" view on how Open Source development works.

Good, this is the simple and small reply I've politely asked for.

Best,
