It's a bit more involved -- we also need to fiddle with some HW state
(PSTATE.PAN, PSTATE.UAO, and TTBR0 for SW_PAN) because SDEI isn't a real
exception, so we have to simulate what HW (or the usual exception code)
does for exception entry/return.

It's simple enough to handle, but requires some refactoring as we now
rely on force_uaccess_{begin,end}() having those HW side-effects. I'll
probably factor that out into new arm64-specific helpers for simulating
exception entry/return (which we used to open-code)Â since it's the only
special case and that'll be clearer than repurposing generic helpers to
do so.

I'll keep an eye out!

Mark.
