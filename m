This problem is not so obvious, because it will not cause any exceptions
but will show "old" stack always ending with switch_to, I finally confirmed
the problem through debugging.

For example:Task blocked in spinlock/interrupt/busy loop, I want to print
the backtrace when detected(like PSI in Android), the printing is wrong(old).

I will use task_cpu(tsk) instead of tsk->cpu, and add task_running_oncpu() in
include/linux/sched.h instead of tsk->on_cpu, but as you said, by this patch,
we can still race and miss cases where the task was runnning as we backtrace.

But from the user's perspective, printing wrong backtrace is confused when
we call this function while task already running. However, it's reasonable to
print the last backtrace when task enter running during the function is called.

Thanks,
Wang Qing.
