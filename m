Well, I need a formal ACK, or even better have the arch maintainer
pick it up, as that is how development is normally supposed to work.

FYI, if you want to reduce the amount of crap you get Cced on, you can
add yourself to .get_maintainer.ignore file in the kernel tree, as
that at least removes a lot of the pass by cleanups found from git
log.

We had the discussion before and things like the sh5 removal and
device tree switch came out of it.  But since then exactly nothing
has happened - the arch code is still pretty much unmaintained and
impossible to get a review for.  No one expects super quick responses
for a legacy architecture, but if there is no way to get feedback
or patches queued up while the code keeps on bitrotting the architecture
is effectively dead.  I have no personal problem with the sh hardware,
but if we want a Linux port to survive it will need at least a minimum
amount of active maintainance.
