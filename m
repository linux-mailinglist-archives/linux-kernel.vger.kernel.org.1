So the counting is actually not the hard part for us, it's figuring
out when we have finished. Again, the change that I am working on (I
REALLY need to get that out) should fix that, but until we get that
upstream, KUnit doesn't actually know when it is done running tests.

Yeah, I also prefer spaces and/or "#". I am okay if spaces are
optional only to aid human readability. And honestly I don't care
about this point too much. Just offering my 2 cents.
