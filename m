As long as you don't try to modularise a driver that does both DT and
ACPI, you'll be safe. I'm also actively trying to discourage people
from inventing custom irqchips on ACPI platforms (the spec almost
forbids them, but not quite).

Uhuh. I'm afraid that's not a practical solution. We need to offer the
same behaviour for both and not rely on the user to understand the
topology of the SoC.

Seems like an interesting option. Two things then:

- Can we enforce the use of fw_devlink for modularized irqchips?
- For those irqchips that can be modularized, it is apparent that they
   should have been written as platform devices the first place. Maybe
   we should just do that (long term, though).

Thanks,
