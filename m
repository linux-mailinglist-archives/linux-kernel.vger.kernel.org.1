Sorry. I misunderstood the question. I think it is kept at the start
of dram to accommodate
embedded systems with smaller memory. It was also easier to manage at
the beginning of
the memory because all other next stages in the boot process just
ignores first few KBs of
the memory. We also did not have a memory reservation scheme back then.

Having said that, this parameter is configurable for each platform in
OpenSBI. In future, this restriction
can be relaxed if a platform vendor wants. IIRC, linux kernel can't
use  the memory below the kernel start
address (where PAGE_OFFSET is mapped) because of generic mm code limitations.
