For smaller devices, the memory overhead was too high. (i.e. 4x more
memory allocated to kernel stacks -- 4k vs 1k per thread.) The series
is much more than just a stack exhaustion defense, so I don't think that
detail needs to block the entire series. FWIW, I'd like to have both modes
(contiguous and vmap) available so that system builders can choose their
trade-off. Both will gain return address corruption defense, but the
vmap case will protect against neighboring SCS corruption in the face
of very-unlikely-but-technically-possible stack exhaustion (remember
that with the elimination of VLAs, the stack depth compile time
checking, and the regular stack VMAP guard page, it will be quite
difficult to exhaust the SCS -- either because there is no code path to
accomplish it, or because it would trip the regular stack guard page
first).
