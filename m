This is not fully true. More important messages will still be printed
to the console. The debug messages will not be skipped before the
older messages are proceed.

I mean that many debug messages might cause losing more important ones
before the old important messages are proceed.

No, LOG_LINE_MAX is too big to be allocated on stack.

Well, it would be possible to call vsprintf() with NULL buffer. It is
normally used to calculate the length of the message before it is
printed. But it also does all the accesses without printing anything.

OK, we could try this via some test branch that will go into
linux-next but it would not be scheduled for the next merge window.

For the testing, this patch might be good enough.

For eventual upstreaming, I would prefer to handle this in
lib/dynamic_debug.c by enabling all entries by default. This
would solve all DYNAMIC_DEBUG_BRANCH() users at one place.

Anyway, I would like to see a proof that it really helped to find
some bugs an easier way before upstreaming.

Petr
