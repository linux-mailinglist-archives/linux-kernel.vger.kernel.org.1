Hmmm, if we cannot get some kind of Documentation of what it means and
review the code, then I do not see a point in getting this into kernel.

As kernel community we would like to see some form of Documentation
associated with the patches on what this means.

If that is not possible due to MIPI regulations, maybe deferring
this would make sense
