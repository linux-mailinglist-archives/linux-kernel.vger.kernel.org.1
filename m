ARM SMMU and ARM SMMU v3 do this and so does virtio-iommu. Pretty much
all the other drivers for ARM platforms have their own variations of
tegra_smmu_find() using of_find_device_by_node() at some point.

What others do differently is that they call of_find_device_by_node()
=66rom ->of_xlate(), which is notably different from what we do in
tegra-smmu (where we call it from ->probe_device()). It's entirely
possible that we can do that as well, which is what we've been
discussing in a different sub-thread, but like I mentioned there I do
recall that being problematic, otherwise I wouldn't have left all the
comments in the code.

If we can determine that moving this to ->of_xlate() works fine in all
cases, then I think that's something that we should do for tegra-smmu to
become more consistent with other drivers.

That's nonsense. There's no such thing as "modern" drivers is Linux
because they are constantly improved. Yes, ARM SMMU may have legacy code
paths, but that's because it has been around for much longer than others
and therefore is much more mature.

I can't say much about sun50i-iommu because I'm not familiar with it,
but I have seen plenty of "modern" drivers that turn out to be much
worse than "old" drivers. New doesn't always mean better.

This doesn't really have anything to do with the IOMMU core code. This
has to do with platform and firmware code, so the IOMMU core is only
marginally involved.
