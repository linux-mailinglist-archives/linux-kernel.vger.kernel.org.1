fw_devlink doesn't have any config and it's a command line option. So
not sure how you can enforce that.

I agree. If they can be platform devices, they should be. But when
those platform device drivers are built in, you'll either need:
1) fw_devlink=on to enforce the topological init order
Or
2) have a generic irqchip probe helper function that ensures that.
My patch with some additional checks added to platform_irqchip_probe()
can provide (2).

In the short term, my patch series also makes it easier to convert
existing non-platform drivers into platform drivers.

So if I fix up platform_irqchip_probe() to also do -EPROBE_DEFER to
enforce topology, will that make this patch acceptable?
