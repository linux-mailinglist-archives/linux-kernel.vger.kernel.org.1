Once again, get rid of this paragraph - it doesn't have much to do with 
the *default* value since it describes a behaviour general to any 
boundary mask. Plus it effectively says "if a driver uses a DMA-mapped 
scatterlist incorrectly, this change can help paper over the bug", which 
is rather the opposite of a good justification.

(for example most SATA devices end up with a 64KB boundary mask, such 
that padding the IOVAs to provide the appropriate alignment happens very 
frequently, and they've been working just fine for years now)
