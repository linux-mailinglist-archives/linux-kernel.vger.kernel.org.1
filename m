But we can't... because I need arch_atomic_*() and __READ_ONCE() to not
call out to _ANYTHING_.

Sadly, because the compilers are 'broken' that whole __no_sanitize thing
didn't work, but I'll be moving a whole bunch of code into .c files with
all the sanitizers killed dead. And we'll be validating it'll not be
calling out to anything.

data_race() will include active calls to kcsan_{dis,en}able_current(),
and this must not happen.
