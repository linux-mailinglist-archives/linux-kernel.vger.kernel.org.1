Yes there are complex use cases, but if we look at the amount of changes 
required in simple-card driver that is not too much. Existing binding 
for simple-card driver would still work fine for our cases. Yes there 
are some deviations and we don't want to break existing users, that is 
why a *new* compatible was introduced and specific items can be pushed 
under it. Majority of the simple-card driver is getting re-used here. We 
just need to make sure it does not affect anyone else.

Don't we use the same methodology for CODEC<->CODEC link and still 
describe the DAI link with 'cpu@0' and 'codec@0'?

> Using fe/be instead of cpu/codec is easy to understand.
I guess you are referring to DT binding part. The parsing code 
specifically looks for "codec" sub node and thus present conventions had 
to be used.
