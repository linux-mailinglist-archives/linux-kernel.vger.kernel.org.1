Well, we do mark_page_accessed() when pinning in GUP. This is not perfect
but it's as good as it gets with CPU having no control when the page is
actually accessed. Also taking the page off and then back to LRU list would
increase the contention on the LRU list locks and generally cost
performance so for short term pins it is not desirable... Otherwise I agree
that conceptually it would make some sence although I'm not sure some
places wouldn't get confused by e.g. page cache pages not being on LRU
list.
