Thank you for these details!

It seems feasible to include the restrictions during io_uring_setup().

The only doubt concerns the possibility of allowing the trusted code to
do some operations, before passing queues to the untrusted code, for
example registering file descriptors, buffers, eventfds, etc.

To avoid this, I should include these operations in io_uring_setup(),
adding some code that I wanted to avoid by reusing io_uring_register().

If I add restrictions in io_uring_setup() and then add an operation to
go into safe mode (e.g. a flag in io_uring_enter()), we would have the same
problem, right?

Just to be clear, I mean something like this:

    /* params will include restrictions */
    fd = io_uring_setup(entries, params);

    /* trusted code */
    io_uring_register_files(fd, ...);
    io_uring_register_buffers(fd, ...);
    io_uring_register_eventfd(fd, ...);

    /* enable safe mode */
    io_uring_enter(fd, ..., IORING_ENTER_ENABLE_RESTRICTIONS);


Anyway, including a list of things to register in the 'params', passed
to io_uring_setup(), should be feasible, if Jens agree :-)

Thanks,
Stefano
