In your example, which cfs_ rq has been throttled ? cfs_a ?

so cfs_c is added with the 1st loop

hmm I don't understand the link between cfs_b been added and cfs_a->on_list=1

cfs_b is added with 2nd loop because its throttle_count > 0 due to
cfs_a been throttled (purpose of this patch)

So 2nd loop breaks because cfs_a is throttled

The 3rd loop will add cfs_a

Mainly to be conservative because as this patch demonstrates, there
are a lot of possible use cases and combinations and I can't ensure
that it is always safe to use the throttled_hierarchy.
