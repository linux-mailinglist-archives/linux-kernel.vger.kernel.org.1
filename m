Subject: [PATCH v6 0/3] SCMI System Power Support

Hi all,

this series wants to add the core SCMI System Power support and related
events' handling logic: the protocol support itself is trivial and boils
down to some bare initializations and supporting one SCMI System Power
notification event meant to carry platform-originated System transition
requests. This is patch [1/3].

Patch [2/3] simply adds a new System Power device name to the core driver.

On top of this a new SCMI driver has been developed which registers for
such System Power notification and acts accordingly to satisfy such plaform
system-state transition requests that can be of forceful or graceful kind.

In order to comply with such graceful requests, and co-operate with
userspace entities to drive a clean shutdown/reboot, the logic of the
driver relies on the same orderly_* API methods used by ACPI when handling
ACPI Shutdown bus events.
As an alternative method to tunnel graceful requests to userspace it is
possible to configure, via available module parameters, a specific signal
to be sent to CAD pid. This is patch [3/3].

Based on v5.9-rc4
(which now includes needed SCMI Notifications Core Support)

Thanks

Cristian

----
v5 --> v6
- rebased on v5.9-rc4
- removed DEBUG Juno dts example
- split out "syspower" device definition from System Power Control driver
  into its own patch
- fixe ret usage in syspower_control _probe/_remove

v4 --> v5
- rebased on v5.9-rc1
