Good. Then the next problem you will likely face is that building QCOM
ABL is far from being straightforward. Why would it be? ;)
That's the script we use to build it ourselves:
https://git.linaro.org/ci/job/configs.git/tree/lt-qcom-bootloader/dragonboard845c/builders.sh#n61

It has a reference to sectools which we have (internally) access to,
but you have it too, and you should be able to leverage most of the
script.
