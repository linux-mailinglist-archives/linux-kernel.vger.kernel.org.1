I do not like the idea that a device would be woken up, that kind of
defeats the whole idea behind the runtime pm. Waking up a device to
check the events is a generic sdw concept, I don't see that as Intel
specific one.

I would like to see a generic callback for the devices and let devices
do the resume part, that is standard operating principle when we deal
with suspended devices. If the device thinks they need to resume, they
will do the runtime resume, check the status and sleep if not
applicable. Since we have set the parents correctly, any resume
operation for slaves would wake master up as well...

I do not see a need for intel driver to resume slave devices here, or
did I miss something?
