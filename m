FYI, Bean already askes me privately and here was my answer. Feel free
to comment.

I'm not sure we are synced on this issue, because it is clearly
not addressed in your patchset.

Quoting Richard, the ubifs log uses a fixed range of LEBs. It replays
them upon mount and checks whether they are empty, new or outdated refs
it assumes that interrupted erase got detecred by UBI and such a LEB
will just contain 0xFF bytes. Rewriting the page before erase basically
fails this assumption.

For JFFS2, the problem is the clean marker. You cannot destroy the
payload while keeping the clean marker which says "this block is fine
and contain data".

Also, if you destroy the clean marker, you need to take care of not
turning the block being discovered as "bad" at reboot time if a power
cut happens before the erasure.

All of this is not impossible but:
- we need to write specific code for each user
- we don't want to create more problems that we already have

I cannot give you more details because this is not something that I
master. Ask Richard directly if you need more details on this.
