I fully understand your point and I agree with it.

If I recall correctly, my point in the earlier review phase was that I
wanted the driver to be nicely split into a clock provider part and
into a mmc host driver part. I also raised the point of using
devm_clk_hw_register() rather than the deprecated devm_clk_register().
I still think this makes sense.

That said, perhaps a reasonable split could be to have two separate
c-files (one for clock provider and one for mmc host), but both in the
mmc subsystem.

Kind regards
Uffe
