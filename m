Hmm. I am likely missing something really important here. We have two
problems at hand:
1) RT will become broken as soon as this new RCU functionality which
requires an allocation from inside of raw_spinlock hits the RT tree
2) lockdep splats which are telling us that early because of the
raw_spinlock-> spin_lock dependency.

1) can be handled by handled by the bailing out whenever we have to use
zone->lock inside the buddy allocator - essentially even more strict
NOWAIT semantic than we have for RT tree - proposed (pseudo) patch is
trying to describe that.

2) would become a false positive if 1) is in place, right? RT wouldn't
do the illegal nesting and !RT would just work fine because
GFP_RT_NOWAIT would be simply GFP_NOWAIT & ~__GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM.
Why should we limit the functionality of the allocator for something
that is not a real problem?

That would require changing NOWAIT/ATOMIC allocations semantic quite
drastically for !RT kernels as well. I am not sure this is something we
can do. Or maybe I am just missing your point.
