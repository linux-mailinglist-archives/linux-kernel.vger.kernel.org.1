Do you read Jane Austen at all?

   "I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said
   Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.
   I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested
   in their concerns, as I often see done."

   "My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument
   in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.  They
   have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the
   same expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my
   own fault--because I will not take the trouble of practising."
