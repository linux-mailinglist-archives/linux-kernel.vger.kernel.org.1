Because it is easily 3 separate h/w components (nodes) that have a
link to the connector.

The connector was designed pretty much before there was any TypeC
support in the kernel. Bindings shouldn't be designed around the
*current* needs of a particular OS.

The simplest case for the connector would be:

usb@1234 {
  compatible = "vendor,some-usb-2and3-with-typec-controller";
  ...
  connector {
    compatible = "usb-type-c-connector";
    /* No ports! */
  };

In this case, the h/w for
"vendor,some-usb-2and3-with-typec-controller" can handle everything
for the connector. Doesn't need anything for alt modes because either
it is not supported or there's only one possible source.

Either you hard-code things in DT with "generic", low-level binding or
you hard-code things in a driver. Or maybe in your case, things are
hard-coded in the EC? But most platforms don't have that.

I'm pretty sure we have cases where the alt mode is HDMI. Maybe
there's not yet been a case of multiple alt modes til now. So now the
binding needs to be extended.

Well, all bindings are a balancing act of being flexible enough vs.
high-level enough to be stable. What I need is something that's going
to work for everyone, not just CrOS. Adding a new property at time is
death by 1000 cuts and usually a sign of someone only fixing their own
immediate problem.
