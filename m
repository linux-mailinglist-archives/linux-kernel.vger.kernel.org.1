After wakeup the _baseline_ for loadavg seemed to be the last value before suspend,
not 0. The 7 then was the base loadavg for a _mostly idle machine_ (just reading
mail etc.), i.e. it never went below said baseline again, no matter the
_actual_ load.

Here's an image: https://imgur.com/a/kd2stqO

Before 02:00 last night the load was ~7 (compiled something), then all processes
were terminated and the machine was suspended. After wakeup the machine was mostly
idle (9am..11am), yet measured loadavg continued with the same value as before.
I didn't notice this right away since my CPU meter on the desktop didn't show any
*actual* activity (because there was none). The spike at ~11am is the revert/reboot.
After that loadavg became normal again, i.e. representative of the actual load,
even after suspend/resume cycles.
I suspend/resume every night and the only thing that changed recently was this
patch, so.. :)
