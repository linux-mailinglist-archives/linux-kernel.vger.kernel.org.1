Given that this is a PCI regression, I guess the PCI maintainers
are the likely victims. Adding Bjorn and Lorenzo to the list in
addition to Rob.

You can find the relevant people by looking at the MAINTAINERS
file.

Hmmm. It seems that the original commit (d84c572d) considered that
root_bus_nr was always zero, while it may not have been.

Rob, Lorenzo: do you guys have any idea what is going on here?

Thanks,

         M.
