Until we get some alignment between binutils and the LLVM's integrated
assembler, the latter will be officially unsupported by the kernel. It's
just insane to maintain different options for architecture extensions,
e.g. memtag vs mte, armv8.4-a vs tlb-rmi. Even worse, I think you can't
add some .arch_extension in binutils without bumping the .arch version.
So maybe ".arch_extension tlb-rmi" works for the integrated assembler
but, if such option is added to binutils, it would require ".arch
armv8.4-a" as well.

So, please sort it out guys, collaborate between yourselves when
inventing architecture mnemonics so that you are aligned.

We make take the occasional patch to fix the integrated assembler if
it's not intrusive but at some point we may say it's just not supported
and reject the fix. We have a hard line on the compiler not generating
newer than ARMv8.0 instructions (unless they are in the NOP/HINT space),
so we limit newer instructions to (inline) asm. That's why -march
doesn't work, it needs to be -Wa,-march.
