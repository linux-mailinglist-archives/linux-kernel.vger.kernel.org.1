I agree it is *the* right this to do!

Looking at it, the move of existing types first and then adding the new
type

The rest of the world would do using the real controller device. For
example the soundwire controller on Qualcomm devices is enumerated as a
DT device and is using these...

If Intel had a standalone controller or enumerated as individual
functions, it would have been a PCI device and would manage as such
