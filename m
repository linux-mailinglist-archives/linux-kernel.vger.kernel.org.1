+Automated DAMON-based Memory Operations
+---------------------------------------
+
+Though `Manual Program Optimization` works well in many cases and DAMON can
+help it, modifying the source code is not a good option in many cases.  First
+of all, the source code could be too old or unavailable.  And, many workloads
+will have complex data access patterns that even hard to distinguish hot memory
+objects and cold memory objects with the human eye.  Finding the mapping from
+the visualized access pattern to the source code and injecting the hinting
+system calls inside the code will also be quite challenging.
+
+By using DAMON-based operation schemes (DAMOS) via ``damo schemes``, you will
+be able to easily optimize your workload in such a case.  Our example schemes
+called 'efficient THP' and 'proactive reclamation' achieved significant speedup
+and memory space saves against 25 realistic workloads [2]_, [3]_.
+
+That said, note that you need careful tune of the schemes (e.g., target region
+size and age) and monitoring attributes for the successful use of this
+approach.  Because the optimal values of the parameters will be dependent on
+each system and workload, misconfiguring the parameters could result in worse
+memory management.
+
+For the tuning, you could measure the performance metrics such as IPC, TLB
+misses, and swap in/out events and adjusts the parameters based on their
+changes.  The total number and the total size of the regions that each scheme
+is applied, which are provided via the debugfs interface and the programming
+interface can also be useful.  Writing a program automating this optimal
+parameter could be an option.

 Future Plans
 ============
 
-DAMON is still on its first stage.  Below plans are still under development.
-
-
-Automate Data Access Monitoring-based Memory Operation Schemes Execution
-========================================================================
-
-The ultimate goal of DAMON is being used as a building block of the data access
-pattern aware kernel memory management subsystem optimization.  However, as
-always, some users having very special workloads will want to do their
-optimization.  DAMON will automate most of the tasks for such manual
-optimizations soon.  Users will be required to only describe what kind of data
-access pattern-based operation schemes they want in a simple form.
-
-By applying a very simple scheme for THP promotion/demotion with a prototype
-implementation, DAMON reduced 60% of THP memory footprint overhead while
-preserving 50% of the THP performance benefit.  The detailed results can be
-seen on an external web page [1]_.
-
-Several RFC patchsets for this plan are available [2]_.

+DAMON-based Operation Schemes
+-----------------------------
+
+The ``schemes`` subcommand allows users to do DAMON-based memory management
+optimizations in a few seconds.  Similar to ``record``, it receives monitoring
+attributes and target.  However, in addition to those, ``schemes`` receives
+data access pattern-based memory operation schemes, which describes what memory
+operation action should be applied to memory regions showing specific data
+access pattern.  Then, it starts the data access monitoring and automatically
+applies the schemes to the targets.
+
+The operation schemes should be saved in a text file in below format and passed
+to ``schemes`` subcommand via ``--schemes`` option. ::
+
+    min-size max-size min-acc max-acc min-age max-age action
+
+The format also supports comments, several units for size and age of regions,
+and human readable action names.  Currently supported operation actions are
+``willneed``, ``cold``, ``pageout``, ``hugepage`` and ``nohugepage``.  Each of
+the actions works same to the madvise() system call hints having the name.
+Please also note that the range is inclusive (closed interval), and ``0`` for
+max values means infinite. Below example schemes are possible. ::
+
+    # format is:
+    # <min/max size> <min/max frequency (0-99)> <min/max age> <action>
+    #
+    # B/K/M/G/T for Bytes/KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB
+    # us/ms/s/m/h/d for micro-seconds/milli-seconds/seconds/minutes/hours/days
+    # 'null' means zero for size and age.
+
+    # if a region keeps a high access frequency for >=100ms, put the region on
+    # the head of the LRU list (call madvise() with MADV_WILLNEED).
+    null    null    80      null    100ms   0s      willneed

+    # if a region keeps a low access frequency at least 200ms and at most one
+    # hour, put the region on the tail of the LRU list (call madvise() with
+    # MADV_COLD).

+    # if a region keeps a very low access frequency for >=1 minute, swap
+    # out the region immediately (call madvise() with MADV_PAGEOUT).
+    0B      null    0       10      60s     0s pageout

+    # if a region of a size >=2MiB keeps a very high access frequency for

+    # MADV_HUGEPAGE).
+    2M      null    90      99      100ms   0s hugepage

+    # If a region of a size >=2MiB keeps small access frequency for >=100ms,

+    2M      null    0       25      100ms   0s nohugepage
+
+For example, you can make a running process named 'foo' to use huge pages for
+memory regions keeping 2MB or larger size and having very high access frequency
+for at least 100 milliseconds using below commands::

+Schemes
+-------
+
+For usual DAMON-based data access aware memory management optimizations, users
+would simply want the system to apply a memory management action to a memory
+region of a specific size having a specific access frequency for a specific
+time.  DAMON receives such formalized operation schemes from the user and
+applies those to the target processes.  It also counts the total number and
+size of regions that each scheme is applied.  This statistics can be used for
+online analysis or tuning of the schemes.
+
+Users can get and set the schemes by reading from and writing to ``schemes``
+debugfs file.  Reading the file also shows the statistics of each scheme.  To
+the file, each of the schemes should be represented in each line in below form:
+
+    min-size max-size min-acc max-acc min-age max-age action
+
+Note that the ranges are closed interval.  Bytes for the size of regions
+(``min-size`` and ``max-size``), number of monitored accesses per aggregate
+interval for access frequency (``min-acc`` and ``max-acc``), number of
+aggregate intervals for the age of regions (``min-age`` and ``max-age``), and a
+predefined integer for memory management actions should be used.  The supported
+numbers and their
+meanings are as below.
+
+ - 0: Call ``madvise()`` for the region with ``MADV_WILLNEED``
+ - 1: Call ``madvise()`` for the region with ``MADV_COLD``
+ - 2: Call ``madvise()`` for the region with ``MADV_PAGEOUT``
+ - 3: Call ``madvise()`` for the region with ``MADV_HUGEPAGE``
+ - 4: Call ``madvise()`` for the region with ``MADV_NOHUGEPAGE``
+ - 5: Do nothing but count the statistics
+
+You can disable schemes by simply writing an empty string to the file.  For
+example, below commands applies a scheme saying "If a memory region >=4KiB is
+showing <=5 accesses per aggregate interval (0 5) for >=5 aggregate interval (5
+0), page out the region (2)", check the entered scheme again, and finally
+remove the scheme. ::
+
+    # cd <debugfs>/damon
+    # echo "4096 0 0 5 5 0 2" > schemes
+    # cat schemes
+    4096 0 0 5 5 0 2 0 0
+    # echo > schemes
+
+The last two integers in the 4th line of above example is the total number and
+the total size of the regions that the scheme is applied.

 Turning On/Off
 --------------
 
-Setting the attributes as described above doesn't incur effect unless you
-explicitly start the monitoring.  You can start, stop, and check the current
-status of the monitoring by writing to and reading from the ``monitor_on``
-file.  Writing ``on`` to the file make DAMON start monitoring of the target
-processes with the attributes.  Recording will also start if requested before.
-Writing ``off`` to the file stops those.  DAMON also stops if every target
-process is terminated.  Below example commands turn on, off, and check the
-status of DAMON::
