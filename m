I'm perfectly fine having the name in both the BEGIN and END tags.
It has a nice LaTeX twist to it ;-).

I have queued John's PDC work in irq/irqchip-5.9, which I will get
into -next over the weekend. Feel free to post a patch reworking
his last patch, which will give a very nice overview of what we gain.
