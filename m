Hi Johannes,

When I used PSI to monitor memory pressure, I found there's the same
behavoir in PSI that /proc/pressure/{memroy, IO} can be very large due
to some limited cgroups rather the machine capacity.
Should we separate /proc/pressure/XXX from /sys/fs/cgroup/XXX.pressure
as well ? Then /proc/pressure/XXX only indicate the pressure due to
machine capacity and /sys/fs/cgroup/XXX.presssure show the pressure
throughout the cgroup tree.

Besides that, there's another difference between /proc/pressure/XXX
and /sys/fs/cgroup/XXX.pressure, which is when you disable the psi
(i.e. psi=n) /proc/pressure/ will disapear but
/sys/fs/cgroup/XXX.pressure still exist.  If we separate them, this
difference will be reasonable.
