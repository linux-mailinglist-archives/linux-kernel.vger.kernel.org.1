Thanks for reviewing, Joel :)

The decision was made that we need to support kfree_rcu() from "real atomic contexts",
to align with how it used to be before. We can go and just convert our local locks
to the spinlock_t variant but that was not Paul goal, it can be that some users need
kfree_rcu() for raw atomics.

Sounds like that. Apart of that, it might turn out soon that we or somebody
else will rise a question one more time about something GFP_RAW or GFP_NOLOCKS.
So who knows..

We discussed it several times, the conclusion was that we need to support 
kfree_rcu() from raw contexts. At least that was a clear signal from Paul 
to me. I think, if we obtain the preemtable(), so it becomes versatile, we
can drop the patch that is in question later on in the future.
