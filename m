"dma-coherent" already encapsulates the shareability. To claim coherency 
you need to be able to access memory with inner shareable inner-outer 
write back attributes, because that's how regular kernel memory is 
mapped. If you don't claim coherency, then you should be using 
non-cacheable (and thus implicitly outer shareable) attributes, because 
there may still be cacheable aliases hanging around and if you 
inadvertently snoop those instead of going direct to DRAM as everything 
else expects, you're going to have a bad time.

Essentially, Linux only uses two sets of memory attributes for DMA 
memory, so any perceived need for more than that is already something 
sufficiently esoteric that it probably doesn't need a generic binding. 
I'm aware that it's against type for me to be arguing Linux details in a 
DT binding, but I checked the TRMs for some of these devices and they 
essentially say "you don't program the hardware directly, you use the 
Linux driver we give you", so it seems like this binding is specifically 
intended never to be consumed by anything else.

IMO if this is like PL330 where you just stick some raw AXI attributes 
in a register and that's what goes out on transactions then it's not 
really part of the platform description anyway, it's just driver policy. 
If folks want to tweak the driver's behaviour for secret SoC-specific 
performance optimisation, then give them some module parameters or a 
sysfs interface. I'm assuming this has to be purely a performance thing, 
because I can't see how two different integrations could reasonably 
depend on different baseline attributes for correctness, and even if 
they did then you'd be able to determine that from the compatible 
strings, because they would be different, because those integrations 
would be fundamentally *not* compatible with each other.

Robin.
