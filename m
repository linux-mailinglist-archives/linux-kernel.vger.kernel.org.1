^^ this trick...

+	union {
+		/* bit 0: 0 = mods, 1 = sites */
+		unsigned long type;
+		struct static_call_mod *mods;
+		struct static_call_site *sites;
+	};

If that isn't a trick, I don't know ;-)

That's just how the code was; it treated vmlinux as the NULL module, and
as such needed a static_call_mod allocated to host the static_call_sites
pointer.

That is, the static_call_key has a single linked list pointer to
static_call_mod, and every module has an entry on that list with a
pointer to their sites. Very simple and straight forward.

Except it requires an allocation to set up, which is a pain is you want
it initialized very early.
