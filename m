Moving up to 4.6.4 wouldn't actually help with this though would it?

Also I have 4.6.3 compilers already built, I don't really have time to
rebuild them for 4.6.4.

The kernel has a top-level minimum version, which I'm not in charge of, see:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/changes.html?highlight=gcc


There were discussions about making 4.8 the minimum, but I'm not sure
where they got to.

So like this?
