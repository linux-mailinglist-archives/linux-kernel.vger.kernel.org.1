I just had a look.

"irqchip/gic-v3: Enable arch specific IPI as pseudo NMI" is still done
the wrong way, I'm afraid. You directly poke into the GIC configuration,
which isn't acceptable, as you leave the rest of the kernel completely
unaware that this is a NMI. You should make the interrupt a NMI as it
is being configured in gic_smp_init(), calling request_nmi() at this 
stage.

No. SGIs are already pretty much all allocated for the kernel's internal
needs and once we allocate an additional one for this KGDB feature,
we're out of non-secure SGIs. We could start a multiplexing scheme to
overcome this, but the kernel already has plenty of other mechanisms
for internal communication. After all, why would you need anything more
than smp_call_function()?

The single use case I can imagine is that you'd want to signal a CPU
that isn't running Linux. This would require a lot more work than
just an interrupt, and is out of scope for the time being.

What I would like is for the arch code to request these interrupts as
normal interrupts, for which there is one problem to solve: how do you
find out about the Linux IRQ number for a given IPI. Or rather, how
do you get rid of the requirement to have IPI numbers at all and just
say "give me a per-cpu interrupt that I can use as an IPI, and by the
way here's the handler you can call".

And I insist: this is only for the arch code. Nothing else.

Well, SGIs are not architecture agnostic. They are fundamentally part of
the GIC architecture, which only exists for the two ARM architectures.

SGIs are not a general purpose mechanism. IPIs are, and we have services
on top of IPIs, such as invoking a function on a remote CPU. What else
do you need?

Thanks,
