Hi Greg,

We created a 'driver_override' api for dfl bus, and a driver for
userspace I/O access for dfl devices.

Some new comments inline.

I searched the previous patches, it seems the main issue is the user
could unbind the vfio-pci for a device and bind it to another kernel
driver, while its iommu group is still being used by vfio for other
devices in the same group, then the integrity of the group is
compromised. The conclusion is the user should be responsible for the
correct operation of bind/unbind/driver_override/new_id ...

In this patchset, we use the driver_override for UIO case, I think the
issue doesn't impact it, is it?

We are not going to match driver for every dfl device by user assignment.
We are developing generic kernel drivers for them, e.g. dfl-n3000-nios,
dfl-emif, as you can see in recent patches. They follows the generic
id_table matching.

We use the driver_override for UIO case. Similar to what you've mentioned,
FPGA users develop their own hardware components on FPGA, so they need to
run diagnostic tools for white-box test.
They also need to support some hardware designed for special purposes
and does not fit into one of the standard kernel subsystems.

The FPGA users are the developer of some hardware component, they have the
knowledge of the new dfl devices. So the driver_override give the option
to the users for driver assignment.

For these purposes, is it OK we use the driver_override?


Thanks,
Yilun
