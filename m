tbh, I'm not completely sure offhand what gives surfaceflinger
permission to set itself SCHED_FIFO

(But on CrOS there are a few more pieces to the puzzle)

I don't really like the naming convention approach.. what is to stop
some unrelated process to name it's thread the same thing to get a
SCHED_FIFO boost..

But we can stick with my idea to expose the thread id as a read-only
CRTC property, for userspace to find the things to call
sched_setscheduler() on.  If for whatever reason the drm master is not
privileged (or is running in a sandbox, etc), a small helper that has
the necessary permissions could open the drm device to find the CRTC
thread-ids and call sched_setscheduler()..
