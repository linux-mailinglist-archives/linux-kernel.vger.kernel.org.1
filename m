Subject: [PATCH V2] mm/vmstat: Add events for THP migration without split
Date:   Thu,  4 Jun 2020 09:30:45 +0530
Message-Id: <1591243245-23052-1-git-send-email-anshuman.khandual@arm.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add the following new VM events which will help in validating THP migration
without split. Statistics reported through these new events will help in
performance debugging.

1. THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS
2. THP_MIGRATION_FAILURE

THP_MIGRATION_FAILURE in particular represents an event when a THP could
not be migrated as a single entity following an allocation failure and
ended up getting split into constituent normal pages before being retried.
This event, along with PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS and PGMIGRATE_FAIL will help in
quantifying and analyzing THP migration events including both success and
failure cases.

+Quantifying Migration
+=====================
+Following events can be used to quantify page migration.

+- PGMIGRATE_FAIL
+- THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS
+- THP_MIGRATION_FAILURE
