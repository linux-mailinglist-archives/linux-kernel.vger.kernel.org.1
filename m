The latest version of the ARM architecture reference manual may say
that, but earlier versions say different things. The latest reference
manual does not apply to earlier architectures, so if you're writing
code to cover multiple different architectures, you must have an
understanding of each of those architectures.

So, from the code:

	ARM:   xxxx 0111 1111 xxxx xxxx xxxx 1111 xxxx

From DDI0100E:

3.13.1 Undefined instruction space
       Instructions with the following opcodes are undefined
       instruction space:

       opcode[27:25] = 0b011
       opcode[4] = 1

       31 28 27 26 25 24                                     5 4 3     0
       cond  0  1  1  x  x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x 1 x x x x

So, in this version of the architecture, undefined instructions may
be conditional - and indeed that used to be the case.  The condition
code was always respected, and cond=1111 meant "never" (NV).

Hence, trapping them if the condition code is not 1110 (AL) is
entirely reasonable, legal and safe.  If an ARM CPU defines an
instruction coding that matches the above, then it won't take the
undefined instruction trap, and we'll never see it.

Now, as for UDF usage in the kernel, it may be quite correct that we
always use the AL condition code for them, but it would be very odd
for there to be an instruction implemented with a different (non-NV)
condition code that can't also have it's AL condition code encoding.
You could never execute such an instruction unconditionally.
