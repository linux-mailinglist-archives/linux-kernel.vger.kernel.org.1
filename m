Giving the timer a higher priority doesn't solve anything, really.
It just papers over the fact that you are not using threaded interrupts.
You also don't explain how you plan to change the scheduler and the
whole locking infrastructure to cope with nesting interrupts in the
general case.

I would suggest you use PREEMPT-RT, where all interrupts are threaded
and thus preemptable.
