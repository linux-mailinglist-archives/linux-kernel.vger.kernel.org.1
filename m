I'm sorry, but what patches are we talking about?

I just went to gdb to check again that I'm not crazy, and the scenario
you were worried about seems to work just fine:

134			asm volatile ("mov %%gs:(%%rcx), %%rax" : : "c" (offset) : "rax");
(gdb) p printme()
Hi!
$1 = void
(gdb)

Again, please point me to a specific user we break.
