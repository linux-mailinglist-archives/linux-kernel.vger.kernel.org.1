That's a little tricky, since I don't understand what the test is trying 
to say.

For example, you could change the exists clause to omit "/\ 1:r1=1".  
Maybe that's not a meaningful thing to do... but then it could be 
satisfied simply by having P1 run to completion before P0 starts.

Or you could leave the exists clause as it is and remove the smp_mb() 
from P0.  As you said, that version of the test would also fail since P0 
could then reorder its two writes.

Yes, it's quite correct that because of the control dependency, P1 
cannot write mod_data before it reads the value of len.
