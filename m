I guess we could handle fences by just IPIing over there and executing the
fence?  Probably not worth the effort, though, as if you have an issue that's
showing up close enough to a fence that you can't just probe somewhere nearby
then you're probably going to disrupt things too much to learn anything.  I'd
assume that AMOs are also too much of a headache to emulate, as moving them to
a different hart would allow for different orderings that may break things.

I suppose the tricker issue is that inserting a probe in the middle of a LR/SC
sequence will result in a loss of forward progress (or maybe even incorrect
behavior, if you mess up a pairing), as there are fairly heavyweight
restrictions on what you're allowed to do inside there.  I don't see any
mechanism for handling this, maybe we need to build up tables of restricted
regions?  All the LR/SC sequences should be hidden behind macros already, so it
shouldn't be that hard to figure it out.

I only gave the code a quick look, but I don't see any references to LR/SC or
AMO so if you are handling these I guess we at least need a comment :)

Single step is part of the debug spec.  That mostly discusses JTAG debugging,
but there's also some stuff in there related to in-band debugging (at least
watch points and single step, though there may be more).  IIRC you get a
breakpoint exception and then chase around some CSRs to differentiate between
the various reasons, but it's been a while since I've looked at this stuff.

It's all kind of irrelevant, though, as there's no way to get at all this stuff
from supervisor mode.  I don't see any reason we couldn't put together an SBI
extension to access this stuff, but I also don't know anyone who's looked into
doing so.  There are some complexities involved because this state is all
shared between machine mode and debug mode that we'd need to deal with, but I
think we could put something together -- at least for single step those are
fairly straight-forward issues to handle.
