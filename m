This really needs a proper review. Unfortunately
: 24 files changed, 646 insertions(+), 443 deletions(-)
is quite an undertaking to review as well. Especially in a tricky code
which is full of surprises.

I do agree that per memcg locking looks like a nice feature but I do not
see any pressing reason to merge it ASAP. The cover letter doesn't
really describe any pressing usecase that cannot really live without
this being merged.

I am fully aware of my dept to review but I simply cannot find enough
time to sit on it and think it through to have a meaningful feedback at
this moment.

Agreed! This needs much better testing coverage.
