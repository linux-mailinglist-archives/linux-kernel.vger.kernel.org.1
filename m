Thanks for all the references.  So it looks like we should have failed
sooner, if we didn't support those. Hmm...

I thought those were constraints, not output templates?  Oh,
    The asm statement must also use %U<opno> as a placeholder for the
    =E2=80=9Cupdate=E2=80=9D flag in the corresponding load or store instru=
ction.

What? No, surely one may write tests for output operands.  Grepping
for `%L` in gcc/ was less fun than I was hoping.

Yes, perfect, thank you so much!  So it looks like LLVM does not yet
handle %L properly for memory operands.

It's neat to see how this is implemented in GCC (and how many aren't
implemented in LLVM, yikes :( ).  For reference, this is implemented
in PPCAsmPrinter::PrintAsmOperand() and
PPCAsmPrinter::PrintAsmMemoryOperand() in
llvm/lib/Target/PowerPC/PPCAsmPrinter.cpp.  GCC switches first on the
modifier characters, then the operand type. LLVM dispatches on operand
type, then modifier.  When I was looking into LLVM's AsmPrinter class,
I was surprised to see it's basically an assembler that just has
complex logic to just do a bunch of prints, so it makes sense to see
that pattern in GCC literally calling printf.  Not drastically
different than my first toy compiler
https://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2015/05/25/interpreter-compiler-jit/
(looking back at that post now knowing what relocations are, I feel I
should probably add a note that that's a problem that's being solved
there.  Didn't know it at the time).

Some things I don't understand from PPC parlance is the "mode"
(preinc, predec, premodify) and small data operands?

IIUC the bug report correctly, it looks like LLVM is failing for the
__put_user_asm2_goto case for -m32.  A simple reproducer:
https://godbolt.org/z/jBBF9b

void foo(long long in, long long* out) {
asm volatile(
  "stw%X1 %0, %1\n\t"
  "stw%X1 %L0, %L1"
  ::"r"(in), "m"(*out));
}
prints (in GCC):
foo:
  stw 3, 0(5)
  stw 4, 4(5)
  blr
(first time looking at ppc assembler, seems constants and registers
are not as easy to distinguish,
https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/linux/articles/l-ppc/ say "Get
used to it." LOL, ok).
so that's "store word from register 3 into dereference of register 5
plus 0, then store word from register 4 into dereference of register 5
plus 4?"  Guessing the ppc32 abi is ILP32 putting long long's into two
separate registers?
Seems easy to implement in LLVM (short of those modes/small data operands).
