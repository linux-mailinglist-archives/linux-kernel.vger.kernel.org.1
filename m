At this point all interface drivers get unbound (their disconnect 
routines are called).

As far as I know, protecting against these races is the responsibility 
of the USB interface drivers.  They must make sure that their disconnect 
routines block until all outstanding calls to usb_set_interface return 
(in fact, until all outstanding device accesses have finished).

For instance, in the log extract you showed, it's obvious that the 
uvc_start_streaming routine was running after the disconnect routine had 
returned, which looks like a bug in itself: Once the disconnect routine 
returns, the driver is not supposed to try to access the device at all 
because some other driver may now be bound to it.

We can't just call usb_lock_device from within usb_set_interface, 
because usb_set_interface is often called with that lock already held.
