Sure, will do that.

Yes, it is 1:1 with the CPUs. I have tried to keep this aligned with that of
"coresight-etm4x". The same driver handles both. The only reason why this
was separated from the "coresight.txt" is to describe the new configurations
possible (read, TRBE).

That said, I am happy to move this under the CPU, if Mathieu is happy with
the diversion.

Thanks for the review.
