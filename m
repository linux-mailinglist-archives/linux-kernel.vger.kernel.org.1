PG_idle and PG_young are page flags that are used by idle tracking. The
accessed bit I'm thinking of is in the PTE bit and it's the PTE that
is changed by page_referenced() during reclaim. So it's not clear how
adjusting the page bits help avoid page aging problems during reclaim.

Maybe your suggestion was to move NUMA balancing to use the PG_idle and
PG_young bits from idle tracking but I'm not sure what that gains us.
This may be because I did not look too closely at DAMON as for debugging
and analysis, the PMU sounded more suitable.

It's not clear to me how looking at the page or pte bit handling of
DAMON helps us reduce the scanning cost of numa balancing. There may
be some benefit in splitting the address space and rescanning sections
that were referenced but it has similar pitfalls to simply tracking the
highest/lowest address that trapped a NUMA hinting fault.
