If I say it's a big deal for me, will you remove the bloody thing?

Mentioning EMODPE is a distraction for this patch.  It's a big
distraction because it makes it sound like it is some kind of *peer* of
mmap()/mprotect().  It's not.  It's subservient to x86 paging
protections and thus *IRRELEVANT* for this unless you care about the
intricacies of writing enclaves.

It's a big deal to me.

Also, I've tried to give this feedback previously, but the paging
permissions are also essentially irrelevant.

> Also, should there be commas, i.e. ", or requested the enclave by

I'd just say this:

	It is also stashed off and then later compared with enclave PTEs
	to ensure that any future mmap()/mprotect() operations are
	consistent with the earlier declared permissions.

Yours was starting to look pretty run on.

This is going off into the SGX weeds again.

We don't need to justify the ABI for an ioctl() introduced in a
different patch in *THIS* patch.  Just remove this, please.

That sounds vaguely relevant, although I'm not sure what permission
projection is.  You use that terminology over and over, so you probably
need to define it.

I don't think this is relevant.

I've given this feedback before.  Please don't use "higher" and "lower"
permissions.  "Stronger/weaker" is my preferred terminology.

You also don't have to *NAME* the functions.  If I want to know where a
structure field is, grep is a better way to find that.

Does this lose any meaning if we just say:

	This information will be to ensure that enclave PTEs will not be
	created with permissions weaker than the source data

?
