I agree, especially because this is starting to look a lot more like an
allocation call. And I think it would be appropriate for the kernel to
try approximately as hard to provide these 1GB pages, as it would to
allocate normal memory to a process.

In fact, for a moment I thought, why not go all the way and make this
actually be a true allocation? However, given that we still have
operations that require page splitting, with no good way to call back
user space to notify it that its "allocated" huge pages are being split,
that fails. But it's still pretty close.

Probably either an MADV_* flag or a new syscall would work fine. But
given that this seems like a pretty distinct new capability, one with
options and man page documentation and possibly future flags itself, I'd
lean toward making it its own new syscall, maybe:

     compact_huge_pages(nbytes or npages, flags /* page size, etc */);

...thus leaving madvise() and it's remaining flags still available, to
further refine things.
