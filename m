If we fail to allocate from cluster, "scan_base" and "offset" will not
be overridden.  And "cluster_next" or "cluster_next_cpu" may be changed
in swap_do_scheduled_discard(), because the lock is released and
re-acquired there.

The code may not have much value.  And you may think that it's better to
remove it.  But that should be in another patch.

Oops.  I misunderstood "ALIGN()" here.  Yes.  we should use ALIGN_DOWN()
instead.  Thanks for pointing this out!

Thanks for your review!  It really help me to improve the quality of the
patch.  Can I add your "Reviewed-by" in the next version?
