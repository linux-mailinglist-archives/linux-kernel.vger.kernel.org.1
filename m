I will note that I did continue to dig into the delays, actually.  I
haven't fully resolved all of them, but I'm fairly sure that most of
them are actually inefficiencies in the SPI driver on my platform,
which seems to have a lot of overhead in starting a new transfer.
I'll work on fixing that, but in any case we should still do the async
probe because it's very safe and gives a perf boost.  Why do I say
it's safe?

1. It's not like our probe order was defined by anything anyway.  When
we probe is at the whim of when the SPI controller probes and that can
be any time.

2. If someone needs to access the TPM from another driver then they
have to handle the fact that it might not have probed yet anyway
because perhaps the SPI controller hasn't probed yet.

3. There may be other drivers probing at the same time as us anyway
because _they_ used async probe.

While I won't say that it's impossible to tickle a bug by turning on
async probe, I would assert that in almost all cases the bug was
already there and needed to be fixed anyway.  ;-)
