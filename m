Good point, I had forgotten about LPAE. Thanks for pointing it out.

Agreed, we need to add the check for proper return value then and
definitely document it very clearly as we are trying to standardise
a call to vendor SiP FID space of SMCCC.

I expect so and this comes as shmem property from DT already. We are
just passing the value obtained from there as is. This is just to help
TFA or the firmware to identify the specific channel/shmem as SMC/HVC
otherwise has no way to do so.

Yes, but we definitely can't rely on such mechanism in the kernel. It is
more a platform choice as they run different bootloaders.
