As a crazy idea: is it possible to employ objtool (linker script?) to
rewrite all coverage calls to nops in the noinstr section? Or relocate
to nop function?
What we are trying to do is very static, it _should_ have been done
during build. We don't have means in existing _compilers_ to do this,
but maybe we could do it elsewhere during build?...
