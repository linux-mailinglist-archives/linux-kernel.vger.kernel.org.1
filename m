To me the dev_name() usage seems fine. Maybe David has some real reason
to change this though?

In general I don't think userspace cares what the SPMI device name is,
i.e. the device name isn't used for dev nodes because SPMI doesn't
support ioctls or read/write APIs on the bus. That could be a nice
feature addition though, to support something like i2c-dev.

Changing it so that regmap debugfs is less likely to collide looks
weird. It doesn't actually collide anyway, so it seems like we're adding
spmi prefix to make it easier to find in debugfs?
