I think this proposal still has problems with the directionality of the call.

The arm-smmu-impl.o calls to arm-smmu-qcom.o which calls qcom_scm.o
So if qcom_scm.o is part of a module, the calling code in
arm-smmu-qcom.o also needs to be a module, which means CONFIG_ARM_SMMU
needs to be a module.

I know you said the arm-smmu driver doesn't care about SoC details,
but the trouble is that currently the arm-smmu driver does directly
call the qcom-scm code. So it is a real dependency. However, if
QCOM_SCM is not configured, it calls stubs and that's ok.  In that
way, the "depends on QCOM_SCM || !QCOM_SCM" line actually makes sense.
It looks terrible because we're used to boolean logic, but it's
ternary.

Maybe can have the ARM_SMMU_QCOM_IMPL approach you suggest above, but
that just holds the issue out at arms length, because we're still
going to need to have:
  depends on ARM_SMMU_QCOM_IMPL || !ARM_SMMU_QCOM_IMPL
in the ARM_SMMU definition, which I suspect you're wanting to avoid.

Otherwise the only thing I can think of is a deeper reworking of the
arm-smmu-impl code so that the arm-smmu-qcom code probes itself and
registers its hooks with the arm-smmu core.
That way the arm-smmu driver would not directly call any SoC specific
code (and thus have no dependencies outward). But it's probably a fair
amount of churn vs the extra depends string.
