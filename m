So adding the old bit back for compatibility looks good, thanks.

Then we have to be very careful when adding and reviewing new
interface introducing, should not leave one which might be used
in the future.

In fact, RECLAIM_ZONE is not completely useless. At least, when the old
bit 0 is set, it may enter into node_reclaim() in get_page_from_freelist(),
that makes it like a switch.

get_page_from_freelist {

	...
                        if (node_reclaim_mode == 0 ||                                                                                             
                            !zone_allows_reclaim(ac->preferred_zoneref->zone, zone))
                                continue;
	...
}
