I have looked into this in the past, both for crc32(c) and crc-t10dif,
both of which use a horrid method of wrapping a shash into a library
API. This was before we had static calls, though, and this work kind
of stalled on that. It should be straight-forward to redefine the
crc32c() library function as a static call, and have an optimized
module (or builtin) perform the [conditional] static call update at
module_init() time. The only missing piece is autoloading such
modules, which is tricky with softdeps if the dependency is from the
core kernel.

Currently, we have many users of crc32(c) in the kernel that go via
the shash (or synchronous ahash) layer to perform crc32c, all of which
would be better served by a library API, given that the hash type is a
compile time constant, and only synchronous calls are made.
