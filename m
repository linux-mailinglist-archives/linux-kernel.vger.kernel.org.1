No problem. get_maintainer (for the proposals) works on paths, not on
topics and I didn't want to leave anybody out.

Ted, if you don't have the time any more to take care of /dev/random,
it's not a shame to hand over maintainership, especially given your
long history of Linux contributions.

Please do seriously consider to hand it over to someone new. This would
be a good opportunity.
