This is also true. I meant by corrupt state e.g. a kernel bug, which
causes uninitalizes pages go the free queue.

I'd rephrase this in kdoc as: "The function deinitializes enclave and
returns -EIO when EPC is lost, while entering to a new power cycle".

Documentation describes only legit behaviour, let's ignore the corrupt
part.

We need to figure out own return value for EADD, but I agree with this.

I would go with -EFAULT as we do when source VMA is no available. Does
this make sense to you?
