See, the tmp.perf/core experimentation is about making it available what
would be just my local tree for wider consumption, what I have in
perf/core is what is non-rebase material, I try to push things there
only after testing and then recording the tests performed as signed
tags, see:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/acme/linux.git/tag/?h=perf-tools-tests-2020-07-17

So if we find something wrong with material made available via my
tmp.perf/core branch, we can go back in time and fix it, to try and have
a more solid bisection base.

It may be confusing (it seems so from how you responded to this thread),
and if it ends up being so confusing, I'll just ditch it and go back to
having just local branches, would be a pity as I'm keen on having a good
bisection history so I'll probably take more time to publish things.

Opinions about this, of course, more than welcome.

Back to this specific case, when sending fixes for things in
tmp.perf/core, please state what is the cset that needs folding into.

Thanks,

- Arnaldo
