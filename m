Yes, we should fix deferred probing.

I'm not saying that the current code is perfect.  I'm saying that the
fix as proposed adds too much cost for everybody who may not care IMO.

There are "class" devices, "type" devices and devices that simply have
no drivers, but the bus type code may still want to touch them during
system-wide suspend/resume.

Modules may still not be loaded when the system is suspended for the
first time etc.
