The assignment of the PPIs is completely implementation defined,
and is not part of the architecture (and certainly not in the
GICv3/v4 spec). SBSA makes some statements as to the way they *could*
be assigned, but that's in no way enforced. This allocation is entirely
controlled by userspace, which would need to configure tell KVM
which PPI to use on a per-VM basis.

You would then need to describe the PPI assignment through firmware
(both DT and ACPI) so that the guest kernel can know what PPI the
hypervisor would be signalling on.

It is also not very future proof should we move to a different
interrupt architecture.

The current state of the architecture doesn't seem to leave much leeway 
in
terms of SW creativity here. You just can't allocate your own ISS 
encoding
without risking a clash with future revisions of the architecture.
It isn't even clear whether the value you put would stick in ESR_EL1
if it isn't a valid value for this CPU (see the definition of 'Reserved'
in the ARM ARM).

Allocating such a syndrome would require from ARM:

- the guarantee that no existing implementation, irrespective of the
   implementer, can cope with the ISS encoding of your choice,

- the written promise in the architecture that some EC/ISS values
   are reserved for SW, and that promise to apply retrospectively.

This is somewhat unlikely to happen.
