If you remembered earlier discussions when this driver was added,
tee-supplicant dependency concern was raised at that time too. But the
response from author [1] was to use a workaround in firmware to
overcome the initialization issue of fTPM driver.

Basically while using upstream OP-TEE, fTPM NV RAM is implemented via
RPMB secure storage [2]. So any fTPM operation dependent on NV RAM may
fail without access to RPMB secure storage.

And during kernel boot, RPMB access isn't available (there were some
prior efforts [3] around this but unfortunately didn't land in
upstream) due to which we need to rely on user mode tee-supplicant for
corresponding access.

So we should only register fTPM device when the underlying
infrastructure is working, which is something this patch-set addresses
via registering fTPM device only when the tee-supplicant is up and
running.

Please see my response above.
