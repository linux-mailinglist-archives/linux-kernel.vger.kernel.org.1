I have tried all the steps that David mentioned and reported back at
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200511174731.GD1961@linux.vnet.ibm.com/t/#u

As a summary, David's steps are still not creating a memoryless/cpuless on
x86 VM. I have tried booting with Numa/non-numa on all the x86 machines that
I could get to.
