True. rq->cpu_capacity_orig could be set early in build_sched_domains(),
before the call to asym_cpu_capacity_level() or within this function.

True.

OK, let's change this for the task scheduler only.

OK, Pelt is task scheduler so it can be changed here as well.

I'm going to create a patch following these ideas.
