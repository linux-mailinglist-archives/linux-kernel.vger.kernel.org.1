When you say "With this function...", I think you are referring to
lruvec_holds_page_lru_lock().  Yes, I appreciate what you're doing
there, making calculations from known-stable data, and taking it no
further than the required comparison; and I think (I don't yet claim
to have reviewed 21/32) what you do with it in relock_page_lruvec*()
is an improvement over what we had there before.

But here I'm talking about using it in isolate_migratepages_block()
in 28/32: in this case, the code before evaluated the new lruvec,
compared against the old, and immediately used the new lruvec if
different; whereas using lruvec_holds_page_lru_lock() makes an
almost (I agree not entirely, and I haven't counted cachelines)
equivalent evaluation, but its results have to thrown away when
it's false, then the new lruvec actually calculated and used.

The same "results thrown away" criticism can be made of
relock_page_lruvec*(), but what was done there before your rewrite
in v18 was no better: they both resort to lock_page_lruvec*(page),
working it all out again from page.  And I'm not suggesting that
be changed, not at this point anyway; but 28/32 looks to me
like a regression from what was done there before 28/32.

I agree it's nicer not to TestClearPageLRU unnecessarily; but if the
occasional unnecessary TestClearPageLRU were really a concern, then
there's a lot of more serious places to worry about - page reclaim
is the great isolator that comes first to my mind.

Your concern and my concern are different, but we are "on the same page".

I've said repeatedly (to Alex) that I am not at ease with this
TestClearPageLRU() technique: he has got it working, reliably, but
I find it hard to reason about.  Perhaps I'm just too used to what
was there before, but clearing PageLRU and removing from LRU while
holding lru_lock seems natural to me; whereas disconnecting them
leaves us on shaky ground, adding comments and warnings about the
peculiar races involved.  And it adds a pair of atomic operations
on each page in pagevec_lru_move_fn(), which were not needed before.

I want us to go ahead with TestClearPageLRU, to get the series into
mmotm and under wider testing.  But if we accept the lock reordering
in 06/32, then it becomes possible to replace those TestClearPageLRUs
by lock_page_memcg()s: which in principle should be cheaper, but that
will have to be measured.
