Recursion is what focuses the mind but I don't think we'd need
recursion for there to be problems.

For example taking a kprobe trap whilst executing the kgdb trap handler
(or vice versa) is already likely to be fragile and is almost certainly
untested on most or all architectures. Further if I understood Peter's
original nudge correctly then, in addition, x86 plans to explicitly
prohibit this anyway.

On other words I think there will only be one blacklist.

Some of the architectures currently have kgdb support but do not have
kprobes...

This sounds like this wouldn't really be a functional change over
what I have proposed. More like augmenting it with a massive symbol
rename (and maybe a little bit of extra code movement in the headers
to give us linux/noinstr.h).

Taking my cues from things like set_fs() I originally decided to keep
away from such a big rename ;-) .

Personally I'm open to a rename. I could write PATCH 4/4 assuming a
rename will come (e.g. different naming for new files and Kconfig
options) and follow that with an automatically generated
rename patch (or patches).


Daniel.
