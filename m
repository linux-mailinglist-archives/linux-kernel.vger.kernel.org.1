Actually, I have this patch in my tree. So, it does not fixes the
issue. Which is weird, actually. I'm planning to look deeper into
this.

I can see your point. But I think, that it is good to not to break
backward- and forward- compatibility. Imagine, that user upgrades
OP-TEE without changing the kernel. Previously it worked well, but new
OP-TEE provides new PTA and kernel refuses to load the optee driver
because driver fails to initialize that PTA.

This is basically what happened with me. Platform that I am using does
not provide any OP-TEE devices so I assumed that I can safely ignore
this feature. But, when I flashed the latest OP-TEE build I got dead
optee driver. This is confusing from a user standpoint. You don't
expect that firmware upgrade to another minor version will break
existing setup. My proposed patch at least prints the warning, so user
would know where to look...

Anyways, if we'll find a proper fix before next code freeze, I'd
prefer to drop this particular patch. But let's keep it as a plan
B. What do you think?
