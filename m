Ah, makes sense.

Thanks! While looking at the code I also saw some other paths that
appeared to be racy, though I haven't worked them out in detail to
confirm that - the locking around the inode and writeback lists is
tricky. What's the best way to follow up on those? Happy to post them
to this same thread after I spend a bit more time looking at the code.

Thanks,
Martijn
