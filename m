0x01 is 1 and is generally treated as boolean true as you know.

So why should a sysfs-interface accept it as valid input and treat it as
false? That's just bad design.

You miss the point; kstrobool accepts "12" today and treats it as true.
You cannot extend such an interface to later accept a larger range than
0 and 1 as you didn't return an error for "12" from the start (as someone
might now rely on "12" being treated as "1").
