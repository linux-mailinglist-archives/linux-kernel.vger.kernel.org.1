INTRODUCTION
============

Cisco ASA firewall appliances use open source software.

Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software, version 9.8
Copyright (c) 1996-2019 by Cisco Systems, Inc.
For licenses and notices for open source software used in this product, 
please visit

The basic configuration of the Cisco ASA 5506-X Firepower firewall was 
completed by a previous IT consultant previously (date unknown), so I 
shall not cover it here. I will cover configuration of the Cisco ASA 
5506-X Firepower firewall from Phase 1 onwards, as described below.

The Cisco ASA 5506-X Firepower firewall costs about SGD$1000 in 
Singapore, with refurbished units costing around SGD$500.

PHASE 1: Basic Configuration of SSL VPN on Cisco ASA 5506-X Firepower 
Firewall
==============================================================================

Reference Guide: Cisco ASA Anyconnect Remote Access VPN

You can download Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client version 
3.1.03103 at the following link.

PHASE 2: Installing 90-day Free Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate on Cisco 
ASA 5506-X Firepower Firewall SSL VPN
============================================================================================================

show flash

Check for asdm-xxx.bin

Go to https://<IP address of Cisco ASA 5506-X firewall>

Install Java Web Start

Install ASDM Launcher

On the Cisco ASDM:

Device IP address / Name: <private IP address of Cisco ASA 5506-X 
firewall>

PHASE 3: Configure LDAP/Active Directory Primary Authentication for 
Cisco ASA 5506-X SSL VPN
============================================================================================

Reference Guide: Configure LDAP Authentication for WebVPN Users
Link: 
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/98625-asa-ldap-authentication.html

dsquery user -samid administrator

Testing LDAP Authentication in Phase 3
======================================

debug ldap 255

test aaa-server authentication LDAP_SRV_GRP host <IP address of AD DC 
server> username administrator password password

Troubleshooting for Phase 3
============================

[1] Troubleshooting LDAP Connections to Active Directory Using Apache 
Directory Studio
Link: 
https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/articles/224/troubleshooting-ldap-connections-to-active-directory-using-apache-directory-studio

[2] Cisco – LDAP AAA Error ‘AAA Server has been removed”
Link: https://www.petenetlive.com/KB/Article/0001271

[3] ASA 9.8, Bridge groups, and LDAP authentication
Link: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Cisco/comments/80qezi/asa_98_bridge_groups_and_ldap_authentication/

In this discussion, a Cisco ASA software bug has been found which 
prevents the Cisco ASA firewall from communicating with the LDAP 
server/Active Directory Domain Controller. To resolve this issue, a 
firmware upgrade is required.


PHASE 4: How to Install Duo 2FA Secondary Authentication for Cisco ASA 
5506-X SSL VPN
=====================================================================================

Follow the Duo Authentication setup instructions at the following link.

Reference Guide: Cisco ASA SSL VPN for Browser and AnyConnect
Link: https://duo.com/docs/ciscoasa-ldap

Then follow the guide below.

Reference Guide: CISCO ASA Enable DNS Lookup Problem
Link: 
https://community.cisco.com/t5/network-security/cisco-asa-enable-dns-lookup-problem/td-p/1764736

conf t

dns domain-lookup Outside

dns server-group DefaultDNS

name-server 8.8.8.8

name-server 8.8.4.4

exit

Phase 5: Upgrade Firmware and ASDM of Cisco ASA 5506-X Firepower 
Firewall
=========================================================================

copy run start

Follow the rest of the instructions at the following link.

Reference Guide: ASA 9.x : Upgrade a Software Image using ASDM or CLI 
Configuration Example
Link: 
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/200142-ASA-9-x-Upgrade-a-Software-Image-using.html

Phase 6: Configure NAT Exemption on the Cisco ASA 5506-X Firewall
=================================================================

Why do we need to configure NAT exemption on the Cisco ASA 5506-X 
Firepower firewall? Because otherwise, the Cisco AnyConnect Secure 
Mobility Client cannot access the remote LAN
behind the Cisco ASA firewall.

access-list NAT-EXEMPT extended permit ip 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 
192.168.168.0 255.255.255.0

object network obj-vpn_ip_address_pool

subnet 192.168.168.0 255.255.255.0

nat (inside_1,outside) source static any any destination static 
obj-vpn_ip_address_pool obj-vpn_ip_address_pool

no access-list SPLIT_TUNNEL standard permit 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

MUST READ ARTICLES FOR PHASE 6
==============================

[1] Quick guide: AnyConnect Client VPN on Cisco ASA 5505
Link: 
https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/smb-technologist/quick-guide-anyconnect-client-vpn-on-cisco-asa-5505/

QUOTE:

"Do not use the same subnet as your inside network. So, if you're using 
192.168.100.0/24 for the inside, use 192.168.104.0/24 for your VPN 
pool."

Link: 
http://networkqna.com/how-to-configure-nat-exemption-in-version-8-3-for-vpn-in-cisco-asa/

Phase 7: Configuring Dynamic DNS (DDNS)
=======================================

The Cisco ASA 5506-X Firepower Firewall does not support Dynamic DNS 
update using the HTTP POST method. The Cisco ASA only supports DDNS 
update using the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) method.

Since the Cisco ASA does not support the HTTP Post method, it CANNOT 
work with NO-IP and DynDNS DDNS service providers.

The following are the results of my research on the Internet:

[01] With its sole reliance on the IETF method, websites such as 
DynDns.org cannot be updated using the ASA, however support has been 
added for HTTPS using port 443.

Link: 
https://www.globalknowledge.com/ca-en/resources/resource-library/articles/implementing-dynamic-dns-on-cisco-ios-router-and-asa/

[02] If you're asking if you can get the ASA5505 to "register" with 
dyndns, the answer is no. Howeve, it appears that someone got a feature 
request added, though, under Cisco BugID CSCsl46782 . (If you don't have 
a Cisco service contract, you can't view the details). However, it looks 
like it has an extremely low priority and I wouldn't expect it to be 
added anytime soon.

Link: 
https://serverfault.com/questions/272825/dyndns-updating-ip-address-via-cisco-asa-5505

PROPOSED WORKAROUND SOLUTION FOR PHASE 7
========================================

I would propose installing Dynamic DNS updater client software on AD DC 
server or any of your office computers which are permanently powered on.

ACTUAL SOLUTION FOR PHASE 7
===========================

Sign up for free No-IP account.

Create hostname teo-en-ming-corp.ddns.net, and point it to public IP 
address of the Cisco ASA firewall.

Install no-ip dynamic update client (duc) in any 24x7 computer behind 
the Cisco ASA firewall.

Create DNS CNAME record sslvpn.teo-en-ming-corp.com and point it to 
teo-en-ming-corp.ddns.net

Phase 8: Synchronizing Users from Active Directory to Duo
=========================================================

Follow the setup instructions at the following link.

Reference Guide: Synchronizing Users from Active Directory
Link: https://duo.com/docs/adsync

dsquery user -samid teoenming
"CN=Turritopsis Dohrnii Teo En 
Ming,OU=Users,OU=Singapore,DC=teo-en-ming-corp,DC=com"

Phase 9: Enrolling Users at Duo
===============================

Reference Guide: Enrolling Users at Duo

Phase 9 is the final phase.
