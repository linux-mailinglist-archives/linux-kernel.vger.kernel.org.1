Oh, that's a good and simple idea.

I'm not sure how that helps? I mean, the use case you have in mind is
somebody reusing a distro/random config and not being able to use
trace_printk, right? If that config has CONFIG_DISABLE_TRACE_PRINTK=y,
then the developer will still need to flip that back.

Note that the option I'm added has default=y (_allow_ trace_printk),
so I don't think default y or default n really matters?
