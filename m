Ok, I understand;

Initial thought was to use watchdog SPI as pseudo NMI; however, as 
pseudo NMIs are only per CPU sources, we were exploring the possibility 
of using an unused ipi (using the work which is done in [1] and [2]  for 
SGIs) as pseudo NMI, which EL3 sends to EL1, on receiving watchdog fiq. 
The pseudo NMI handler would collect required debug information, to help 
indentify the lockup cause. We weren't thinking of communicating any 
information from EL3 fiq handler to EL1.

However, from this discussion, I realize that calling irq handler from
fiq handler, would not be possible. So, the approach looks flawed.

I believe, allowing a non-percpu pseudo NMI is not acceptable to community?

Ok got it; however, I wonder what's the use case of sending
SGI to EL1, from secure world, using ICC_ASGI1R. I thought it
allowed communication between EL1 and EL3; but, looks like I understood 
in wrong.

Ok.

Agree that it might not work for all cases. But, for the cases like, 
some kernel code is stuck after disabling local irqs; pseudo NMI might 
still be able to run and capture stack and other debug info, to help 
detect the cause of lockups.
