Yep. We have a rule that no earlier supported stable release should
have a fix that a more recent stable release does not have. So this
needs to be accepted in 5.4-rt before 4.19-rt can have it. And those
maintainers have been waiting patiently for me to push this ;-)

We don't usually add comments to the commit log for backported patches.

This has been talked about before. Perhaps you should bring up posting
stable RT RC releases into git repositories at the RT microconference
at Plumbers ;-) Especially since the last time I asked about it, people
said it wasn't necessary.
