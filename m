This looks good to me in concept.

Would you expect that I trigger this from libnvdimm sysfs, or any
future users of this functionality to trigger it through their own
subsystem specific mechanisms?

I have a place for it in libvdimm and could specify the activation
method directly as "suspend" vs "live" activation.
