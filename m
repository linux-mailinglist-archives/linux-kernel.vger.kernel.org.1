I trimmed the cc as the mailing lists appear to be blocking this
email because of it.

I dug up the old zinc patch submissions and this wasn't present at
all in the original.  The original zinc code used blkcipher_walk
which unconditinoally does kmap_atomic.

So it's only the SG miter conversion that introduced this change,
which appears to be a simple oversight (I think Ard was working on
latency issues at that time, perhaps he was worried about keeping
preemption off unnecessarily).

---8<---
There is no reason for the chacha20poly1305 SG miter code to use
kmap instead of kmap_atomic as the critical section doesn't sleep
anyway.  So we can simply get rid of the preemptible check and
set SG_MITER_ATOMIC unconditionally.

Even if we need to reenable preemption to lower latency we should
be doing that by interrupting the SG miter walk rather than using
kmap.
