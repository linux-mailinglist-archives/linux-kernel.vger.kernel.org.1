Could you please split this in separate patches rather than having a
single one doing three somewhat related things?

Why can this not be an early_initcall()? As you said, memory_dev_init()
is called much later, after the SMP was initialised.

You could even combine this with validate_bootmem_online_state() in a
single early_initcall() which, after checking, registers the notifier.
