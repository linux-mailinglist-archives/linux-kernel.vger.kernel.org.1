Fair enough!

Also as noted on the other thread, in this case, doing this 64-bit
division the hard way shouldn't be a problem:  The performance test is
finished and nothing else is happening.  So I have to wonder whether it
would be possible to detect this based on some sort of link-time checking,
presumably in conjunction with -O0 to avoid confusing the whitelist with
compiler optimizations.

That would allow use of C-language "/" and "%" while still allowing
gratuitous uses to be questioned.

Hey, I can dream, can't I?  ;-)

							Thanx, Paul
