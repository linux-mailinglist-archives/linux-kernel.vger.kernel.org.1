For that case, what about just "make clean" before copy, then the binary
will be removed?

The idea of UNTESTED/UNRESOLVED (and UNSUPPORTED) came from POSIX standard,
it is expained in dejagnu's manual:

https://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/manual/A-POSIX-Conforming-Test-Framework.html

In this case, user can build the user space binary for the environment but
does't, so I think UNRESOLVED will fit to that case.

So strictly speaking, UNTESTED is just a placeholder which will be implemented
in the future. (hmm, it will be a good chance to write a document for it)

Thank you,
