It could indeed trigger a chain of faults. It's not even other threads,
it could be the same thread in a different function.

This gets complicated if you have to parse the opcode. If you can
single-step, just set PSTATE.TCO for the instruction. But the
single-step machinery gets more complicated, probably interacts badly
with kprobes.

I think the best option is to disable the MTE checks in TCF on an
_unhandled_ kernel fault, report and continue. For the KASAN tests, add
accessors similar to get_user/put_user which are able to handle the
fault and return an error. Such accessors, since they have a fixup
handler, would not lead to the MTE checks being disabled.
