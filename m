If you can't easily fix the alpha issue, you can just mark the driver as
not able to be built there for now.

Pointers to those emails on lore.kernel.org?

iio started in staging, but now that the infrastructure is out of it,
there should not be any reason that new drivers be forced to go into
staging too.  You only want to do it this way if for some reason you can
not get the work done on your own.

What exactly do you mean by this?  Who needs to be a "manager" here?

workqueues are very light, how many sensors and what type of resources
are you referring to here?  And adding a whole new user api is not
exactly "tiny" either :)

That's userspace's issue, right?

Why does that have to be in the kernel?

Again, how many resources are you really saving here with a whole new
framework?

Data to where?

Then it is not needed :)

Then you need to document it really well as to what you are doing here.

But again, please try working with the IIO framework as that is what we
have today.  Any improvements you make to it will help everyone out.

Adding a third way to handle sensor data to the kernel is probably not
going to work well for anyone...
