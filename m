Yes it is not specific to coresight, we are targeting this for all
consumers/clients of SMMU(atleast on SC7180 SoC). We have display 
throwing
NoC/interconnect errors[1] during reboot after SMMU is disabled.
This is also not specific to kexec either as you explained here [2] 
about
a case with display which is exacly what is happening in our system [1].
