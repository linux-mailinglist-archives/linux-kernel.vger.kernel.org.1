OK, let's fill in the issues, then:

1.	Prohibit invoking allocators from raw atomic context, such
	as when holding a raw spinlock.

	o	This would prevent an important cache-locality
		optimization.

2.	Adding a GFP_ flag.

	o	Requires a new level atomic allocation for all preemption
		models, namely, confined to the allocator's lockless
		caches.

3.	Reusing existing GFP_ flags/values/whatever to communicate
	the raw-context information that was to be communicated by
	the new GFP_ flag.

	o	There are existing users of all combinations that might
		be unhappy with a change of semantics.

	o	But Michal is OK with this if usage is restricted to RT.
		Except that this requires #4 below:

4.	Making lockdep forgive acquiring spinlocks while holding
	raw spinlocks, but only in CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y kernels.

	o	This would allow latency degradation and other bad coding
		practices to creep in, per Thomas's recent email.

Again, am I missing anything?

							Thanx, Paul
