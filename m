The current code does encode the direction with src_owner != NULL meaning
device private to system memory and src_owner == NULL meaning system
memory to device private memory. This patch would obviously defeat that
so perhaps a flag could be added to the struct migrate_vma to indicate the
direction but I'm unclear how that makes things less delicate.
Can you expand on what you are worried about?

The issue with invalidations might be better addressed by letting the device
driver handle device private page TLB invalidations when migrating to
system memory and changing migrate_vma_setup() to only invalidate CPU
TLB entries for normal pages being migrated to device private memory.
If a page isn't migrating, it seems inefficient to invalidate those TLB
entries.

Any other suggestions?
