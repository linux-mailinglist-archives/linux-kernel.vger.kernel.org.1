Hmm, we spin in a circle :)

Infact this was my first way of implementing the groups in Venus driver,
you can see it at [1].

 +#define VDBGL(fmt, args...)	pr_debug("VENUSL: " fmt, ##args)
 +#define VDBGM(fmt, args...)	pr_debug("VENUSM: " fmt, ##args)
 +#define VDBGH(fmt, args...)	pr_debug("VENUSH: " fmt, ##args)
 +#define VDBGFW(fmt, args...)	pr_debug("VENUSFW: " fmt, ##args)
