I completely agree with Johannes here.

Not that I object to this use but I think it would be much better to use
it based on actual data. Going along with it right away might become a
future burden to make any changes in this aspect later on due to lack of 
exact reasoning. General rule of thumb for __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL is really
try as hard as it can get without being really disruptive (like OOM
killing something). And your wording didn't really give me that
impression.
