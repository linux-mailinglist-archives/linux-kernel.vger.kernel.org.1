Sure, but also much of the below wasn't stated anywhere in the thread I
got Cc'ed on. All I got was half arsed solutions without an actual
problem statement.

I've never used kfree_rcu(), htf would I know.

Right so on RT just cut out the allocation and unconditionally make it
NULL. Since it needs to deal with GFP_ATOMIC|GFP_NOWARN failing the
allocation anyway.

There was no lockdep splat in the thread.

Well, which actual usage sites are under a raw spinlock? Most of the
ones I could find are not.

Well, that's a fail :-( I tought we were supposed to solve known issues
before shit got merged.

Not only Michal, those patches looked pretty horrid.

Yeah, I know, been there done that, like over a decade ago :-)

I would've written the code like:

	void *mem = NULL;

	...
#ifndef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT
	mem = kmalloc(PAGE_SIZE, GFP_ATOMIC|GFP_NOWAIT);
#endif
	if (!mem)
	  ....

Seems much simpler and doesn't pollute the GFP_ space.

So due to this heat crap I've not slept more than a few hours a night
for the last week, I'm not entirely there, but we already have a bunch
of lockdep magic for this raw nesting stuff.

But yes, we need to avoid abuse, grep for lockdep_off() :-( This
drivers/md/dm-cache-target.c thing is just plain broken. It sorta
'works' on mainline (and even there it can behave badly), but on RT it
will come apart with a bang.

Which isn't actually stated anywhere I suppose ?

Like above, I tend to be with Michal on this, just wrap the actual
allocation in CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT, the code needs to handle a NULL pointer
there anyway.

Uhh, !CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT, the rest is 'fine'.

My preferred solution is 1, if you want to use an allocator, you simply
don't get to play under raw_spinlock_t. And from a quick grep, most
kfree_rcu() users are not under raw_spinlock_t context.

This here sounds like someone who wants to have his cake and eat it too.

I'll try and think about a lockdep annotation that isn't utter crap, but
that's probably next week, I need this heat to end and get a few nights
sleep, I'm an utter wreck atm.
