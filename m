We know how BBML works; the point is that the only thing the Linux IOMMU 
API ever legitimately does that even comes near its scope is putting 
down a block entry over an old table. Crucially, though, we still never 
do that *while the table is live*. In general, callers *cannot* expect 
two overlapping iommu_map() requests to work, because in most cases one 
of the requests will fail, and at best even if both "succeed" there is 
no guarantee of what will actually be mapped afterwards.

That's largely why we don't bother walking down a table entry if we *do* 
find one when mapping a block; the only *valid* way for that to happen 
implies that anything which was previously in that table has already 
been unmapped such that the IOVA could have been reused, so we can just 
go ahead and free it straight away.

And for clearing out a dead table, BBML really doesn't gain us anything:

BBML=0:
	write 0
	TLBI + sync
	write block PTE
	free table


BBML=1:
	write nT block PTE
	TLBI + sync
	write block PTE
	TLBI + sync
	free table
that's *more* work...

BBML=2
	write block PTE
	TLBI + sync
	free table
we save a grand total of one store, woo.


Now we probably will need some degreee of BBML feature awareness for the 
sake of SVA if and when we start using it for CPU pagetables, but I 
still cannot see any need to consider it in io-pgtable.
