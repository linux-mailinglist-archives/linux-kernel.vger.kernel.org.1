Hi Mark,

This would be quite an uncommon case. Generally most instances of a 
given PMU in a SoC would be identical implementations.

And anyway, we should be able to solve that problem in perf tool, as 
long as the PMU device name is fixed. Like what we have for the SMMUv3 
PMU, where the device name contains the device bus address, i.e don't 
use idr for perf drivers device naming....

Thanks,
John
