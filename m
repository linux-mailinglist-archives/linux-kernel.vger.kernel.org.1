Ah, just used the output from get_maintainers.pl.

Ok, Eric. I've tried to do this with the best intentions possible and I
would assume that this is the default assumption everyone would have
after all these years. This type of response is very shocking to me and
I honestly don't know how to respond!

I'm dropping this completely because I'm not going to be accused of
having a hidden agenda! Such an accusation is imho completely out of
line and it is completely unacceptable to treat a peer like this!
