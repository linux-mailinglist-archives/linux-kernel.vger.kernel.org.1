I am not as worried about the high-level macros as I am about the code
that does the bulk of the work, but they should still move as well.
Otherwise, changes involving both the macros and the underlying
implementation are harder than needed.

I don't have any opinion on exactly where in mm the underlying
implementation code should go.  You suggestion of mm/slab_common.c
seems fine to me.  ;-)
