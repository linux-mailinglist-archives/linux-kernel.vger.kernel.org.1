Imagine you have a host with 2 interfaces. 1 is using SLAAC, the other
one it isn't.
On your main routing table you have the default SLAAC route for iface A

Then you're setting a second interface B and you enable forwarding
only on this iface:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/B/forwarding. Changing the sysctl
which call the rt6_purge_dflt_routers
which would delete your default route on iface A, so effectively you
will lose connection via iface A, until the default
entry is added again which would happen because that iface has
accept_ra = 1 and forwarding = 0, but it would take some time.
It feels weird that modifying interface B deletes default route A
which would be added back anyway, but you lose connection on A for
some minutes.

Fair enough, the main issue here is that the behaviour of a host in a
mixed environment is not well defined.
