Subject: [PATCH 00/44] SPMI patches needed by Hikey 970

Hi Greg,

This patch series is part of a work I'm doing in order to be able to support
a HiKey 970 board that I recently got on my hands.

I received some freedback from Mark and from Jonathan on a first
attempt I made to upstream this.

I'm opting to submit it via staging, because I had to start from the
patch that originally added this driver on a 4.9 Kernel tree:

	https://github.com/96boards-hikey/linux/tree/hikey970-v4.9

In order to preserve the original SOB from the driver's author.

The patches following it are on the standard way: one patch per
logical change.

This is part of a bigger work whose goal is to have upstream support
for USB and DRM/KMS on such boards. 

I suspect that, maybe except for the DT part, those 3 specific drivers
are more or less ready to be moved from staging, but the other
drivers that are also part of this attempt aren't ready. Specially the
DRM driver has some bugs that came from the OOT version.

So, my current plan is to submit those drivers to staging for 5.9
and move the ones that are ok out of staging on Kernel 5.10.

Regards,
Mauro.
