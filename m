The idle tracking reads and updates not only PG_idle and PG_young, but also the
accessed bit.  So idle tacking was also required to deal with the interference
of the reclaimer logic and thus it introduced PG_young.  The commit
33c3fc71c8cf ("mm: introduce idle page tracking") explains this as below:

    The Young page flag is used to avoid interference with the memory
    reclaimer.  A page's Young flag is set whenever the Access bit of a page
    table entry pointing to the page is cleared by writing to the bitmap file.
    If page_referenced() is called on a Young page, it will add 1 to its
    return value, therefore concealing the fact that the Access bit was
    cleared.

DAMON adjusts PG_young in similar way to avoid the interference.  DAMON further
adjusts PG_idle so that it does not interfere to page idle tracking mechanism.
I think I made you confused by unnecessarily mentioning PG_idle, sorry.

DAMON allows users to know which address ranges have which access frequency.
Thus, I think DAMON could be used for detection of hot pages, which will be
good migration candidates, instead of the NUMA hinting fault based referenced
pages detection.

The benefits I expect from this change are better accuracy and less overhead.
As we can know not only referenced pages but hot pages, migration will be more
effective.

In terms of the overhead, DAMON allows users to set the upperbound of the
monitoring overhead regardless of the size of the targe address space, unlike
the page scanning based mechanisms.  Thus, the overhead could be reduced,
especially if the target process has large memory footprint.

As I'm not deeply understanding AutoNUMA, I might saying something unrealistic
or missing some important points.
