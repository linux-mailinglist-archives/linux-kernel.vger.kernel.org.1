You need to call put_device() at some point to release the reference
that you acquired by calling of_find_device_by_node(). If you don't
release it, you're leaking the reference and the kernel isn't going to
know when it's safe to delete the device.

So what I'm saying is that we either release it here, which isn't quite
right because we do reference data relating to the device later on. And
because it isn't quite right there should be a reason to justify it,
which is that the SMMU parent device is the same as the MC, so the
reference count isn't strictly necessary. But that's not quite obvious,
so highlighting it in a comment makes sense.

The other alternative is to not call put_device() here and keep on to
the reference as long as you keep using "mc". This might be difficult to
implement because it may not be obvious where to release it. I think
this is the better alternative, but if it's too complicated to implement
it might not be worth it.

This basically just means that SMMU needs to ensure that MC stays alive
(by holding a reference to it) as long as SMMU uses it. If the last
reference to MC is dropped, then the mc pointer and potentially anything
that it points to will become dangling. If you were to drop the last
reference at this point, then on the next line the mc pointer could
already be invalid.

That's how it generally works, anyway. What's special about this use-
case is that the SMMU and MC are the same device, so it should be safe
to omit this additional tracking because the IOMMU tracking should take
care of that already.

The shortcut is taking advantage of the knowledge that the SMMU and the
MC are the same device and therefore not properly track the MC object.
Given that their code is located in different locations, this isn't
obvious to the casual reader of the code, so they may assume that this
is the normal way to do things. To avoid that, the code should have a
comment explaining why that is.
