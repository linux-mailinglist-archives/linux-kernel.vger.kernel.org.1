I'm not sure that adjusting what you called "vruntime bonus" is the
right way to provide some latency because it doesn't only provide a
wakeup latency bonus but also provides a runtime bonus. It means that
one can impact the running time by playing with latency_nice whereas
the goal is only to impact the wakeup latency.  Instead, it should
weight the decision in wakeup_preempt_entity() and wakeup_gran()
