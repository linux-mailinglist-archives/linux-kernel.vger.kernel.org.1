It doesn't look like there's quite a lot of KASAN-specific logic there.

All those quarantine_*() calls are either at the beginning or at the
end of some kasan annotations, so it should be quite easy to move
those out. E.g. quarantine_reduce() can be moved together with the
gfpflags_allow_blocking(flags) check and put before kasan_kmalloc()
calls (or maybe also into some other places?), quarantine_put() can be
put after kasan_slab_free(), etc.

This solution doesn't look clean. Here you provide a second KASAN
runtime implementation, parallel to the original one, which only does
quarantine. It seems much cleaner to put quarantine logic into a
separate module, which can be either used independently, or together
with KASAN built on top of it.

Maybe other KASAN contributors have an opinion on this?
