May be arm32 using all new fancy specification we may come up to solve
certain areas but continue to use legacy boot/power methods. I may be
wrong. E.g: Today we enable HAVE_ARM_SMCCC for armv7 and above but not
all have PSCI enabled.

OK, but we still have above config.

Agreed and I am happy to keep it as is.
