I have tested on two platforms. On KBL desktop fd is 0 for this case, but on 
oncascadelakex server, fd is -1, so the BUG_ON(fd == -1) is triggered.

Not sure if it's enough to only use cpumask 0 because cstate_pkg/c2-residency/ 
should be per-socket.

Perhaps we directly remove the BUG_ON(fd == -1) assertion?
