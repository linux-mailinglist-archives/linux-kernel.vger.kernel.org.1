Yeah, another thought that came to mind later is that iommu-dma can use 
pages from any pool regardless of the device's DMA mask, so we could 
stand to be a lot less restrictive in that case too.

Perhaps it is better to just bite the bullet, keep the straightforward 
one-pool-per-zone setup, and implement the dma_coherent_ok() type 
fallback logic. More complexity for dma_alloc_from_pool(), but 
everything else stays nice and simple - lose the assumption that 
dev_to_pool() can work for this and and just let callers pass an 
allocation mask directly, and have dma_free_from_pool() simply check all 
available pools.

Robin.
