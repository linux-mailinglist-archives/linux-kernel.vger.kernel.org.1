The idea behind merging ranges it to address possible cases where a
range is broken up such that there is a hole in a max order block as a
result. By combining the ranges if they both span the same section we
can guarantee that the entire section will be initialized as a block
and not potentially have partially initialized sections floating
around. Without that mo_pfn logic I had in there I was getting panics
every so often when booting up one of my systems as I recall.

Also the iterator itself is cheap. It is basically just walking a
read-only list so it scales efficiently as well. One of the reasons
why I arranged the code the way I did is that it also allowed me to
get rid of an extra check in the code as the previous code was having
to verify if the pfn belonged to the node. That is all handled
directly through the for_each_free_mem_pfn_range_in_zone[_from] call
now.

I still think we are better off initializing complete sections since
the pageblock_flags are fully initialized that way as well. What
guarantee do you have that all of the memory ranges will be max order
aligned? The problem is we have to guarantee all pages are initialized
before we start freeing the pages in a max order page. If we just
process each block as-is I believe we can end up with some
architectures trying to access uninitialized memory in the buddy
allocator as a result. That is why the deferred_init_maxorder function
will walk through the iterator, using the _from version to avoid
unnecessary iteration, the first time initializing the pages it needs
to cross that max order boundary, and then again to free the max order
block of pages that have been initialized. The iterator itself is
farily cheap and only has to get you through the smaller ranges before
you end up at the one big range that it just kind of sits at while it
is working on getting it processed.
