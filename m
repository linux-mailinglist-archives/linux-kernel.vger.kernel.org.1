Are high-order allocations in general of interest to this platform? If
not then a potential option is to simply disable boosting. The patch is
still relevant but it's worth thinking about.

The comment is a bit difficult to parse. Maybe this.

	/*

	 * point where boosting is ignored so that kswapd is woken up

	 */

I left out the ALLOC_ part for reasons that are explained blow.

The second check is a bit more obscure than it needs to be and depends
on WMARK_MIN == 0. That will probably be true forever but it's not
obvious at a glance. I suggest something like
((alloc_flags & ALLOC_WMARK_MASK) == WMARK_MIN).

For detecting atomic alloctions, you rely on the either ALLOC_HARDER or
ALLOC_HIGH being set. ALLOC_HIGH can be set for non-atomic allocations
and ALLOC_HARDER can be set for RT tasks. You probably should just test
the gfp_mask because as it stands non-atomic allocations can ignore the
boost too.

Finally, the patch puts an unlikely check into a relatively fast path even
though watermarks may be fine with or without boosting.  Instead you could
put the checks in zone_watermark_fast() if and only if the watermarks
failed the first time. If the checks pass, the watermarks get checked
a second time. This will be fractionally slower for requests failing
watermark checks but there is no penalty for most allocation requests.
It would need the gfp_mask to be passed into zone_watermark_fast but
as it's an inlined function, there should be no cost to passing in the
arguement i.e. do something like this at the end of zone_watermark_fast

	if (__zone_watermark_ok(z, order, mark, classzone_idx, alloc_flags, free_pages))
		return true;

	/* Ignore watermark boosting for .... */
	if (unlikely(!order .....) {
		mark = ...
		return __zone_watermark_ok(...);
	}

	return false;
