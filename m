Subject: [PATCH 18/27] blk-iocost: implement Andy's method for donation weight updates

iocost implements work conservation by reducing iocg->inuse and propagating
the adjustment upwards proportionally. However, while I knew the target
absolute hierarchical proportion - adjusted hweight_inuse, I couldn't figure
out how to determine the iocg->inuse adjustment to achieve that and
approximated the adjustment by scaling iocg->inuse using the proportion of
the needed hweight_inuse changes.

When nested, these scalings aren't accurate even when adjusting a single
node as the donating node also receives the benefit of the donated portion.
When multiple nodes are donating as they often do, they can be wildly wrong.

iocost employed various safety nets to combat the inaccuracies. There are
ample buffers in determining how much to donate, the adjustments are
conservative and gradual. While it can achieve a reasonable level of work
conservation in simple scenarios, the inaccuracies can easily add up leading
to significant loss of total work. This in turn makes it difficult to
closely cap vrate as vrate adjustment is needed to compensate for the loss
of work. The combination of inaccurate donation calculations and vrate
adjustments can lead to wide fluctuations and clunky overall behaviors.

Andy Newell devised a method to calculate the needed ->inuse updates to
achieve the target hweight_inuse's. The method is compatible with the
proportional inuse adjustment propagation which allows all hot path
operations to be local to each iocg.

To roughly summarize, Andy's method divides the tree into donating and
non-donating parts, calculates global donation rate which is used to
determine the target hweight_inuse for each node, and then derives per-level
proportions. There's non-trivial amount of math involved. Please refer to
the following pdfs for detailed descriptions.

This patch implements Andy's method in transfer_surpluses(). This makes the
donation calculations accurate per cycle and enables further improvements in
other parts of the donation logic.

+ * For work-conservation, an iocg which isn't using all of its share should
+ * donate the leftover to other iocgs. There are two ways to achieve this - 1.
+ * bumping up vrate accordingly 2. lowering the donating iocg's inuse weight.
+ *
+ * #1 is mathematically simpler but has the drawback of requiring synchronous
+ * global hweight_inuse updates when idle iocg's get activated or inuse weights
+ * change due to donation snapbacks as it has the possibility of grossly
+ * overshooting what's allowed by the model and vrate.
+ *
+ * #2 is inherently safe with local operations. The donating iocg can easily
+ * snap back to higher weights when needed without worrying about impacts on
+ * other nodes as the impacts will be inherently correct. This also makes idle
+ * iocg activations safe. The only effect activations have is decreasing
+ * hweight_inuse of others, the right solution to which is for those iocgs to
+ * snap back to higher weights.
+ *
+ * So, we go with #2. The challenge is calculating how each donating iocg's
+ * inuse should be adjusted to achieve the target donation amounts. This is done
+ * using Andy's method described in the following pdf.
+ *

+ *
+ * Given the weights and target after-donation hweight_inuse values, Andy's
+ * method determines how the proportional distribution should look like at each
+ * sibling level to maintain the relative relationship between all non-donating
+ * pairs. To roughly summarize, it divides the tree into donating and
+ * non-donating parts, calculates global donation rate which is used to
+ * determine the target hweight_inuse for each node, and then derives per-level
+ * proportions.
+ *
+ * The following pdf shows that global distribution calculated this way can be
+ * achieved by scaling inuse weights of donating leaves and propagating the
+ * adjustments upwards proportionally.
+ *
+ *   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vONz1-fzVO7oY5DXXsLjSxEtYYQbOvsE
+ *
+ * Combining the above two, we can determine how each leaf iocg's inuse should
