I just retested compiling tip/locking/core, and it seems something
changed the last time I wrote the patch. Removing <linux/compat.h> will
indeed break the compilation now, the patch bellow should fix it. Sorry
for the noise.

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] futex: Add compat include

Commit 38aa3c15b3a4 removed includes that seemed to be unused.
However, removing <linux/compat.h> makes the compilation fail if the
build configuration supports compatibility ABIs. Fix that by
reinserting the include.
