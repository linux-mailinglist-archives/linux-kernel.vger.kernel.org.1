I agree that the changelog can be made more clear. Any objection if I send v2 
with changelog changes to that effect, then? :-)

We actually over reclaim even before this patch -- this patch doesn't bring 
much new in that regard.

Tracing try_to_free_pages for a cgroup at the memory.high threshold shows that 
before this change, we sometimes even reclaim on the order of twice the number 
of pages requested. For example, I see cases where we requested 1000 pages to 
be reclaimed, but end up reclaiming 2000 in a single reclaim attempt.
