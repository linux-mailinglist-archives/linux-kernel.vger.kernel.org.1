For the panel conversion I did recently it was simple:
1) If listed in MAINTAINERS - use this info
2) Otherwise use the person(s) that authored the original .txt file.
   Using git log --follow foo.txt
3) In a few cases I may have decided otherwise, but the above covers the
   majority.

I would also be great if you or someone else could:
- teach get_maintainers about .yaml file listed maintainers
- teach checkpatch that it is OK to convert .txt to .yaml
- teach checkpatch about some simple yaml validation (maybe)

I am looking forward to the day we have more .yaml files
than .txt files in Documentation/devicetree/binding/*
