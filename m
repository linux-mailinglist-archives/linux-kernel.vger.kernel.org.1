It most certainly does.

With INTERCONNECT as a bool we can handle its absence with stub
functions - like every other framework does. But as a tristate then
every driver with a call to the interconnect api needs an entry in
Kconfig to ensure the client driver must be a module if the interconnect
framework is.
