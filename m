ok

Actually the new "pp3300_hub" it is also on at boot, the Chrome OS bootloader
asserts the GPIO.

Our EEs told me that it would be ok in terms of power to keep "pp3300_hub_7c"
powered, since there would be no significant power consumption without load.

In any case unused RPMH regulators are switched off by the kernel ~30s after
boot, so I think we are ok:

[   31.202219] ldo7: disabling

The above is from the l7c regulator on a Lazor rev2.

true, it's not really needed, I'll get rid of it in the next version.

ack, will change
