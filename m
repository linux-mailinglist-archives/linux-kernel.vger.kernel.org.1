Ah, OK - I still don't have the best comprehension of what exactly 
swgroups are, and the path through .of_xlate looked like you might be 
using the PCI requester ID as the swgroup identifier, but I guess that 
ultimately depends on what your "iommu-map" is supposed to look like. If 
pci_device_group() will effectively only ever get called once regardless 
of how many endpoints exist, then indeed this won't be a concern 
(although if that's *guaranteed* to be the case then you may as well 
just stick with calling iommu_group_alloc() directly). Thanks for 
clarifying.

Robin.
