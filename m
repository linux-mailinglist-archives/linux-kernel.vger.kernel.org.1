The Atom C6562 is "24 cores" based on 
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/atom-p5900-product-brief.pdf

#define MSR_PLATFORM_INFO		0x000000ce

the value for this msr is 80820f9801600

#define MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT		0x000001ad

the value for this msr is 16

I know you didn't test your feature on this platform,
but combinations of other various values ​​are also possible
(unless it's made clear in the specification).

Hence the "less than 4 cores" comment is weird for C6562
but the use of "1C turbo" looks good to me.
