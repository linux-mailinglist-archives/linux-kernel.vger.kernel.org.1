First, why would you put it in the architecture include anyway? That
is really board-specific. That is like you would say, we enable all
devices and a board could potentially disable it. TBH it seems that
this will fit your reference boards and you don't care about the
other ones which uses that include.

And as Vladimir pointed out, what do you do if you just have the eMMC
on the LS1028A. It will be mmcblk1 unless you do something like the
following in the board dts:

mmc0 = &esdhc;
/delete-property/ mmc1;

That is really cumbersome, isnt it?
