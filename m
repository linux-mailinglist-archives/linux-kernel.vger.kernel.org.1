Hi Linus,

/* Summary */
This is a series announced some time back (cf. [2]) when we reworked a chunk of
the process creation paths in the kernel and switched to struct
{kernel_}clone_args.

High-level this does two main things:
1. Remove the double export of both do_fork() and _do_fork() where do_fork()
   used the incosistent legacy clone calling convention. Now we only export
   _do_fork() which is based on struct kernel_clone_args.
2. Remove the copy_thread_tls()/copy_thread() split making the
   architecture specific HAVE_COYP_THREAD_TLS config option obsolete.

This switches all remaining architectures to select HAVE_COPY_THREAD_TLS and
thus to the copy_thread_tls() calling convention. The current split makes the
process creation codepaths more convoluted than they need to be. Each
architecture has their own copy_thread() function unless it selects
HAVE_COPY_THREAD_TLS then it has a copy_thread_tls() function. The split is not
needed anymore nowadays, all architectures support CLONE_SETTLS but quite a few
of them never bothered to select HAVE_COPY_THREAD_TLS and instead simply
continued to use copy_thread() and use the old calling convention.
Removing this split cleans up the process creation codepaths and paves the way
for implementing clone3() on such architectures since it requires the
copy_thread_tls() calling convention.
After having made each architectures support copy_thread_tls() this series
simply renames that function back to copy_thread().
It also switches all architectures that call do_fork() directly over to
_do_fork() and the struct kernel_clone_args calling convention. This is a
corollary of switching the architectures that did not yet support it over to
copy_thread_tls() since do_fork() is conditional on not supporting
copy_thread_tls() (Mostly because it lacks a separate argument for tls which is
trivial to fix but there's no need for this function to exist.).

The do_fork() removal is in itself already useful as it allows to to remove the
export of both do_fork() and _do_fork() we currently have in favor of only
_do_fork(). This has already been discussed back when we added clone3(). The
legacy clone() calling convention is - as is probably well-known - somewhat odd
or as Al once put it in arch/Kconfig (cf. [1]):

  #
  # ABI hall of shame
  #
  config CLONE_BACKWARDS
  config CLONE_BACKWARDS2
  config CLONE_BACKWARDS3

that is aggravated by the fact that some architectures such as sparc follow the
CLONE_BACKWARDSx calling convention but don't really select the corresponding
config option since they call do_fork() directly.
So do_fork() enforces a somewhat arbitrary calling convention in the first place
that doesn't really help the individual architectures that deviate from it. They
can thus simply be switched to _do_fork() enforcing a single calling convention.
(I really hope that any new architectures will __not__ try to implement their
 own calling conventions...) Most architectures already have made a similar
switch (m68k comes to mind).

Overall this removes more code then it adds even with a good portion of added
comments. It simplifies a chunk of arch specific assembly either by moving the
code into C or by simply rewriting the assembly.

Architectures that have been touched in non-trivial ways have all been actually
boot and stress tested: sparc and ia64 have been tested with Debian 9 images.
They are the two architectures which have been touched the most. All non-trivial
changes to architectures have seen acks from the relevant maintainers.
nios2 with a custom built buildroot image. h8300 I couldn't get something
bootable to test on but the changes have been fairly automatic and I'm sure
we'll hear people yell if I broke something there. All other architectures that
have been touched in trivial ways have been compile tested for each single patch
of the series via git rebase -x "make ..." v5.8-rc2. arm{64} and x86{_64} have
been boot tested even though they have just been trivially touched (removal of
the HAVE_COPY_THREAD_TLS macro from their Kconfig) because well they are
basically "core architectures" and since it is trivial to get your hands on a
useable image.

/* Testing */
All patches are based on v5.8-rc2 and have been sitting in linux-next. No build
failures or warnings were observed. All old and new tests of relevant
test-suites are passing.

/* Conflicts */
There are a few smaller conflicts that linux-next reported:

1. csky tree: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200803182550.4c7df8ae@canb.auug.org.au
   Stephen's suggestion to fix it seems correct:

3. riscv tree: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200713165846.5166ff82@canb.auug.org.au

4. memlock tree: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200706155811.7928b30d@canb.auug.org.au
   The conflict is in arch/unicore32/kernel/process.c and it seems that the
   unicore32 port is about to be removed. So if that tree lands than the changes
   in 8496da092a53 ("unicore: switch to copy_thread_tls()") can just be dropped
   similar to what Stephen did for linux-next.

Fwiw, doing a test-merge with current mainline bcf876870b95 ("Linux 5.8") shows me:

brauner@wittgenstein|~/src/git/linux/linux|master $%=
