OK, sounds good, I misunderstood your ideas, I mixed the 2) and 3)
and see them as the same thing. Many thanks for the clear explanation.

I'm not sure whether this SBI call is only for SBI PMU counter and
it's own events.
For 2), it needs one SBI call to set the events, we just set the event selector
by writing m-mode CSRs on s-mode now. If this SBI call could serve 2)
and 3) both,
we don't need another SBI call.
