This is exactly what I've done for VFIO.  Some performance results:

    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20181105165558.11698-10-daniel.m.jordan@oracle.com/

and a semi-current branch is here if anyone wants to test it:

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20200212224731.kmss6o6agekkg3mw@ca-dmjordan1.us.oracle.com/

One of the issues with starting extra threads for paths triggered from
userspace such as VFIO is that they need to be properly throttled by relevant
resource controls such as cgroup (CPU controller especially) and
sched_setafffinity.  This type of control for kernel threads has another use
case too, async memcg reclaim.  All this is second on my list after I post a
series that multithreads deferred page init and sets up the basic
infrastructure for multithreading other paths, which I hope will be ready soon.

I haven't looked closely at memmap_init_zone, though I've tried
memmap_init_zone_device.  Will take a closer look to see how well this could be
incorporated.
