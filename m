... if you set SRCARCH.

If SRCARCH is unset, it will get a warning.

$ ./scripts/tags.sh  gtags
find: =E2=80=98arch/*.[chS]/=E2=80=99: No such file or directory

This is a problem of GNU Global, not of our build system.


"Warning: ... is out of source tree." is listed in
the known bugs:

https://www.gnu.org/software/global/bugs.html


Do not mess up our script.

Of course, "make O=3D123 distclean" cannot clean up
build artifacts created by "make gtags".

So, what problem are you addressing?

You are misunderstanding.

See the comment at line 8.

# Uses the following environment variables:
# SUBARCH, SRCARCH, srctree


If you want to run this script directly,
you must set all the mentioned environment variables correctly,
and also run this script in the correct working directory.

It will create tag files in the current working directory.
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do not change the working directory internally.

This is the intended behavior for the other TAGS, tags, cscope.

Again, this is a problem of GNU global.


The general rule is like this:

Tag files should be always output to the separate object tree
if O=3D is given, then file paths should point to the source
tree with either relative or absolute paths.

This is because the source tree is not always writable.
The source tree might be delivered in a DVD-ROM, read-only mounted nfs,
or located under /usr/src/ which is installed by distro source package.

No.
scripts/tags.sh must be run in the object tree in this case.

5) make O=3D123; cd 123; ../scripts/tags.sh srctree=3D.. SRCARCH=3Dx86 gtag=
s

I know. Probably, that would not happen
because the following patch is queued up.

I see bad engineering overall, and
it is breaking

So, this is NACK.
