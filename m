So on the Juno (ttyAMA0), the first time I see us hitting
uart_port_spin_lock_init() is via:

  uart_add_one_port() ->  uart_port_spin_lock_init()

Since port->cons->(index, line) is (-1, 0) at this point in time,
uart_console(port) returns false and we init the spinlock. When then
happily trickle down to uart_configure_port() -> register_console()


On the Hikey960 (ttyAMA6) I see the same initial flow, but (index, line)
is (6, 6), so uart_console(port) returns true and we skip the
spin_lock_init(). When then hit the splat on the rest of the way down
uart_add_one_port().


I did a tiny bit of git spelunking; I found a commit that changed
uart_console_enabled() into uart_console() within
uart_port_spin_lock_init():

  a3cb39d258ef ("serial: core: Allow detach and attach serial device for console")

Reverting just that one change in uart_port_spin_lock_init() seems to go
fine on both Juno & HiKey960, but I think that doesn't play well with the
rest of the aforementioned commit. I think that this initial (index, line)
tuple is to blame, though I've added Andy in Cc just in case.
