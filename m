I now see what you mean.

I was trying to blindly fit CMA with arm64's DMA zone setup, which, as it turns
out, doesn't really honor its purpose. arm64 introduced ZONE_DMA to provide a
30-bit address space, but we're creating it regardless of whether it exists or
not. This creates a mismatch between zone_dma_bits and ZONE_DMA's real
placement. I'll try to look at fixing that in arm64.

Yes, sorry for the wait, I've been on vacation and short on time, I'll send it
during the day.
