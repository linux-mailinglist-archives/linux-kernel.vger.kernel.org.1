I won't re-format unless I hear something within a few days in case
you want me to try something.

Preface: There was a notable power outage a couple of nights ago.
When the power returned, everything seemed fine. No issues during
bootup or anything.
Then today, I went to open an application and my system started
schitzing out with programs suddenly closing(/crashing?).
I switched tty and tried to log in but was unable to even be allowed
to enter in my password.
I switched to another and tried logging in as root which succeeded (somehow).
I looked at the journal and saw an entry saying something about
/bin/login not being a valid exec format.
I went to reboot and when it got to fsck part of initramfs, it failed
and I was kicked to root.
I ran fsck and saw a bunch of issues, but I guess nothing could get
resolved enough to let me reboot.
Oh, in case you're wondering, my / (system) is on a 64GB SDHC card.
I just happened to also have an older / system on my mechanical drive
using BTRFS which I could boot to (which I'm on now).
I ran fsck from this older system and it seems I got the same results:

So if you want more information or need me to try something, let me
know soon if you would. Otherwise, I'll just be reformatting my card
in a few days.
It just could've been a fluke occurred because of the power outage but
didn't manifest itself until today.
