Subject: [PATCH] RFC: ACPI / OSI: remove workarounds for hybrid graphics laptops

It's hard to figure out what systems are actually affected and right now I
don't see a good way of removing those...

But I'd like to see thos getting removed and drivers fixed instead (which
happened at least for nouveau).

And as mentioned before, I prefer people working on fixing issues instead
of spending time to add firmware level workarounds which are hard to know
to which systems they apply to, hard to remove and basically a big huge
pain to work with.
In the end I have no idea how to even figure out what systems are affected
and which not by this, so I have no idea how to even verify we can safely
remove this (which just means those are impossible to remove unless we risk
breaking systems, which again makes those supper annoying to deal with).

Also from the comments it's hard to get what those bits really do. Are they
just preventing runtime pm or do the devices are powered down when booting?
I am sure it's the former, still...

Please, don't do this again.

For now, those workaround prevent power savings on systems those workaround
applies to, which might be any so those should get removed asap and if
new issues arrise removing those please do a proper bug report and we can
look into it and come up with a proper fix (and keep this patch out until
we resolve all of those).
