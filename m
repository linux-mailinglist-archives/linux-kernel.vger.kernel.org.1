Date:   Mon, 20 Apr 2020 02:51:14 +0800

From: Pierre-Louis Bossart <pierre-louis.bossart@linux.intel.com>

The current description of stream topologies does not explicitly
mention 'mirror' topologies used for audio amplifiers, where all
amplifiers see the same data and generate a different output based on
configuration or dynamic information. Add examples and notes to
explain how channels can be transmitted and mapped.

+Note1: In multi-link cases like above, to lock, one would acquire a global
 lock and then go on locking bus instances. But, in this case the caller
 framework(ASoC DPCM) guarantees that stream operations on a card are
 always serialized. So, there is no race condition and hence no need for
 global lock.
 
+Note2: A Slave device may be configured to receive all channels
+transmitted on a link for a given Stream (Example 4) or just a subset
+of the data (Example 3). The configuration of the Slave device is not
+handled by a SoundWire subsystem API, but instead by the
+snd_soc_dai_set_tdm_slot() API. The platform or machine driver will
+typically configure which of the slots are used. For Example 4, the
+same slots would be used by all Devices, while for Example 3 the Slave
+Device1 would use e.g. Slot 0 and Slave device2 slot 1.
+
+Note3: Multiple Sink ports can extract the same information for the
+same bitSlots in the SoundWire frame, however multiple Source ports
+shall be configured with different bitSlot configurations. This is the
+same limitation as with I2S/PCM TDM usages.
