I recently realized that only the 'maximum number of regions' is respected,
meanwhile the 'minimum number of regions' isn't.  In the next spin, I will
update the code to 1) set new internal variable, 'max_sz_region' as size of
entire monitoring target regions divided by the 'minimum number of regions',
and 2) avoid merging regions if it results in region of size larger than that.

This change would make DAMON more flexible for special cases.  For example,
some use cases would need static granularity monitoring.  In such case, users
will be able to adjust the granularity by controlling the 'minimum number of
regions', and avoid the split/merge of regions by setting the 'maximum number
of regions' as same to the 'minimum number of regions'.


Thanks,
