Greetings from Miss Jeannette Bryan.

How are you and your family doing today?Hope fine? I would like to use
this opportunity to introduce myself to you. I am Miss Jeannette
Bryan. My parents are Mr. and Mrs. Dikko Bryan ; my father was a
highly reputable business magnet who operated  Sao Tome & Principe
during his days.

I am writing this mail to you with tears and sorrow from my heart.
With due respect, trust and humanity, I know this mail will come to
you as a surprise since we don=E2=80=99t know  each other before, and also
considering the fact that I sourced your email contact through the
Internet in search of a trusted person who can assist me.

It is sad to say that my dad passed away mysteriously in France during
one of his business trips abroad. Though his sudden death was linked
or rather suspected to have been masterminded by his half brother who
traveled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother
died when I was just 6yrs old, and since then my father took me so
special.

A month before his death, he told me that he had money left in a fixed
deposit account in one of the leading banks. He further told me that
he deposited the money in my name. He gave me the file to this fund
with the bank.

I am 21 years old and a university undergraduate. I really don't know
what to do or who to turn to here. My uncles are only after what to
get from my dad=E2=80=99s properties. They have shared the landed propertie=
s
amongst themselves claiming that our tradition does not permit a woman
to inherit anything. Now I want an account overseas where I can
transfer this funds and after the transaction I will come and reside
permanently in your country till such a time that it will be
convenient for me to return back home if I so desire.

The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I also want
to invest the fund under your care because I am ignorant of the
business world. I am in a sincere desire for your humble assistance in
this regard. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Reply
me on this email for more information: (
miss.jeannettebryan@yandex.com )

Now permit me to ask these few questions:

1. Can you honestly help me from your heart?
2. Can I completely trust you?
3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for
you after the money is in your account?

Please, consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
Immediately I confirm your willingness, I will send you my Picture and
also inform you more details involved in this matter.

Kind Regards,
Miss Jeannette Bryan
