Does this only happen when you specify gigantic pages as the default huge
page size and they are not allocated at boot time?  Or, are there other
situations where this happens?  If so, can you provide a sample of the
boot parameters used, or how to recreate.

I am fixing up the issue with gigantic pages, and suspect this will take
are of all the issues you are seeing.  This will be part of the command line
cleanup series.  Just want to make sure I am not missing something.
