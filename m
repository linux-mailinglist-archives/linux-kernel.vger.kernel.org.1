With a large data correlation we can make this work the best, in the 
modern time.

ITL - a fair pay orinted linux distribution with the optimal goal of 
perfection as much as can be over time.

Samáj Trance Drum - Trance music connected to its roots, and represented 
in an optimal way.

I/T Eon Enligthened - A chan-realized concept of The Dewa, solving 
sectarian schisms, with this accurate concept.

Samepodiet Parti - a politican party and speakerbox for when needed.

Akraxaz - a game idea supporting 3-D culture all the way back to c-64 
and now Vulkan.

Hoods 4' G-d: Christanity has gone gay support, and this seems optimal 
economically from the alpha-christian Jung perspective.

This is all part of potentiality blocks out, and realizing culture in 
the I/T Eon the best way.
