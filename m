I don't see how that is possible. Because the cpuhp threads run during the
CPU onlining process, the boot thread for the CPU coming online would have
already updated the mask.

Ok, done.

Done. Sorry my testing did not catch it, but it eventually caused a problem
after several hours of the stress test so I'd have eventually caught it.

Then don't keep the core_pick set then. If you don't send it IPI and if
core_pick is already running, then NULL it already. I don't know why we add
to more corner cases by making assumptions. We have enough open issues that
are not hotplug related. Here's my suggestion :

1.  Keep the ideas consistent, forget about the exact code currently written
and just understand the pick_seq is for siblings knowing that something was
picked for the whole core.  So if their pick_seq != sched_seq, then they have
to pick what was selected.

2. If core_pick should be NULL, then NULL it in some path. If you keep some
core_pick and you increment pick_seq, then you are automatically asking the
sibling to pick that task up then next time it enters schedule(). See if [1]
will work?

Note that, we have added logic in this patch that does a full selection if
rq->core_pick == NULL.

That can be a separate patch IMHO. It has nothing to do with
stability/crashing of concurrent and rather infrequent CPU hotplug
operations.

Also, Peter said pick_seq is for core-wide picking. If you want to add
another semantic, then maybe add another counter which has a separate
meaning and justify why you are adding it.

thanks,
