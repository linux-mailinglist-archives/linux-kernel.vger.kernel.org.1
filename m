Dunno. with the 2 b311142fcfd37b58dfec72e040ed04949eb1ac86 and cce1faba82645fee899ccef5b7d3050fed3a3d10,
in split view, I wasn't able to make the 'config description' show anything wrong,
in regard to currently selected item in 'config' and in 'menu'
At that point this is mostly an academic interset for me since,
the patch that you sent fixes search. Thank you very much!

BTW, I re-discovered another bug (I have seen it already but it didn't bother me that much),
while trying to break the version with these commits reverted (but it happens 
with them not reverted as well):

When I enable 'show debug info' to understand why I can't enable/disable some config
option, the hyperlinks in the config description don't work - they make the config
window to be empty.

Best regards and thanks again,
