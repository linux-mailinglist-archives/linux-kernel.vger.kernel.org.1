Hm, idk, is it a realistic setup? Looks like it depends significantly on
the exact usecase.

Another option is to move the cma area closer to the beginning of a zone.

After the second thought it's not so obvious: CMA would need to migrate pages
(data) between zones, right? It might bring some other complications.

Yeah, if it will happen soon-ish, we can just wait. I just don't know
how hard it is and how many edge cases are there to be figured out first.

Do you think that it's better to wait and do not merge this patch upstream?

Thanks!
