Is this really better option than silencing soft lockup from the code
itself? What if the same access pattern happens later on?

As all of those seem to be the same class of process I suspect it is
more likely that many processes are hitting the page fault on the same
file page. E.g. a code/library.

I have only seen this single instance on that machine. I do not think
this is very much HW specific but ppc platform is likely more prone to
that. Just think of the memory itself. Each memory block is notified via
udev and ppc has very small memblocks (16M to 256M). X86 will use 2G
blocks on large machines.

I would be really suprised if memory barriers matter much. It sounds
much more likely that there is the same underlying problem as
11a19c7b099f. There are just too many waiters on the page. The commit
prevents just the hard lockup part of the problem by dropping the lock
and continuing after the bookmark. But, as mentioned in the changelog,
cond_resched is not really an option because this path is called from
atomic context as well. So !PREEMPT kernels are still in the same boat.

I might have misunderstood something, of course, and would like to hear
where is my thinking wrong.
