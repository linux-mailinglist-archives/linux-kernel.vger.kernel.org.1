It does. Actually, reserve_map + reserved-ranges are reserved as soon as
memblock allocator is ready but not before crashkernel reservation.
Check early_reserve_mem() call in kernel/prom.c

So, kdump could possibly overwrite these regions which is why an exclude
range list is needed. Same thing was done in kexec-tools as well.
