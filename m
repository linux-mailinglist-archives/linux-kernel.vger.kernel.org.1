The controller only generates XferInProgress if it had processed a TRB=20
(with specific control bits). For IN direction, if the controller is=20
starved of TRB, it will send a ZLP if the host requests for data.

The controller is expecting the function driver to feed TRBs to the=20
controller for every interval. If it's late, then the controller will=20
consider that data "missed_isoc".

In your case, the UVC driver seems to queue requests to the controller=20
driver as if it is bulk requests, and the UVC expects those data to go=20
out at the time it queues. To achieve what UVC needs, then you may want=20
to issue END_TRANSFER command before the next burst of data. This way,=20
the controller can restart the isoc endpoint and not consider the next=20
video frame data late. There are some corner cases that you need to=20
watch out for. If you're going for this route, we can look further.

Also, you'd need provide a way for the UVC to communicate to the dwc3 to=20
let it know to expect the next burst of data.

If END_TRANSFER command completes, then you should not see=20

Just curious, do you know if there's a reason for UVC to behave this=20
way? Seems like what it's trying to do is more for bulk. Maybe it wants=20
bandwidth priority perhaps?
