This very much looks to be the right thing to do. Returning "0" from
a failed RDMSR in MCE handling might be a much worse thing to do than
crashing. It papers over a serious error and the system might keep
running using corrupted data.

Digging into the history it seems that this rdmsrl_safe() was added for
a possible bug on a pentiumIII back in 2009 that was eventually closed
as "unreproducible".

Do we have three distinct classes of calls to RDMSR now?


1) This case. Architecture checks have been made. This call can't
fail. We are calling from a tricky state (on IST) so no tracing
allowed.

2) Normal case ... architecture checks have been done so shouldn't
fail. Safe state for tracing etc. Use rdmsrl().

3) Probe case. Architecture didn't provide definitive enumeration,
so we might take a #GP. Use the rdmsrl_safe().

If mce subsystem is the only instance of case "1", then this
inline is OK.  If there are others then rather than inlining
the asm here, we should have some new rdmsrl_notrace() inline
function declared for all to use.

Needs a:

Fixes: 11868a2dc4f5 ("x86: mce: Use safer ways to access MCE registers")

since this is undoing an earlier change.
