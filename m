JFYI, to prove that this is not a problem which affects only our HW, I 
managed to test an arm64 platform from another vendor. Generally I see 
the same issue, and this patchset actually helps that platform even more.

		CPUs	Before	After	% Increase
Huawei D06	8	282K	302K	7%
Other			379K	420K	11%

Huawei D06	16	115K	193K	68K
Other			102K	291K	185K

Huawei D06	32	36K	80K	122%
Other			41K	156K	280%

Huawei D06	64	11K	30K	172%
Other			6K	47K	683%

I tested with something like [1], so unit is map+unmaps per cpu per 
second - higher is better.

My D06 is memory poor, so would expect higher results otherwise (with 
more memory). Indeed, my D05 has memory on all nodes and performs better.

Anyway, I see that the implementation here is not perfect, and I could 
not get suggested approach to improve performance significantly. So back 
to the drawing board...

Thanks,
John
