I agree 2000% that it is not obvious. What made me consider it was that
I *knew* that the base directory would already exist, so it wouldn't
make sense for the code to rely on earlier parts of a table if part
of the hierarchy already existed.

In fact, a *huge* part of the due dilligence on this and futre series
on this cleanup will be to be 100% sure that the base path is already
created. And so this use is obviously dangerous, you just *need* to
know that the base path is created before.

Non-posted changes also deal with link order to help address this
in other places, given that link order controls how *initcalls()
(early_initcall(), late_initcall(), etc) are ordered if you have
multiple of these.

I had a link order series long ago which augmented our ability to make
things clearer at a link order. Eventually I believe this will become
more important, specially as we end up wanting to async more code.

For now, we can only rely on manual code inspection for ensuring
proper ordering. Part of the implicit aspects of this cleanup is
to slowly make these things clearer for each base path.

So... the "fs" base path will actually end up being created in
fs/sysctl.c after we are *fully* done with the fs sysctl cleanups.
