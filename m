Actually, no, unfortunately it's not in that update.  Generating an on-
the-fly primary would involve the cryptographic security patch (same
mechanism as used to generate the null primary).  I was thinking I'd
extract just that piece and use it in a follow on.  So both the rework
of the key format and this extra patch that's not yet even broken out
of the TPM security series are required precursors.
