OK, you're a userspace audio application - enlighten me as to what exact 
chip you're running on here, and why you need to know:

card 0: HDMI [HDA ATI HDMI]

or how about here?

card 0: Intel [HDA Intel]


Furthermore, your argument works both ways - if the equivalent (or in 
common cases like DesignWare IP blocks, exact same) thing across 3 
different SoCs has 3 different names, then it's that much harder for 
userspace that wants to present a consistent behaviour. I don't know 
exactly why LibreELEC have downstream patches that standardise all the 
Rockchip ones to "HDMI", but I can't help noting that they do.

With simple-audio-card we're talking about trivial interfaces that often 
don't expose any controls at all, so there's unlikely to be much 
'configuration' for userspace to do beyond choosing which card to output to.

Robin.
