In [1]Â  we removed tcs->lock and are only using drv->lock , this should 
help avoid ABBA/deadlocks since we are operating on single lock.

Although it needs rebase on latest tip. Let me know i can resend the 
patch/if you want to club in this change (removing tcs->lock part) i am ok.

if (rpmh_rsc_ctrlr_is_busy(drv) || rpmh_flush(&drv->client)) {
 Â Â Â  Â Â Â  if (cpus_in_pm < num_online_cpus())
 Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  ret = NOTIFY_OK;

}

if rpmh_flush() failed because another CPU woken up and started rpmh 
transfer, we are ok to power down current cpu by returning NOTIFY_OK.

Can change this to return error only when last cpu failed to flush, like 
above.
