I don't think this makes sense for Linux, at least not in a way
that limits the way the kernel deals with simple things such as
LPI allocation.

We have systems in the tree where Linux route interrupts on behalf
of other agents in the system (see what the TI PRUSS subsystem does,
for example), and even direct interrupt injection is, to an extent,
doing that. This requires a standardised way for describing the routing,
the allocation, and potentially the life cycle of the interrupt.

But hardcoding the allocation based on some non-standard scheme
is not something I'm considering.

Thanks,

         M.
