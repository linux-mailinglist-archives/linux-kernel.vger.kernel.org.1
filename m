Under normal operation, a couple of pages per CPU, which would make
preallocation entirely reasonable.  Except that if someone does something
that floods RCU callbacks (close(open) in a tight userspace loop, for but
one example), then 2000 per CPU might not be enough, which on a 64-CPU
system comes to about 500MB.  This is beyond excessive for preallocation
on the systems I am familiar with.

And the flooding case is where you most want the reclamation to be
efficient, and thus where you want the pages.

This of course raises the question of how much memory the lockless caches
contain, but fortunately these RCU callback flooding scenarios also
involve process-context allocation of the memory that is being passed
to kfree_rcu().  That allocation should keep the lockless caches from
going empty in the common case, correct?

Please note that we will also need to apply this same optimization to
call_rcu(), which will have the same constraints.

Indeed, if we were talking a maximum of (say) 10 pages per CPU, we would
not be having this conversation.  ;-)
