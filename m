Yes, it's used by this dual purpose, which I have to admit I don't
like that much either.

One set of pages should be clearly used for RAM memory hotplug, and
the other to map foreign pages that are not related to memory hotplug,
it's just that we happen to need a physical region with backing struct
pages.

I'm certainly not familiar with the Linux memory subsystem, but if
that gets us a backing struct page and a kernel mapping then I would
say yes.

Seems like a fine solution.

Juergen: would you be OK to use a separate page-list for
alloc_xenballooned_pages on HVM/PVH using the logic described by
David?

I guess I would leave PV as-is, since it already has this reserved
region to map foreign pages.

Thanks, Roger.
