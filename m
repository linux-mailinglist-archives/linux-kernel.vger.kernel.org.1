I noticed a bug here,

Either need to unlock and return here.

+	default:
+               ret = NOTIFY_DONE;
+		goto exit;

Or

If you move this patch at the end of series, it should will work fine as is.
Since in patch 5 of this series,  pm_lock is removed, so return 
NOTIFY_DONE; do not any unlock.

When i pulled in only first two changes in this series i got spinlock 
recursion during suspend-resume.
Back when i pull in entire series for validation, the issue do not come 
because last patch removes pm_lock.

Thanks,
Maulik
