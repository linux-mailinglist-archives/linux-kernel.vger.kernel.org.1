I'll reply here, where the discussion diverges from this particular
patch.

We will stop pushing for this emulation. We have a couple of SSDs where
we disabled Append, we implemented support for them, and we wanted to
push the changes upstream. That's it. This is no politics not a
conspiracy against the current ZNS spec. We spent a lot of time working
on this spec and are actually doing a fair amount of work to support
Append other places in the stack. In any case, the fuzz stops here.
