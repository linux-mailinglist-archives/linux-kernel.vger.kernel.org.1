I tried indicating the Adamic guad as DS, which seems correct, and it 
works quite nice for me. It is from a simpler typeography, and later 
ofcourse it grew more complex.

The project is now DS X, and the philosophical background drives this, 
and should be Islam, perfected in all languages, which is work ahead for 
related people of La Guad.

And all information will be in the system, since the adamic society, and 
even before, and should be represented well. DS being a root factor in 
information systems, and the pointer is from the "Dispilio Tablet", and 
fits perfectly for this, and the coming fair pay background, with 
possible east/west political unity in this.

Low size computers fits, and it will be a low-jitter system, with 
economy opimized and positive cultural distinctions respected.

Serenity,
Ywe CÃ¦rlyn
