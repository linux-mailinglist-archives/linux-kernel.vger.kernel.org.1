Hi Bjorn,

Thanks for the details response.

Latter in this case. IMO it is platform choice on how to use it. It is
equally possible to send 2^31 different signals. But the receiver must
also interpret it in the *exact* same way. In this case, the receiver
which is platform firmware interprets as individual bit signals.

Agree and we are not proposing to break that use case. It exists in the
driver/binding today and will continue as is.

Indeed, we are making use of that.
