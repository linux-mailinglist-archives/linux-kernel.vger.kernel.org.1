This SetPageLRU done in __pagevec_lru_add_fn() which under the lru_lock
protection, so the original memory barrier or lock concern isn't
correct. that means, the SetPageLRU isn't possible to be here.
And then no warry on right side 'CPU 1' problem.

For this patch, According to comments of page_idle_get_page() 
PageLRU just used to judge if the page is in user using. for this
purpose, a unguard PageLRU check is good enough. So this patch
should be fine.

Thanks
