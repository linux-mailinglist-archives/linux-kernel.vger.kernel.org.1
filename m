Hi Jens,

Sorry, the past few months have been *crazy* insane.  Between Linux
Plumbers Conference organizing, having to deal with some interns at
$WORK, performance reviews, etc.., etc., it's been a perfect storm.
As a result, I was late getting the primary ext4 pull request to
Linus, and he's already yelled at me for a late pull request.

As a result, I'm being super paranoid about asking Linus for anything,
even a one-time change, if it's not a bug fix.  And what you are
asking for isn't a bug fix, but enabling a new feature.

Worse, right now, -rc1 and -rc2 is causing random crashes in my
gce-xfstests framework.  Sometimes it happens before we've run even a
single xfstests; sometimes it happens after we have successfully
completed all of the tests, and we're doing a shutdown of the VM under
test.  Other times it happens in the middle of a test run.  Given that
I'm seeing this at -rc1, which is before my late ext4 pull request to
Linus, it's probably not an ext4 related bug.  But it also means that
I'm partially blind in terms of my kernel testing at the moment.  So I
can't even tell Linus that I've run lots of tests and I'm 100%
confident your one-line change is 100% safe.

Next week after Labor Day, I should be completely done with the
performance review writeups that are on my plate, and I will hopefully
have a bit more time to try to debug these mysterious failures.  Or
maybe someone else will be able to figure out what the heck is going
wrong, and perhaps -rc3 will make all of these failures go away.

I'm sorry your frustrated; I'm frustrated too!  But until I can find
the time to do a full bisect (v5.8 works just fine.  v5.9-rc1 is
flakey as hell when booting my test config in a GCE VM), I'm not in a
position to send anything to Linus.

Sorry,

						- Ted
