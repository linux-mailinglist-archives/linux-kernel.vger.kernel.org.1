Hi Moritz,

Sorry for late reply, I was out last week.

Yes, it is possible and it is not safe. But we will inform our customers 
they should update to the latest firmware (SDM firmware and ATF) if they 
want to have authentication feature.

We are migrating boot loader boot flow to the new ATF boot flow, which 
is SDM firmware -> SPL -> ATF -> U-boot proper -> Linux. The new 
authentication feature is supported only in the new ATF boot flow. ATF 
communicates with SDM firmware via mailbox, and SDM firmware performs 
the actual full/partial reconfiguration and bitstream authentication. 
ATF sets up EL3 environment and initializes PSCI services.

The old boot flow is SDM firmware -> SPL -> U-boot proper -> Linux, 
which SPL/U-boot handles PSCI services and communicates with SDM 
firmware via mailbox. SDM firmware performs the actual full/partial 
reconfiguration.

ATF = Arm Trust Firmware, SDM = Secure Device Manager

It is not feasible for kernel driver to get the firmware version per 
current designs and implementations. I don't think there is other way 
around this.
