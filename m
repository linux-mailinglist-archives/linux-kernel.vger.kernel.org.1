That's just broken :-( You can keep it marked and then strip it out at
the end if it turns out it wasn't needed after all (of course I do
realize this might not be entirely as trivial as it sounds).

Agreed, that's quite horrible and fragile.

This; any excursion out of noinstr for an unknown reason can have
unknown side effects which we might not be able to deal with at that
point.

For instance, if we cause a #PF before the current #PF has read CR2,
we're hosed. If we hit a hardware breakpoint before we're ready for it,
we're hosed (and we explicitly disallow setting breakpoints on noinstr,
but not stuff outside it).

So IFF UBSAN only calls out when things have gone wrong, as opposed to
checking if things go wrong (say, an out-of-line bounds check), then,
indeed, assuming no bug, no harm in having them.

And in that regard they're no different from all the WARN_ON() crud we
have all over the place, those are deemed safe under the assumption they
don't happen either.

Yes, I think so. Let me go have dinner and then I'll try and do a patch
to that effect.
