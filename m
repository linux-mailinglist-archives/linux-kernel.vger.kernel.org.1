On my test bed I didn't see a fs corruption, what I saw was a failing orphan
self test while playing with O_TMPFILE and linkat().

When you create a tmpfile it has a link count of 0 and an orphan is
installed. Such that the tmpfile is gone after a reboot but you can
still use it prior to that.
By using linkat() you can raise the link counter to 1 again.
Thus, the orphan needs to be removed.
This is pattern overlayfs uses a lot.

Since UBIFS never supported raising the link counter from 0 to 1
we have many corner cases and fixing all these turned out into a nightmare.
...as you can see from the amount broken patches from me :-(.

Thanks,
