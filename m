I think this decoupling is not necessary. The natural place for those
scheduler trace_event based on trace_points extension files is
kernel/sched/ and here the internal sched.h can just be included.

If someone really wants to build this as an out-of-tree module there is
an easy way to make kernel/sched/sched.h visible.

CFLAGS_sched_tp.o := -I$KERNEL_SRC/kernel/sched

all:
    make -C $KERNEL_SRC M=$(PWD) modules

This allowed me to build our trace_event extension module (sched_tp.c,
sched_events.h) out-of-tree and I was able to get rid of all the
sched_trace_foo() functions (in fair.c, include/linux/sched.h) and code
there content directly in foo.c

There are two things we would need exported from the kernel:

(1) cfs_rq_tg_path() to print the path of a taskgroup cfs_rq or se.

(2) sched_uclamp_used so uclamp_rq_util_with() can be used in
    sched_events.h.

I put Phil Auld on cc because of his trace_point
sched_update_nr_running_tp. I think Phil was using sched_tp as a base so
I can't see an issue why we can't also remove sched_trace_rq_nr_running().

Let's keep the footprint of these trace points as small as possible in
the scheduler code.

I'm putting the changes I described above in our monthly EAS integration
right now and when this worked out nicely I will share the patches on lkml.
