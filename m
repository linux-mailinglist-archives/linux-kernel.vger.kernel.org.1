Thanks for the feedback. I have updated the patch with the requested 
changes.

pstate_val only indicates thumb execution, not whether the current 
instruction
is a T16 or T32 instruction.

--- For thumb instructions, call_undef_hook() in traps.c first reads a 
u16, and if the u16 indicates a T32 instruction (u16 >= 0xe800), a 
second u16 is read, which then makes up the the lower half-word of a T32 
instruction. For T16 instructions, the second u16 is not read, which 
makes the resulting u32 opcode always have the upper half set to 0. 
However, having the upper half of instr_mask in the undef_hook set to 0 
masks out the upper half of all thumb instructions - both T16 and T32. 
This results in trapped T32 instructions with the lower half-word equal 
to the T16 encoding of setend (b650) being matched, even though the 
upper half-word is not 0000 and thus indicates a T32 opcode. An example 
of such a T32 instruction is eaa0b650, which should raise a SIGILL since 
T32 instructions with an eaa prefix are unallocated as per Arm ARM, but 
instead works as a SETEND because the second half-word is set to b650. 
This patch fixes the issue by extending instr_mask to include the upper 
u32 half, which will still match T16 instructions where the upper half 
is 0, but not T32 instructions. Signed-off-by: Fredrik Strupe
