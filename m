Ok thanks. I understand and it makes sense to me.

Yes, that would be fine and there is no problem implementing something
like that when we get virtio support in Xen. Today there are still no
virtio interfaces provided by Xen to ARM guests (no virtio-block/net,
etc.)

In fact, in both cases we are discussing virtio is *not* provided by
Xen; it is a firmware interface to something entirely different:

1) virtio is used to talk to a remote AMP processor (RPMesg)
2) virtio is used to talk to a secure-world firmware/OS (Trusty)


VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is not set by Xen in these cases but by RPMesg
and by Trusty respectively. I don't know if Trusty should or should not
set VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM, but I think Linux should still work
without issues.

The xen_domain() check in Linux makes it so that vring_use_dma_api
returns the opposite value on native Linux compared to Linux as Xen/ARM
DomU by "accident". By "accident" because there is no architectural
reason why Linux Xen/ARM DomU should behave differently compared to
native Linux in this regard.

I hope that now it is clearer why I think the if (xen_domain()) check
needs to be improved anyway, even if we fix generic dma_ops with virtio
interfaces missing VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM.
