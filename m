But it is.  I've hit this as well, but haven't attempted a fix.

So we have a parent device, with several sub devices.  The parent
device probes which causes the sub devices to probe.  One of the sub
devices successfully probes, and another fails with EPROBE_DEFER.
This both caused the probe defer framework to immediately schedule
processing the probe defer queue, and also cause all of the chile
devices and the parent device to be removed to probe defer later.
Since the system state doesn't change (one of the sub devices actually
requires an independent other device to have probed), the system ends
up an an infinite probe defer loop.
