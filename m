Hi,

while working on a downstream version of the checkpatch.pl script used for qemu,

I experienced a "bug" that I traced back to the kernel upstream version of checkpatch.pl, and hence the question:

what is the exact meaning of the variable in_commit_log, is it supposed to be including the git diff stats or not?

For example, lets take this sample useless patch as input:

We can see that in the sample patch input we are matching the line

 sound/{ => ac97}/ac97_bus.c | 0

with the regex ($line =~ /\{\s*([\w\/\.\-]*)\s*\=\>\s*([\w\/\.\-]*)\s*\}/

Is this actually wanted?

I would expect that in this case we want instead to match the lines:

rename from sound/ac97_bus.c
rename to sound/ac97/ac97_bus.c

It does not hurt in the kernel, but it does hurt in my downstream patch, where I try to make use of $realfile ,
which is not set if I match too early in the patch. 

Would it make sense to move this chunk earlier:


# Check if it's the start of a commit log                                                                                                   
# (not a header line and we haven't seen the patch filename)                                                                                
                if ($in_header_lines && $realfile =~ /^$/ &&
                    !($rawline =~ /^\s+(?:\S|$)/ ||
                      $rawline =~ /^(?:commit\b|from\b|[\w-]+:)/i)) {
                        $in_header_lines = 0;
                        $in_commit_log = 1;
                        $has_commit_log = 1;
                }

so that the check: 

if (!$reported_maintainer_file && !$in_commit_log

fails for the testcase shown (in_commit_log ends up as true), and the match will happen later, where realfile is set and available for use?

Thanks!

Claudio
