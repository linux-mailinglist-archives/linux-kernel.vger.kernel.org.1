Original report thread is here:

https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make/issues/96

The reporter originally misunderstood the issue and wrongly attributed
it to difference between gettimeofday and clock_gettime but it was
just big jumps between successive vdso clock_gettime64 calls.

No transformation was being done on the output of the vdso function;
as long as it succeeds musl just returns directly with the value it
stored in the timespec. No threads or anything fancy were involved.

Current musl will no longer call it but you should be able to
dlopen("linux-gate.so.1", RTLD_NOW|RTLD_LOCAL) then use dlsym to get
its address and call it (not tested; I've never used it this way).

For musl it was important to disable it asap pending a fix, because
users are expected to generate static binaries, and these could make
it into the wild without anyone realizing they're broken until much
later when run on an affected kernel (especially since pre-5.6 kernels
would hide the issue entirely due to lacking vdso). Ideally a fix will
be something we can detect (e.g. new symbol version) so as not to risk
calling the broken one, but whether that's necessary may depend on
what's affected.

I'm not sure if glibc should do the same; it's not often used in
static linking, and replacing libc (shared lib, or re-static-linking
which LGPL requires you to facilitate to distribute static binaries)
could solve the issue on affected systems.
