Yeah, there is no guarantee and that is fine. Because memory.high is not
about guarantee. It is about a best effort and slowing down the
allocation pace so that the userspace has time to do something about
that.

That being said I would be really curious about how enforcing the
memcg_nr_pages_over_high target works in your setups where you see the
problem. If that doesn't work for some reason and the reclaim should be
more pro-active then I would suggest to scale it via memcg_nr_pages_over_high
rather than essentially keep it around and ignore it. Preserving at
least some form of fairness and predictable behavior is important IMHO
but if there is no way to achieve that then there should be a very good
explanation for that.

I hope that we it is more clear what is our thinking now. I will be FTO
for upcoming days trying to get some rest from email so my response time
will be longer. Will be back on Thursday.
