Hi,

This is the semi-friendly patch-bot of Greg Kroah-Hartman.  You seem to
have sent a nonsensical or otherwise pointless review comment to a patch
submission on a Linux kernel developer mailing list.

I strongly suggest that you not do this anymore.  Please do not bother
developers who are actively working to produce patches and features with
comments that, in the end, are a waste of time.

Patch submitter, please ignore this suggestion, it is not needed to be
followed at all, as the person/bot/AI that sent it is on almost all
Linux kernel maintainer's blacklists and is ignored by them.  Please
feel free to also do the same.

thanks,

greg k-h's patch email bot
