I tried the same Dacapo benchmark as you with different values of
InitialCodeCacheSize and grepped for -e '\[unknown\]' -e '\[JIT\]'.

       Base   Patched
 100M  338    373
 50M   333    315
 25M   323    368
 15M   1238   309
 10M   2600   333
 1M    6035   337

This looks fairly convincing to me: the cliff at 15M is where the code
cache starts needing to be enlarged.

I had a brief look at the async-profiler JVMTI code but I can't see
anything it's doing differently. Their profiler.sh attaches to a running
JVM - I suspect this problem will be less obvious once the JIT has
warmed up.

The compile_info structure is still resource-allocated in
JvmtiExport::post_compiled_method_load() but that function is called
from the service thread not the compiler thread. The compiler thread
just pushes a nmethod* on a queue and the inlining data is recovered
from the nmethod object.

It seems we could extend JVMTI here to pass the code installation
timestamp as another CMLR record type.
