I'm not very familiar with ACPI at all. I've just started to learn
about how it works in the past few months poking at code when I have
some time. So I haven't tried to get this to work with ACPI nor do I
think I'll be able to do that anytime in the near future. I hope that
doesn't block this from being used for DT based platforms.

Yeah, I read that code thoroughly :)

For client drivers, we don't need to do anything. The IRQ apis seem to
already handle -EPROBE_DEFER correctly in this case.

For irqchip drivers, the easy answer can be: Load the IRQ modules
early if you make them modules.

But in my case, I've been testing this with fw_devlink=on. The TL;DR
of "fw_devlink=on" in this context is that the IRQ devices will get
device links created based on "interrupt-parent" property. So, with
the magic of device links, these IRQ devices will probe in the right
topological order without any wasted deferred probe attempts. For
cases without fw_devlink=on, I think I can improve
platform_irqchip_probe() in my patch to check if the parent device has
probed and defer if it hasn't.
