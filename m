Thanks for taking this patch, Peter. I just wanted to double-check if
you considered the race I mentioned in the above paragraph and decided
it's a non-issue. If it is an issue I can send a small follow-up patch
to close the race or I can send a new version of the whole patch with
the fix if that's preferable. Please LMK.
