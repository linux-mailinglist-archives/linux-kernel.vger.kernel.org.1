PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS and PGMIGRATE_FAIL record a combination of different ev=
ents,
so it is not easy to interpret them. Let me try to explain them.

1. migrating only base pages: PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS and PGMIGRATE_FAIL just m=
ean
these base pages are migrated and fail to migrate respectively.
THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS and THP_MIGRATION_FAILURE should be 0 in this case.=

Simple.

2. migrating only THPs:
	- PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS means THPs that are migrated and base pages
	(from the split of THPs) that are migrated,

	- PGMIGRATE_FAIL means THPs that fail to migrate and base pages that fai=
l to migrated.

	- THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS means THPs that are migrated.

	- THP_MIGRATION_FAILURE means THPs that are split.

So PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS - THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS means the number of migrated=
 base pages,
which are from the split of THPs.

When it comes to analyze failed migration, PGMIGRATE_FAIL - THP_MIGRATION=
_FAILURE
means the number of pages that are failed to migrate, but we cannot tell =
how many
are base pages and how many are THPs.

3. migrating base pages and THP:

The math should be very similar to the second case, except that
a) from PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS - THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS, we cannot tell how man=
y are pages begin
as base pages and how many are pages begin as THPs but become base pages =
after split;
b) from PGMIGRATE_FAIL - THP_MIGRATION_FAILURE, an additional case,
base pages that begin as base pages fail to migrate, is mixed into the nu=
mber and we
cannot tell three cases apart.
