To repeat the commit message, the problem is not misaligned
bss..page_aligned objects, but symbols in _other_ bss sections, which
can get allocated in the last page of bss..page_aligned, because its end
isn't page-aligned (maybe it should be?)

bss..page_aligned objects are unlikely to be misaligned, because its
used in C via a macro that includes the alignment attribute, and its
only use in x86 assembly is in head_{32,64}.S which have correct
alignment.

Given that this IDT's page is actually going to be mapped with different
page protections, it seems like allocating the full page isn't
unreasonable.
