I noticed there's a small conflict with another patch that I've queued
up and that I was thinking of sending in for v5.10. This adds a callback
for .irq_retrigger. I don't exactly recall why I needed this, but I've
been carrying that patch locally for a while now. I don't think it's
critical, but there must've been an issue that it fixed. Unfortunately I
seem to have been in a hurry because the commit message is a bit terse.

I can probably just leave that out for now to not further complicated
things, in which case it should be fine to take your patches here into
v5.10 along with the IPI changes. As I already mentioned I'm a bit
unhappy about the needless move of the irq_chip to a global variable,
but I can send out an updated version with those changed back, which is
basically what I have on my local test branch because I had to manually
apply that patch anyway due to the conflict I mentioned above, so
keeping the embedded irq_chip was actually simpler and reduces the diff
a little bit.

The results are in and it's a bit of a mixed bag. I was able to confirm
that Tegra194 also boots again after this series and I'm also able to
resume from sleep using either rtcwake or the power-key as wakeup
source, so the wake-events mechanism is still functional after the
series. I do see a bit of breakage on resume, but none of that seems
related to your patches and is likely something that crept in while we
were looking into the current issue.

Jon had started a job in our test farm in parallel and that came back
with a failing suspend/resume test on Tegra186 (Jetson TX2), but that
seems to have been a pre-existing issue. This was already in linux-next
around next-20200910 and Jon had been investigating it when the boot
failures due to the IPI changes started happening. So I then hooked up
my Jetson TX2 and verified locally that I can properly suspend/resume
using either rtcwake or the power-key as wakeup source, just like I
previously did on Tegra194 (Jetson AGX Xavier). Tegra186 seems to be a
little more unstable because it didn't boot every time for me, but that
is probably not related to this.

I also did a bit of testing on Tegra210 and that seems to also still
work. We cannot test suspend/resume and therefore wake-events there
out-of-the-box because of some long-standing issue with USB refusing
to suspend, but I was able to at least trigger wake-up using the
RTC by first unloading the XUSB driver. It doesn't resume to a fully
functional system, but if I do see it resume, then the wake-event
code must have worked.

So, I'm tempted to say:

Tested-by: Thierry Reding <treding@nvidia.com>

on the series and then we can pick up the other pieces once everything
is back to at least booting.

Thanks again for tracking this down, and apologies for breaking it in
the first place. Let me know if you want me to send the bike-shedded
version of your patches.

Thierry
