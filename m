Isn't that the same for all work performed by the kernel? Instead of
proactive reclaim, it could just be regular reclaim due to a limit,
whose required headroom depends on the workload's allocation rate.

We wouldn't question whether direct reclaim cycles should be charged
to the cgroup. I'm not quite sure why proactive reclaim is different -
it's the same work done earlier.

I see your point, but I don't know how a fixed system-wide pool is
easier to configure if you don't know the constituent consumers. How
much would you set aside?

A shared resource outside the natural cgroup hierarchy also triggers
my priority inversion alarm bells. How do you prevent a lower priority
job from consuming a disproportionate share of this pool? And as a
result cause the reclaim in higher priority groups to slow down, which
causes their memory footprint to expand and their LRUs to go stale.

It also still leaves the question around IO budget. Even if you manage
to not eat into the CPU budget of the job, you'd still eat into the IO
budget of the job, and that's harder to separate out.
