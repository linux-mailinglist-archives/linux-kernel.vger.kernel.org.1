ramoops is too slow for tracing. Honestly, the ftrace functionality in
ramoops should be removed in favor of Nachammai's patches (she did it
for events but function tracing could be trivially added). No one uses
the current ftrace in pstore because it is darned slow. ramoops sits
in between the writing of the ftrace record and the memory being
written to adding more overhead in the process, while also writing
ftrace records in a non-ftrace format. So ramoop's API and
infrastructure fundamentally does not meet the requirements of high
speed persistent tracing.  The idea of this work is to keep the trace
events enabled for a long period time (possibly even in production)
and low overhead until the problem like machine crashing happens.

I agree with the sentiment here on DT. Maybe the DT can be generalized
to provide a ram region to which either ramoops or ramtrace can
attach.
