If having regs frame means having a pt_regs on the stack when procedure 
calls/return, then yes this will probably be the case on most archs (it 
is for arm64 at least.

However in that case, arm64 still builds a stack frame and sets the 
frame pointer, so only handling SP operations doesn't make much sense 
for arm64.

Also, things like ORC_TYPE_REGS_IRET don't have a use for arm64 (but 
maybe for other non-x86 arches it does?)

In the end that's why I left the unwind hint types as arch defined. It 
seems like every arch will have their specific semantics they might want 
to let objtool know about.
