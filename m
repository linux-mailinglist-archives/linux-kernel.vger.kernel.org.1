I can add this for ETM3x as well but I have zero idea regarding
Intel PTs, is there any code in those hwtracing PMUs actually
excluding kernel mode tracing currently?

Sure, this was the minimal change with which I could keep the
check in one place which would work for both sysfs and perf,
but I'll change as you suggested and move the check to
etm4_parse_event_config() and etm4_config_trace_mode() and
return errors properly.

Yes this will not be required as excluding both doesn't make
sense and we print warning in that case already, will drop
this.

Yes will change as explained in above comment.
