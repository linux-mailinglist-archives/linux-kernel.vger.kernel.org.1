I see; thanks for the link.  Sorry I should probably follow up the discussion
and ask the question earlier, anyway...

For what I understand now, IMHO we should still need all those handlings of
FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT like in the initial version.  E.g., IIUC KVM gup will
try with FOLL_NOWAIT when async is allowed, before the complete slow path.  I'm
not sure what would be the side effect of that if fault() blocked it.  E.g.,
the caller could be in an atomic context.

But now I also agree that VM_FAULT_SIGBUS is probably not correct there in the
initial version [1] - I thought it was OK initially (after all after the
multiple fault retry series we should always be with FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY..).
However after some thinking... it should be the common slow path where retry is
simply not allowed.  So IMHO instead of SIGBUS there, we should also use all
the slow path of the locks.  That'll be safe then because it's never going to
be with FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT (FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT depends on
FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY).

A reference code could be __lock_page_or_retry() where the lock_page could wait
just like we taking the sems/mutexes, and the previous SIGBUS case would
corresponds to this chunk of __lock_page_or_retry():

	} else {
		if (flags & FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE) {
			int ret;

			ret = __lock_page_killable(page);
			if (ret) {
				up_read(&mm->mmap_sem);
				return 0;
			}
		} else
			__lock_page(page);
		return 1;
	}

Thanks,
