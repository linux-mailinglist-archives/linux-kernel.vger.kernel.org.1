cancel_work_sync() will either
a) wait until the current work completes, or
b) prevent a new one from starting.

there's no way to really 'abort' a workqueue, 'cancel' means either 
complete or don't start.

if you disable the interrupts then cancel the work, you have a risk of 
not letting the work complete if it already started (case a).

The race is
a) the interrupt thread (this function) starts
b) the work is scheduled and starts
c) the suspend handler starts and disables interrupts in [1] below.
d) the work initiates transactions which will never complete since 
Cadence interrupts have been disabled.

So the idea was that before disabling interrupts, the suspend handler 
changes the status, and then calls cancel_work_sync(). the status is 
also used to prevent a new work from being scheduled if you already know 
the suspend is on-going. The test on the status above is not strictly 
necessary, I believe the sequence is safe without it but it avoid 
starting a useless work.

If you want to follow the flow it's better to start with what the 
suspend handler does below first, then look at how the interrupt thread 
might interfere. The diff format does not help, might be also easier to 
apply the patch and look at the rest of the code, e.g the 3 mask updates 
mentioned below are not included in the diff.
