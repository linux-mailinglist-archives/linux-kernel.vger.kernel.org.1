yes, I agree with you, the pinconf pulls are weak. As this is driven by 
BT SoC (pull on HOST side shouldn't matter), we are not mentioning any 
bias configuration from our side and simply putting it as no-pull, just 
to not conflict in any case. It seems that the rationale mentioned is a 
bit confusing i will change it to clearly specify why we are configuring 
no-pull.

This change is not related to wakeup support, I will make it a separate 
patch, will also mention the details in commit text.

Yes, RTS is either driven high or low. HW flow control is always enabled 
and only turned off when RX FIFO is full. Whereas SW flow control is 
controlled by upper layers(serial core), also it can be enabled/disabled 
from host by calling set_mctrl.

As I understand from your previous comment, pinconf pulls are weak and 
cannot override the pull of controller. Although pull down is 
configured, data will be received only if host controller is ready to 
accept it. So, we want to put RTS in pull-down state(known state) 
instead of leaving it in ambiguous state i.e, no-pull(high/low).
