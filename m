Ah, OK. Actually, on x86 that is not a problem (it can handle recursive int3
if software handles it correctly), but other arch may not accept it.
Hmm, then using NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() is reasonable.

"depends on KPROBES if HAVE_KPROBES" ? :-)

(Anyway, it is a good chance to port kprobe on such arch...)
