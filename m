Dear friend,


Please kindly work with me in this transaction for you will not regret 
it at all.

First of all, I contacted you for us to work in this transaction because 
you are bearing the same last name identity with a deceased customer of 
our bank, therefore I
can present you as the true next of kin to his inheritance fund in our 
bank since myself as his account manager and his personal attorney has 
all his files in our disposal.


I therefore reckoned that you could receive these funds as you are 
qualified by your name identity. All the legal papers will be processed 
and perfected to your name as the deceased true next of kin.

Please kindly get back to me for further details if you are interested 
to work with in this beneficial transaction.

Mr. Ted Sheppe
Commercial Banking
