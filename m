Which means your patch actually passed checkpatch on your computer so my

Markus' patch did not go via GMail.  It was the Broadcom server which
mangled the things.  The email headers:

  Received: by mail.kernel.org (Postfix)
  Received: from rnd-relay.smtp.broadcom.com (rnd-relay.smtp.broadcom.com [192.19.229.170])
          by mail.kernel.org (Postfix) with ESMTPS id D5B3B20702
  Received: from mail-irv-17.broadcom.com (mail-irv-17.lvn.broadcom.net [10.75.242.48])
  Received: from lbrmn-mmayer.ric.broadcom.net (lbrmn-mmayer.ric.broadcom.net [10.136.28.150])
  From: Markus Mayer <markus.mayer@broadcom.com>

Neither kernel.org nor my final server (Gmail) cares about usernames in
From fields of some specific domain.

I guess you could try configure you git send email to use email of
"markus.mayer" while keeping Author "mmayer".  You have to configure git
send email for this and such configuration results in proper two "From"
fields which maybe smtp broadcom won't change.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
