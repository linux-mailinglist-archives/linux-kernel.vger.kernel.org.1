Drive strengths we program here when auto calibration fails are=20
recommended values based on pre-SI circuit analysis and characterized=20
across PVT.

So,=C2=A0 these fail safe values are same for all boards of specific SoC as=
=20
all platform designs follow the design guidelines.

HI Uffe,

Please drop $subject patch. Will send patch that allows parsing for=20
these properties only for SoC where auto cal is enabled as that's where=20
driver needs these properties.

So with this fix, warning will not show up on systems where autocal is=20
not enabled.

Thanks
