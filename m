I would have made this much sooner. Probably before you call
get_page_unless_zero so as to avoid the unnecessary atomic operations.

So one issue with this change is that it is still too late to be of
much benefit. Really you should probably be doing this much sooner,
for example somewhere before the get_page_unless_zero(). Also the
thing that still has me scratching my head is the "Try get exclusive
access under lock" comment. The function declaration says this is
supposed to be a hint, but we were using the LRU lock to synchronize
it. I'm wondering if we should really be protecting this with the zone
lock since we are modifying the pageblock flags which also contain the
migration type value for the pageblock and are only modified while
holding the zone lock.

My concern is that what you can end up with is multiple threads all
working over the same pageblock for isolation. With the old code the
LRU lock was used to make certain that test_and_set_skip was being
synchronized on the first page in the pageblock so you would only have
one thread going through and working a single pageblock. However after
your changes it doesn't seem like the test_and_set_skip has that
protection since only one thread will ever be able to successfully
call it for the first page in the pageblock assuming that the LRU flag
is set on the first page in the pageblock block.

So only one thread really getting to fully use test_and_set_skip is
good, however the issue is that there is nothing to synchronize the
testing from the other threads. As a result the other threads could
have isolated other pages within the pageblock before the thread that
is calling test_and_set_skip will get to complete the setting of the
skip bit. This will result in isolation failures for the thread that
set the skip bit which may be undesirable behavior.

With the old code the threads were all synchronized on testing the
first PFN in the pageblock while holding the LRU lock and that is what
we lost. My concern is the cases where skip_on_failure =3D=3D true are
going to fail much more often now as the threads can easily interfere
with each other.

I plan to do that. I have already been working on a few things to
clean up and optimize your patch set further. I will try to submit an
RFC this evening so we can discuss.

Sorry I had a typo in my comment as well as it is the LRU bit that
will be flickering, not the compound. The goal here is to avoid
clearing the LRU bit unless we are sure we are going to take the
lruvec lock and pull the page from the list.

So actually there is more we could do than just this. Specifically a
few lines below the rcu_read_lock there is yet another PageCompound
check that sets low_pfn yet again. So in theory we could combine both
of those and modify the code so you end up with something more like:

Doing this you would be more likely to skip over the entire compound
page in a single jump should you not be able to either take the LRU
bit or encounter a busy page in __isolate_Lru_page_prepare. I had
copied this bit from an earlier check and modified it as I was not
sure I can guarantee that this is a THP since we haven't taken the LRU
lock yet. However I believe the page cannot be split up while we are
holding the extra reference so the PageCompound flag and order should
not change until we call put_page.
