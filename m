Hi Hugh,

Thanks for comments!

We are the same page here, we all know split_huge_page_to_list could block
them go futher and the code is functionality right.
If the comments 'Split start from PageLRU(head), and ...' doesn't make 
things clear as it's should be, I am glad to see you rewrite and improve
them.

I merge them together on the following git branch, and let the commit log

IIRC, all of comments are accepted and push to 
https://github.com/alexshi/linux.git lruv19
If you don't minder, could you change everything and send out a new version
for further review?

Uh, I updated the testing with some new results here:
