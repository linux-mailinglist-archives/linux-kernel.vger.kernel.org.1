I agree that it might make sense to provide some common mechanism.

My problem with this approach is that it is too generic. Each class
would have different meaning in each subsystem.

It might help to replace any existing variants. But it would be hard
for developers debugging the code. They would need to study/remember
the meaning of these groups for particular subsystems. They would
need to set different values for different messages.

Could you please provide more details about the potential users?
Would be possible to find some common patterns and common
meaning of the groups?

Best Regards,
Petr
