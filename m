Fair enough---if I could get rid of the #PF case I would only be happy.
 But I'm worried about guests being upset if they see non-RSVD page
faults for a page table entry that has one or more reserved bits set.

Understood.

Got it.  My question is: is there an architectural guarantee that the
dirty bit is not set if the instruction raises a page fault?  (And what
about the accessed bit?).

If so, the NPF behavior makes it impossible to emulate lower MAXPHYADDR
values from the NPF vmexit handler.  It would be incorrect to inject a
#PF with the RSVD error code from the NPF handler, because the guest
would not expect the dirty bits to be set in the page table entry.

Even if there's no such guarantee, I would be reluctant to break it
because software could well be expecting it.
