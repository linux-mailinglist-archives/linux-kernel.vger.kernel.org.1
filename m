From userland POV, I've only seen 2 above conversions to be used,
and I have absolutely no idea if the other 2 functions:

static inline __kernel_clockid_t make_process_cpuclock(const unsigned int pid,
static inline __kernel_clockid_t make_thread_cpuclock(const unsigned int tid,

are directly useful from userspace.

Then, I now realize that exporting defines could be a better idea as
their existence could be easily checked from userspace.

However, exporting exactly these defines would likely break existing
userspace due to redefinition, so we probably need to come-up with
different names then.

And then it's probably C library that ideally should provide
corresponding interface to user programs, so there is yet another layer
to be considered?

Personally, I don't feel being experienced enough in kernel-to-userspace
interface subtleties to suggest proper patch that'd expose minimum
details yet doesn't create too much of maintenance burden both in the
kernel and userspace.

Thanks,
