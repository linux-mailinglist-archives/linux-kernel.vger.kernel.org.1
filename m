... and at this point, subsequent readers queue behind the upgrader so we
can't run into the usual "stream of readers prevents forward progress"
issue, which was my initial worry when I started reading the thread. Makes
sense.

I do worry a bit about how much of this we can enforce, but I suppose I'll
wait for the patches. For example, it would nice for
read_lock_to_write_upgrade() to return -EBUSY if there was a concurrent
(successful) upgrade rather than some pathological failure mode like
deadlock, but that feels like it might be a pain to do. It would probably
also be nice to scream if read_lock_to_write_upgrade() is called on a lock
where the upgrade *did* go ahead. Maybe some of this is food for lockdep.

That said, if this all ends up being spelled task_cred_*() then perhaps
it doesn't matter.
