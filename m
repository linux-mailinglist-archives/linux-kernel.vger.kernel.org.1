Some of which are quite broken. And yes, I'm aware of all that, I'm the
one that started swap-over-NFS, which requires network traffic to free
memory, which is one insane step further.

But the way to make that 'work' is carefully account and pre-allocate
(or size the reserve) the required memory to make progress and to
strictly limit concurrency to ensure you stay in your bounds.

The very first thing you need to do is proof your memory usage is
bounded, and then calculate your bound.

The problem is that with RCU you can't limit concurrency. call_rcu()
can't block, you can't wait for a grace period to end when you've ran
out of your reserve.

That is, you don't have a bound, so no reserve what so ever is going to
help.

You must have that callback_head fallback.
