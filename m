Subject: headers_install builds break on a lot of targets?

The headers_install_all target got removed last year (commit f3c8d4c7a728 and
would someone like to update Documentation/kbuild/headers_install.txt which
still describes it?)

The musl-libc maintainer is using a forked hand-hacked kernel header package in
his toolchain build project (https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make), and
he said the reason for it is:

  http://lists.landley.net/pipermail/toybox-landley.net/2020-March/011536.html

  Because downloading 100 MB of kernel source and extracting it to a far
  larger tree just to get the headers isn't really fun.

And I thought "that's why headers_install_all existed", and noticed the target
being removed, so I tried my hand at a small shell script vesion:

  for i in $(echo arch/*/ | sed 's@arch/\([^/]*\)/@\1@g')
  do
    echo $i
    X="$PWD/fruitbasket/$i"
    mkdir -p "$X"
    make ARCH=$i distclean defconfig headers_install \
      INSTALL_HDR_PATH="$PWD/fruitbasket/$i" > /dev/null
  done

On the bright side, the resulting fruitbasket.tar.xz is 1.5 megabytes. The
downside is I have no idea how broken the resulting header files are after this
error-fest:
