I wrote abit about about politics aswell, for fair pay streaming.

It seems my research also goes to a conclusion on schooling, and Uni 
(not unfamiliar?) seems best directed towards Business and Psychology.

I actually had these interests myself, in Business School.

Unix was probably directed towards Uni, and it has ofcourse since gone 
mainstream, and so we separate Uni stuff for Uni, and mainstream 
computing for mainstream.

Serenity!
