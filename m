The driver does check the compatible to determine if DSP loading is 
available for the device.

The driver also checks to see if the firmware file is declared in the DT.

So it has to pass 2 checks to even load and parse the firmware to 
present the controls for the programs and configs.

IMO having a static name is the problem. It is an inflexible design.  
Besides the firmware-name property seems to be used in other drivers to 
declare firmwares for the boards.

But if no one is complaining or submitting patches within the codecs to 
be more flexible with firmware then I can just hard code the name like 
other drivers do.
