From: Dave Hansen <dave.hansen@linux.intel.com>

I went to go add a new RECLAIM_* mode for the zone_reclaim_mode
sysctl.  Like a good kernel developer, I also went to go update the
documentation.  I noticed that the bits in the documentation didn't
match the bits in the #defines.

The VM evidently stopped caring about RECLAIM_ZONE at some point (or
never cared) and the #define itself was later removed as a cleanup.
Those things by themselves are fine.

But, the _other_ bit locations also got changed.  That's not OK because
the bit values are documented to mean one specific thing and users
surely rely on them meaning that one thing and not changing from
kernel to kernel.  The end result is that if someone had a script
that did:

	sysctl vm.zone_reclaim_mode=1

That script went from doing nothing to writing out pages during
node reclaim after the commit in question.  That's not great.

Put the bits back the way they were and add a comment so something
like this is a bit harder to do again.  Update the documentation to
make it clear that the first bit is ignored.
