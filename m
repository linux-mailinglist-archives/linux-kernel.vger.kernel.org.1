Greetings My Dear,

    I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of
health, since I myself are in a very critical health condition in
which I  sleep every night

without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am Mrs.
Monika John  Carlsen from Denmark wife of late Mr John Carlsen, a
widow suffering from

long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband,
the sum of (eleven milliondollars) my Doctor told me recently that I
have serious

sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke
sickness. Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to
a good person
that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a
very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it
for Charity works,

for orphanages, widows and also  build schools for less privileges
that will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote
the word of God and

the effort that the house of God is maintained.

I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death
so I know where

I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not have any child who
will inherit this money after I die. Please I want your sincerely and
urgent answer to

know if you will be able to execute this project, and I will give you
more information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank
account. I am waiting

for your reply.

May God Bless you,
Mrs. Monika John  Carlsen
