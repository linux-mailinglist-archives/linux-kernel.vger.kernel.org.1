V1 upstream submission available from:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1585765499.git.reinette.chatre@intel.com

A notable change since V1 is the inclusion of two additional patches from
Fenghua Yu that introduce the new per-thread MBA feature. These changes are
added to this series because they are small and closely related to the
original submission. The per-thread MBA feature is a hardware advancement
that requires no software interface changes. The patches added just enumerate
the feature and expose it to userspace by showing "per-thread" in the new
resctrl file "thread_throttle_mode" to help user applications fine tune
performance.

There are currently a few resctrl changes outstanding for upstream inclusion.
To support their consideration all outstanding resctrl patches can be
viewed at https://github.com/rchatre/linux.git (branch resctrl/next)

Changes since V1 (also documented within patches to which they apply):
- Rebased on top of James Morse's CDP fix
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200221162105.154163-1-james.morse@arm.com)
- Remove RF_UNINITIALIZED (having uninitialized be represented with ones
  creates too much confusion), replace with an explicit check of rft->fflags
  in rdtgroup_add_files() (Fenghua Yu)
- Rename MBA_THREAD_THROTTLE_MODE to MBA_THROTTLE_MODE_MASK to clarify its
  use as a mask (Tony Luck)
- Introduce explicit MBA_THROTTLE_MODE_MAX instead of implying it is the
  opposite of min and use these values (min and max) explicitly whenever
  testing/setting the throttle mode value (Tony Luck)
- Add __init attribute to thread_throttle_mode_init_intel_rw() and
  thread_throttle_mode_init_intel_ro() since they are only needed during
  initialization (Fenghua Yu)
- Remove MBA_CFG MSR reads and error checking so that the patch is simpler
  and easier to review (Fenghua Yu)
- Ensure CPU hotplug lock is taken when writing register on multiple CPUs (Fenghua Yu)
- Use CPU mask already maintained as part of domains to determine which
  CPUs to update MBA register on (Fenghua Yu)
- Maintain MBA configuration register contents to support use case when not
  all CPUs of a package are online when configuration is set from user
  space
- Use seq_puts() instead of seq_printf() when simple strings are printed
- Set MBA configuration to default when resctrl is unmounted
- Complete rewrite of "thread_throttle_mode" documentation (Tony Luck)
- Remove unnecessary checks on user input (Andy Shevchenko)
- Change code style surrounding usage of sysfs_match_string() (Andy Shevchenko)

From V1 submission:

The first patch in this series introduces a new resctrl file,
"thread_throttle_mode", on Intel systems that exposes to the
user how per-thread values are allocated to a core. This is added in
support of newer Intel systems that can be configured to allocate
either maximum or minimum throttling of the per-thread CLOS values
to the core.

Details about the feature can be found in the commit description and
in Chapter 9 of the most recent Intel ISE available from
https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/c5/15/architecture-instruction-set-extensions-programming-reference.pdf

The first patch parses user input with the appropriate sysfs API that has
not previously been used in resctrl. The second (in V2 the fourth) patch is
added as a subsequent cleanup that switches existing resctrl string parsing
code to also use this appropriate API.

Fenghua Yu (2):
  x86/resctrl: Enumerate per-thread MBA
  x86/resctrl: Enable per-thread MBA

Reinette Chatre (2):
  x86/resctrl: Enable user to view and select thread throttling mode
  x86/resctrl: Use appropriate API for strings terminated by newline
