I had considered doing something similar several months back because one 
of the side effects in the VM is that most of the pages appear to have 
been zeroed by page reporting. However the problem is that in order to 
handle the zeroing case you have to push the flag outside the PageBuddy 
region, and you cannot guarantee that the page is even expected to be 
zeroed since it might have been zeroed before it was freed, so it is 
just adding work of having to clear an extra flag some time after 
allocation.

In addition, unlike madvising the page away there is a pretty 
significant performance penalty for having to clear the page a second 
time when the page is split or merged.
