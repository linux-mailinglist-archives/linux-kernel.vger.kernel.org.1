Thanks Jirka for the review.

Hi Arnaldo,

Andi has a comment regarding a grammar error in the printf message. I 
once plan to apply a fix in the next version. I'm not sure whether you 
will have more comments for this patch set.
If yes, I will wait for the comments.
If not, should I send a V2 patch set with this fixed?
