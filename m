Thanks a lot everyone for figuring this out.

As you mentioned in the issue tracker, the patching was meant as
an optimization and missing it for clock_gettime64 was a mistake but
should by itself not have caused incorrect data to be returned.

I would assume that there is another bug that leads to clock_gettime64
not entering the syscall fallback path as it should but instead returning
bogus data.

Here are some more things I found:

- From reading the linux-5.6 code that was tested, I see that a condition
  that leads to patching out the clock_gettime() vdso should also lead to
  clock_gettime64() falling back to the the syscall after
  __arch_get_hw_counter() returns an error, but for some reason that
  does not happen. Presumably the presence of the patching meant that
  this code path was never much exercised.
  A missing 45939ce292b4 ("ARM: 8957/1: VDSO: Match ARMv8 timer in
  cntvct_functional()") would explain the problem, if it happened on
  linux-5.6-rc7 or earlier. The fix was merged in the final v5.6 though.

- The patching may actually be counterproductive because it means that
   clock_gettime(CLOCK_*COARSE, ...) has to go through the system call
   when it could just return the time of the last timer tick regardless of the
   clocksource.

- We may get bitten by errata handling on 32-bit kernels running on 64-bit
  hardware that has errata workaround in arch/arm64 for compat mode
  but not in native arm kernels. ARM64_ERRATUM_1418040,
  ARM64_ERRATUM_858921 or SUN50I_ERRATUM_UNKNOWN1
  are examples of workaround that are not used on 32-bit kernels running
  on 64-bit hardware.
