Indeed. My initial plan was to change the meaning of temp_get() and
adjust all the users, but there's around a dozen of them and based on my
understanding of the users none of them cared much about such accuracy.

However, I do find having one way to do things appealing, so if there's
a strong preference for it, I'm happy to produce a somewhat more
invasive patch where all users expect millidegrees.
