Fair enough, I just found it weird since it's different to the usual
"disable instrumentation/trace" function annotations.

I would be in favour of that, but I defer to the x86 folks since this
affects them much more than it does me. On the arm64 side, we've got patches
queued for 5.8 that require GCC 10.0.1 or later, and that thing is only a
week old. I think it's reasonable to require a recent toolchain for optional
features like this that inherently rely on compiler support.

At this point, I think that if READ_ONCE_NOCHECK() works as expected, and
calling __{READ,WRITE}_ONCE from functions tagged with __no_sanitize doesn't
result in instrumentation, then we're good.
