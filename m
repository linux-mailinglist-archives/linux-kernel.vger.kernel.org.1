If preferred, we could replace with an enum variable here with some
more context e.g

enum ftr_reg_search {
	FTR_REG_SEARCH_SAFE,
	FTR_REG_SEARCH_UNSAFE,
};

If we really trust the callers, then why BUG_ON() checks are present in
the first place. Because it is always prudent to protect against the
unexpected.

Not sure I got this. Do you mean all the present BUG_ON() are trying to
check that returned arm64_ftr_reg is valid before dereferencing it ? If
there is real trust on the callers that a non present sys_id will never
get requested, then all present BUG_ON() instances should never be there.

Either we trust the callers - drop all BUG_ON() and WARN_ON() instances
or we dont - consolidate BUG_ON() and WARN_ON() instances appropriately.

It consolidates multiple BUG_ON() in various callers which are not really
required. Code consolidation and reduction especially BUG_ON() instances,
is invariably a good thing.

AFAICS in emulate_sys_reg() where the user can send non-present sys_id
registers that eventually gets emulated, should not expect an WARN_ON()
as it did not do anything wrong.

Sure, we could go with an WARN_ON() instead, if acceptable and preferred.
