blk-mq actually has built-in batching(or sort of) mechanism, which is enabled
if the hw queue is busy(hctx->dispatch_busy is > 0). We use EWMA to compute
hctx->dispatch_busy, and it is adaptive, even though the implementation is quite
coarse. But there should be much space to improve, IMO.

It is reported that this way improves SQ high-end SCSI SSD very much[1],
and MMC performance gets improved too[2].

In case of none scheduler, basically nvme driver won't provide any queue busy
feedback, so the built-in batching dispatch doesn't work simply.

kyber scheduler uses io latency feedback to throttle and build io batch,
can you compare i10 with kyber on nvme/nvme-tcp?

Frankly speaking, hardcode 16 #rquests or 64KB may not work everywhere,
and product environment could be much complicated than your sensitivity
tests. If possible, please start with adaptive batching.

50us timeout can be contributed to IO latency, and I'd like to see io latency
data with i10, especially i10 vs. vanilla none.
