Thanks!

Is this really a problem?  I'm not totally familiar with the
timekeeping code, but I know I've used ktime to time things while
interrupts are disabled in the past.  It looks as if things are OK as
long as the base is updated every once in a while and it just does
deltas from there...

Yeah.  I just arbitrarily picked 1 second originally so we didn't loop
infinitely.  The expectation is that we'd never actually hit this
timeout.  If we do then there's (presumably) some type of serious
problem that needs to be debugged.
