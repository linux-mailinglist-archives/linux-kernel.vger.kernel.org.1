i will change it to a pr_debug, as it helps to debug why open() is failing.

In case open() and driver remove() are racing, it helps to prevent use 
after free of udev in open().

This check is not returning error, instead just setting 
filp->private_data = udev; and return 0; It is skipping channel prepare
and queuing of inbound buffers which was done by first open().

In previous patch this was done using separate open reference count and
after removing that i was relying on udev ref count. MHI channel prepare
and buffer allocation for a give channel suppose to happen at open() and
only for first open() call.

Thanks for reviewing my patch series Greg and help making it a better 
driver!
