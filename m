Or just that the page was zeroed far enough in advance that it fell out
of cache naturally.

I know Arjan looked at zeroing on free instead of zeroing on alloc,
and that didn't get merged (or even submitted afaik), so presumably the
results weren't good.

When I was at Microsoft, there was a usecase that made sense, and that
was virtualisation.  If the hypervisor has zeroed the page before giving
it to the guest, then there's no need for the guest to zero it again.
It's already cache hot, and can be given straight to userspace.
