But you could find the messages in the crashdump. Aren't you?

It works this way by "design". The idea is the following:

Taking any locks from NMI context might lead to a deadlock.
Re-initializing the locks might lead to deadlock as well
because of possible double unlock. Ignoring the locks might
lead to problems either.

A compromise is needed:

1. crashdump disabled

   console_flush_on_panic() is called. It tries hard to get the
   messages on the console because it is the only chance.

   It does console_trylock(). It is called after
   bust_spinlocks(1) so that even the console-specific locks
   are taken only with trylock, see oops_in_progress.

   BTW: There are people that do not like this because there
	is still a risk of a deadlock. Some code paths
	take locks without checking oops_in_progress.
	For these people, more reliable reboot is more
	important because they want to have the system
	back ASAP (cloud people).


2. crashdump enabled:

  Only printk_safe_flush_on_panic() is called. It does the best effort
  to flush messages from the per-CPU buffers into the main log buffer
  so that they can be found easily in the core.

  It it pretty reliable. It should not be needed at all once the new
  lockless ringbuffer gets fully integrated,

  It does not try to flush the messages to the console. Getting
  the crash dump is more important than risking a deadlock with
  consoles.
