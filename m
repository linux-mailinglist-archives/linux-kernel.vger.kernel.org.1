I think it's nice to be able to say:

	task_scs(tsk) = task_scs_sp(tsk);

because it makes it very clear that they are initialised to the same thing.
Having it as two statements means somebody will update one and forget to
update the other one.

Hmm, I can't really find anything consistent in that regard, to be honest
with you. Did I miss something in the coding style doc?

I'll leave it as-is for now.
