More to the point, it's never going to help if the pool is empty and one 
allocation is simply larger than the entire thing ;)

Another angle, though, is to question why this driver is making such a 
large allocation with GFP_ATOMIC in the first place. At a glance it 
looks like there's no reason at all other than that it's still using the 
legacy pci_alloc_consistent() API, since every path to that appears to 
have CAN_SLEEP passed as its flag - modernising that would arguably be 
an even better long-term win.
