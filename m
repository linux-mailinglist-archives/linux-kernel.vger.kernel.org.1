Agh ignore me, I somehow failed to sport the ALTERNATIVE().

For my understanding -- my background here is a bit shaky -- the LDAPR
gives us load-to-load order even if there is just a control dependency?

If so (possibly dumb question): why can't we just turn this on
unconditionally?  Is there a significant performance impact?

I'm still confused (or ignorant) though.  If both loads are READ_ONCE()
then switching to LDAPR presumably helps, but otherwise, once the
compiler has reduced the address dependency to a control dependency
can't it then go one step further and reverse the order of the loads?
LDAPR wouldn't rescue us from that.

Or does the "memory" clobber in READ_ONCE() fix that for all important
cases?  I can't see this mattering for local variables (where it
definitely won't work), but I wonder whether static variables might not
count as "memory" in some situations.

Discounting ridiculous things like static register variables, I think
the only way for a static variable not to count as memory would be if
there are no writes to it that are reachable from any translation unit
entry point (possibly after dead code removal).  If so, maybe that's
enough.

That's fair enough, but when there is a consensus it would be good to
see it documented in the code _especially_ if we know that the fix won't
address all instances of the problem and in any case works partly by
accident.  That doesn't mean it's not a good practical compromise, but
it could be very confusing to unpick later on.
