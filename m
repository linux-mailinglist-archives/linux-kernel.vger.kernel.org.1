Yeah, I think -ffreestanding makes sense. It may not be optimal, but
it doesn't smell wrong to me.

I do think maybe we should just remove the generic memcpy and memset
and say "hey people, you really do need to implement your own".

Even if you don't have this "recognize and recurse" issue, you end up
having other issues like just tracing etc. Yeah, we've hopefully
turned everything like that off, but considering that no major
architecture uses this, I wonder how many small details we've missed
with ftrace recursion etc?

Yeah, possibly. Except the kernel almost never uses strnlen for
anything bigger. At least I haven't seen it very much in the profiles.

The "strncpy_from_user()" stuff shows up like a sore thumb on some
loads (lots and lots of strings from user space for pathnames and
execve), but the kernel itself tends to seldom deal a lot with any
longer strings.  Stuff like device names etc, I  guess, but any time I
see string handling in profiles, it tends to be in user space (GNU
make spends all of its time in string handling, it sometimes seems).

Of course, that may be just me looking at very particular profiles, so
maybe I've just not seen the loads where the kernel strnlen matters.

memcpy and memset? Those matter. A lot.
