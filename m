The ultimate solution is the offload of printk console handling to
kthreads. I know that it takes ages to get it in. But it will
also take ages to go around all the cyclic dependencies.

People tend to use printk() anywhere. And any lock taken by
printk() is prone to cause these problems.

We have tried to go around this in the scheduler code by
printk_deferred() and it was never-ending story. I believe
that the port->lock related cycles are another never-ending
story. And attempts to shuffle locks are always complicated
and error-prone. They require deep understanding of the affected
code paths. The approach with printk_deferred() has been pretty
safe at least.

Another approach might be to teach lockdep to remove lock chains
that were taken during the system initialization and will never
happen again. Or something like this.

I still believe that this is a false positive. Console that is being
initialized can't be used by printk() at the same moment. Locks taken
only when the console is being initialized can't cause deadlocks
when the fully initialized console is registered later.

Petr
