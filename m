Fair enough. I wasn't aware str_has_prefix() was __always_inline.

Sure, I fully understand you are not the one proposing these changes.

But if the pattern in question is so common, couldn't we go one step
further and define something like

static inline const u8 *skip_prefix_or_null(const u8 *str, const u8 *prefix)
{
}

which returns a pointer into the original string, or NULL if the
prefix is not present.

The current patch as proposed has no benefit whatsoever, but even the
meaningful alternative you are proposing is not actually an
improvement, given that it is not self-explanatory from the name
'str_has_prefix' what it returns, and so the code becomes more
difficult to understand.
