I agree with this. I have no doubt that it could be done, technically,
but at the same time this is code that would have to run very early on
and therefore would have to be built-in. So even if that's just a couple
of hundred lines of code, it still means that we'd need that couple of
hundred lines of code for potentially each platform supported by a given
multi-platform kernel, and that's quickly going to add up.

So I think transporting this knowledge in device tree is a fair
compromise. The bootloader knows exactly whether the display hardware
was left active, so it's easy to update the device tree accordingly
before passing it to the kernel and it allows us to use generic code to
perform this quirking.

For Tegra specifically I'm not even sure this would work on all
generations. For example on Tegra186, the BPMP provides access to
clocks, resets and powergates. So the BPMP is needed to determine
whether or not the display hardware is active (you need to query clocks,
resets and powergates before accessing registers, because accessing
registers of an unclocked, in-reset or powergated hardware block
crashes). However, the BPMP is also typically behind the SMMU, so that
would make for a nice cyclic dependency.
