Yes, this would make the API much more reliable. But it is not completely
easy. It has been discussed several times. The most serious attempt
is https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1541165517-3557-1-git-send-email-penguin-kernel@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp/#t

lockdep.c is probably the most complicated pr_cont() user. The
conversion complicated the code a bit, see
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1541165517-3557-3-git-send-email-penguin-kernel@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp/

Linus also wanted to have an API to flush part of the message
before some action and finalize it later. It would be usable
for things like:

	pr_info("Doing something dangerous... ");
	printk_flush();
	do_dangerous_thing();
	pr_cont("ok\n");

Where pr_cont() would allow to flush part of the message to the
consoles and add the end of the line later when it did not crash.

It would need some support in the lockless ring buffer API anyway.
But it is only nice to have from my POV.

Also this was discussed several times. The most acceptable solution
was to use "small" buffer on the stack (128 bytes or so).

You are right. The buffering is really good step. It would make
the API sane and reliable. It has been proposed and discussed many
times. The main obstacle was that there was no volunteer to get this
done. If you are able to do so, it would be amazing.

I am just not sure what is more complicated. Getting lockless
operation correctly is always tricky. But going though 2000
callers individually is also a lot of work.
