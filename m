Maybe it is also interesting to mention that the initial Gabriel's
patches version was introducing the emulation trigger by specifying a
flag for memory region through mprotect(), so we could mark the regions
calls from which should be trapped. That would be probably the easiest
possible solution in terms of using that in Wine (as no memory allocated
by Wine itself is supposed to contain native host syscalls) but that
idea was not accepted. Mainly because, as I understand, such a
functionality does not belong to VM management.
