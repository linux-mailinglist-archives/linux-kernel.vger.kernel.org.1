Because without LTO, the compiler cannot see all the pointers all at
the same time due to their being in different translation units.

But yes, if the compiler could see all the pointer values and further
-know- that it was seeing all the pointer values, these optimizations
could happen even without LTO.  But it is quite easy to make sure that
the compiler thinks that there are additional pointer values that it
does not know about.

Because ignorant compilers are safe compilers!  ;-)
