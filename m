Ah, that's interesting, thanks for the details. So you have one DMA 
transfer and the data from the previous and next track are provided in 
consecutive bytes in a ring buffer, but at the DSP level you have a 
switch that will feed data for the previous and next tracks into 
different decoders, yes?

If that is the case, indeed the extension you suggested earlier to 
change the profile is valid. You could even change the format I guess.

To avoid confusion I believe the capabilities would need to be extended 
so that applications know that gapless playback is supported across 
unrelated profiles/formats. The point is that you don't want a 
traditional implementation to use a capability that isn't supported in 
hardware or will lead to audio issues.

looks like it indeed.

right, but the key point is 'switch between streams'. That means a more 
complex/capable implementation that should be advertised as such to 
applications. This is not the default behavior assumed initially: to 
allow for minimal implementations in memory-constrained devices, we 
assumed gapless was supported with a single decoder.

Maybe the right way to do this is extend the snd_compr_caps structure:

/**
  * struct snd_compr_caps - caps descriptor
  * @codecs: pointer to array of codecs
  * @direction: direction supported. Of type snd_compr_direction
  * @min_fragment_size: minimum fragment supported by DSP
  * @max_fragment_size: maximum fragment supported by DSP
  * @min_fragments: min fragments supported by DSP
  * @max_fragments: max fragments supported by DSP
  * @num_codecs: number of codecs supported
  * @reserved: reserved field
  */
struct snd_compr_caps {
	__u32 num_codecs;
	__u32 direction;
	__u32 min_fragment_size;
	__u32 max_fragment_size;
	__u32 min_fragments;
	__u32 max_fragments;
	__u32 codecs[MAX_NUM_CODECS];
	__u32 reserved[11];
} __attribute__((packed, aligned(4)));


and use a reserved field to provide info on capabilities, and filter the 
set_codec_params() addition based this capability - i.e. return -ENOTSUP 
in 'traditional' implementations based on a single 'stream'/decoder 
instance.
