Makes sense.

yup

I am not completely sure how often newline is used in common messages.
I hope that it is more frequently used in a debug code that has to
dump many details.

If my assumption is correct then your proposed approach should be well
acceptable. Normal people will not notice. Developers should be able
to deal with it, especially when a reasonable output might be seen
on consoles, via dmesg or crashdumnp.

Anyway, the proposal looks fine to me. I hope that it will work :-)
Let's continue the discussion when you send the patchset.

Best Regards,
Petr
