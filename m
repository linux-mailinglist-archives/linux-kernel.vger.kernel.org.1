I know that Matthew and me raised it. We do can handle it without
introducing any flag. I mean just use 0 as argument to the page_alloc(gfp_flags = 0) 

i.e. #define __GFP_NO_LOCKS 0

so it will be handled same way how it is done in the "mm: Add __GFP_NO_LOCKS flag"
I can re-spin the RFC patch and send it out for better understanding.

Does it work for you, Michal? Or it is better just to drop the patch here?
