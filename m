+Schemes
+-------
+
+For usual DAMON-based data access awared memory management optimizations, users
+would simply want the system to apply a memory management action to a memory
+region of a specific size having a specific access frequency for a specific
+time.  DAMON receives such formalized operation schemes from user and applies
+those to the target processes.
+
+Users can get and set the schemes by reading from and writing to ``schemes``
+debugfs file.  To the file, each of the schemes should represented in each line
+in below form:
+
+    min-size max-size min-acc max-acc min-age max-age action
+
+Bytes for size of regions (``min-size`` and ``max-size``), number of monitored
+accesses per aggregate interval for access frequency (``min-acc`` and
+``max-acc``), number of aggregate intervals for age of regions (``min-age`` and
+``max-age``), and predefined integer for memory management actions should be
+used.  ``madvise()`` system call with specific hint are currently available.
+The numbers and their representing memory hint are as below::
+
+    0   MADV_WILLNEED
+    1   MADV_COLD
+    2   MADV_PAGEOUT
+    3   MADV_HUGEPAGE
+    4   MADV_NOHUGEPAGE
+
+You can disable schemes by simply writing empty string to the file.  For
+example, below commands applies a scheme saying “If a memory region larger than
+4 KiB (4096 0) is showing less than 5 accesses per aggregate interval (0 5) for
+more than 5 aggregate interval (5 0), page out the region (2)”, check the
+entered scheme again, and finally remove the scheme.::
+
+    # cd <debugfs>/damon
+    # echo "4096 0 0 5 5 0 2" > schemes
+    # cat schemes

+DAMON-based Operation Schemes
+-----------------------------
+
+The ``schemes`` subcommand applies given data access pattern based operation
+schemes to the given target processes.  The target processes are described
+using the command to spawn the processes or pid of running processes, as
+similar to that of ``record`` subcommand.  Meanwhile, the operation schemes
+should be saved in a text file using below format and passed to ``schemes``
+subcommand via ``--schemes`` option.
+
+    min-size max-size min-acc max-acc min-age max-age action
+
+The format also supports comments, several units for size and age of regions,
+and human readable action names.  Currently supported operation actions are
+WILLNEED, COLD, PAGEOUT, HUGEPAGE, and NOHUGEPAGE.  Each of the actions works
+as same to that of madvise() system call.  Below is an example schemes file.
+Please also note that 0 for max values means infinite.::
+
+    # format is:
+    # <min/max size> <min/max frequency (0-99)> <min/max age> <action>
+    #
+    # B/K/M/G/T for Bytes/KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB
+    # us/ms/s/m/h/d for micro-seconds/milli-seconds/seconds/minutes/hours/days
+    # 'null' means zero for size and age.

+    # if a region keeps a high access frequency for more than 100ms, put the
+    # region on the head of the LRU list (call madvise() with MADV_WILLNEED).
+    null    null    80      null    100ms   0s      willneed

+    # if a region keeps a low access frequency for more than 200ms and less
+    # than one hour, put the # region on the tail of the LRU list (call
+    # madvise() with MADV_COLD).

+    # if a region keeps a very low access frequency for more than 1 minute,

+    0B      null    0       10      60s     0s pageout

+    # if a region of a size bigger than 2MiB keeps a very high access frequency
+    # for more than 100ms, let the region to use huge pages (call madvise()
+    # with MADV_HUGEPAGE).
+    2M      null    90      99      100ms   0s hugepage

+    # If a regions of a size bigger than 2MiB keeps small access frequency for

+
+For example, you can make a running process named 'foo' to use THP for memory
+regions keeping 2MB or larger size and having very high access frequency for
+more than 100 milliseconds using below commands::
+
+    $ echo "2M null 90 99 100ms 0s hugepage" > my_thp_scheme
