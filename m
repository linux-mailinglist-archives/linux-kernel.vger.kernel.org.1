Yes it has come up before, you can find details in below links.

Rob Clark can add more details on this probably for the GPU faults.
As for the reliability, downstream kernel(I mean kernels with which 
android
devices with QCOM chipsets are shipped) has stalling enabled for a long 
time
now and has been stable in the field. So we can say that we are safe 
with
this enabled in QCOM implementation.

Yes, I will fixup this in the next version.

We could have our own context fault handler in QCOM implementation,
but that would just be duplicating things from arm-smmu context fault
handler. So I did not think it makes much sense to have our own
fault handler in qcom impl just for enabling stall model.
