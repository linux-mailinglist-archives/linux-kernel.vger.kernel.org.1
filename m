I also prefer we don't add anything now before DFL spec is updated.

The idea of extending the DFLv0 is good, but I'm not sure if it is necessary
now. It depends on how the customer is using the card, are they
developing more FME features themselves on current cards and want to make
them public.

I think we could discuss about the strategy. And we could add another
patchset if we finally decide and update the DFLv0 spec.
