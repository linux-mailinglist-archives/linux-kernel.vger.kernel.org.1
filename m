I see.

So, can't you simple use them as is? I still didn't get how SIZE helps here.

The problem here that .driver_name is a part of user visible
interface, so, when you rename it it will affect the module alias.
How DEV_NAME is shared? It should not be, otherwise it will collide
with other drivers.

Legacy drivers are not the best example to take. So, if you can
survive without UART type, please go with it. Otherwise commit message
should point out why it's needed so eagerly.

Rather consider to use xArray API.

Yes.

Less LOCs is good (but keep common sense applied).

See above. This ID is a part of UAPI which is kinda redundant nowadays.
You need to provide a good argument for that. Otherwise, get rid of it.
