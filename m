More context please.  Without the log messages preceding this one we 
can't tell whether the device is using the usb-storage driver or the 
uas driver.

Also, what makes you think the driver is setting the SHORT_NOT_OK flag
at the wrong time?  In fact, how can there be a wrong time?  
SHORT_NOT_OK is a valid flag to use with any control or bulk URB.
