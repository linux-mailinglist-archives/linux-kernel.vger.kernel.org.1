Excellent, and I suppose the arch callback should be changed to share
code with arch_build_bp_info(), which Lai was extending here:

That'd be great; because where we're going getting this wrong is
insta-fail.

Another point to look at is the whole dbg_is_early; I suspect that's
similarly wrecked, the entry code isn't more robust early on.
