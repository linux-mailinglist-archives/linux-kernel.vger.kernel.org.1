For background: on arm64 we wanted to use DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS since
we already have to use that to handle pointer authentication, and didn't
want to gain more ways of implementing ftrace.

Arguably we should move the dependency into the arm64 Kconfig for
ARCH_SUPPORTS_SHADOW_CALL_STACK.

Hmm... how does KREPROBES work? If you can only mess with the return
address when probing the first instruction in the function, it'll just
work for SCS or pointer authentication, as the LR is used at that
instant. If KRETPROBES tries to mess with the return address elsewhere
it'd be broken today...

Can BPF mess with return addresses now!?

Thanks,
Mark.
