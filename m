Right, I believe it was tested, I just wonder if it was tested on a
phone vs. a laptop.  A phone is almost constantly waking up to deal
with stuff (which is why my phone battery barely lasts till the end of
the day).  Phones also usually have some type of self refresh on their
panels so they can be suspended even when they look awake which means
even more constant wakeups.  A laptop (especially without panel self
refresh) may have very different usage models.  I'm trying to confirm
that this setting is appropriate for both classes of devices or if it
has been only measured / optimized for the cell phone use case.
