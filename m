If this is even possible to begin with, doing this in a way that is
portable across the various linkers that we claim to support is going
to be tricky.

I suppose this is the downside of using partially linked objects as
our module format - using ordinary shared libraries (along with the
appropriate dynamic relocations which are mostly portable across
architectures) would get rid of most of the PLT and trampoline issues,
and of a lot of complex static relocation processing code.

I know there is little we can do at this point, apart from ignoring
the permissions - perhaps we should just defer the w^x check until
after calling module_frob_arch_sections()?
