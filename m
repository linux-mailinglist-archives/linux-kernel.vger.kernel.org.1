Sorry for jumping in. We can rely on preemptable() for sure, if CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT
is enabled, something like below:

if (IS_ENABLED_RT && preemptebale())

Also i have a question about pcp-lists. Can we introduce and use all allowed 
MIGRATE_PCPTYPES? If called with GFP_RT_SAFE? If not please elaborate.
According to my tests it really helps when it comes to: succeed(return the page) or NULL.
Because on of the list of below types:
 MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE,
 MIGRATE_MOVABLE,
 MIGRATE_RECLAIMABLE,

can have a page making allocation succeed.

Thanks!
