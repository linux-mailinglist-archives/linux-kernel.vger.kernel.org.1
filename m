Changing the link is fine, but could we also add a line to make it clear
which version of spec was written against, e.g.

| This code is up-to-date with version DEN 0028 A

... as that was previously implicit in the documentation link, and it
makes clear what the code is aware of and what it is trying to handle.
Iknow we'll have to update it periodically, but I think that's
worthwthile.

With that:
