Given what I said in the other thread, Clang really _should_ allow
the MCR/MRC et.al. instructions to access the VFP registers.  There
is no reason to specifically block them.

As we have seen with FPA, having that ability when iWMMXT comes along
is very useful.  In any case:

1. The ARM ARM (DDI0406) states that "These instructions are MRC and MCR
instructions for coprocessors 10 and 11." in section A7.8.

2. The ARM ARM (DDI0406) describes the MRC and MCR instructions as
being able to access _any_ co-processor.

So, Clang deciding that it's going to block access to coprocessor 10
and 11 because some version of the architecture _also_ defines these
as VFP instructions is really not on, and Clang needs to be fixed
irrespective of these patches - and I want to know that *is* going to
get fixed before I take these patches into the kernel.
