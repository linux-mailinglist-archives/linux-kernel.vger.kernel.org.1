I have no idea what a "PCH" is, what "IOM" is, and how any of this
relates to a "SoC" :)

Don't impose arbritrary hardware "splits" to kernel code when the kernel
has no such "partitioning" please.

That sounds like a firmware issue you can solve in UEFI.

I think this is the most TLA-laden email I have ever written, and I used
to work at IBM :)
