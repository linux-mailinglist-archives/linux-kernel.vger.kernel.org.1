Ultimately, yes I think I am suggesting replacing this API with the 
runtime pm API.

As near as I can tell, if I'm a device driver on some other bus, and I 
want to keep my device alive because I'm doing a DMA to it or something, 
I would call pm_runtime_get(), and when I have confirmation my activity 
is done, I would use pm_runtime_put().

As near as I can tell, this is already plumbed into the bus framework, 
such that the MHI bus would get a callback when the device driver does 
that.  In the MHI bus callback, you would be able to route the request 
as needed.

So, with this API (that has no consumers currently), I call 
pm_runtime_get() and also mhi_device_get()?
