Yeah, it would be possible. But I would prefer to start with something
simple. We could always make it more complicated when people
complains.

This extra metadata are not currently read by crashdump tools.
It should be much easier to change them at least in the near future.

I know but they are currently used only for subsystem and device names.

I tried to find what are the longest subsystem and device names. They
are limited already now by the buffer for formatting the dictionary in
dev_printk_emit():

	char hdr[128];

and create_syslog_header() prints a warning when the buffer is not
enoung:

	dev_WARN(dev, "device/subsystem name too long");

Google has shown only one syscaller report with this error message,
see
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/001a113a36724a053a0562f93c05@google.com/


First, dev_WARN() looks like an overhead. Simple printk() should
be enough. Anyway, this type of error is not a reason for panicing
the system.

Second, I believe that limit device name to 48 characters should
work well in practice. Note that it is not clear how many people,
if any, is using the journalctl filtering. And shrinked device name
should be better than missing one.


I personally would prefer to replace the dict ring with the array.
Bot solutions are not fully reliable. But the array is easier
and we would need it for the timestamps, cpu number, and maybe
some other metadata anyway.

We could always add the dict ring back again when there is
a good use for it.
