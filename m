First, I'd suggest running this paragraph through 'fmt'.  That way you
don't have to care about line lengths.

Second, this paragraph doesn't really explain what I need to know to
understand the meaning of these numbers.  When Linux attempts to migrate
a THP, one of three things can happen:

 - It is migrated as a single THP
 - It is migrated, but had to be split
 - Migration fails

How do I turn these four numbers into an understanding of how often each
of those three situations happen?  And why do we need four numbers to
report three situations?

Or is there something else that can happen?  If so, I'd like that explained
here too ;-)
