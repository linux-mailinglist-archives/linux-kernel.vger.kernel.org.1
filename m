Yes, it certainly feels like the right way to do it, and it would
not affect other archs in a functional way. It would however introduce
a subtle change for s390 behavior on _all_ page table walkers, not
just the READ_ONCE gup_fast path, i.e. it changes the level at which
the pointer iteration is done. Of course, that *should* not have any
functional issues, or else it would also be broken in gup_fast, but
in this area we often were wrong with should / could assumptions...

At least it could have some (minor) performance impact on s390,
due to going up to pgd level again instead of staying at the
folded level, but only for crossing pud/p4d boundaries, so that
*should* be neglectable.

So, while totally agreeing that adding the pXd parameter to
pXd_addr_end() in general looks like the cleanest way, we will at
least need to give this some proper testing on s390.

One other question that came up here while doing that generalized
approach was "how to submit it", i.e. should it be split up in
multiple patches which might be cleaner, or have it all-in-one,
which would simplify Fixes/stable tags. After all, we must not forget
that this fixes a severe data integrity issue on s390, so we don't
want to unnecessarily complicate or defer backports for that.

That being said, maybe a compromise could be to split it up
in a way that first introduces the pXd_addr_end_folded()
helpers for gup only, with proper Fixes/stable tags? Then
do the generalization with more thorough testing for s390
after that, possibly also with Fixes/stable tags so that we
do not have different code in stable and upstream?
