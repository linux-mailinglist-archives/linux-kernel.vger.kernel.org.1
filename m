Ah, so you're on big.LITTLE type of system. I have done some work which enables
biasing RT tasks towards big cores and control the default boost value if you
have util_clamp and schedutil enabled. You can use util_clamp in general to
help with DVFS related response time delays.

I haven't done any work to try our best to pick a small core first but fallback
to big if there's no other alternative.

It'd be interesting to know how often you end up on a big core if you remove
the affinity. The RT scheduler picks the first cpu in the lowest priority mask.
So it should have this bias towards picking smaller cores first if they're
in the lower priority mask (ie: not running higher priority RT tasks).

So unless you absolutely don't want any RT tasks on a big cores, it'd be worth
removing this affinity and check the percentage of time you spend on little
cores. This should help with your worst case scenario as you make more cpus
available.

So if you set commit_work to sched_set_fifo(), it'd be at a reasonably high
priority (50) by default. Which means you just need to manage your SF
priorities without having to change commit_work priority itself?

I don't really mind. But it seems better for me if we know that two kernel
threads need to have a specific relative priorities to each others then to
handle this in the kernel properly. Userspace will only need then to worry
about managing its *own* priorities relative to that.

Just seen Peter suggesting in another email to use SCHED_DEADLINE for vblank
work. Which I think achieves the above if commit_work uses sched_set_fifo().

If you ever get a chance to run a high network throughput test, it might help
to see if softirqs are affecting you. I know Android has issues with this under
some circumstances.

If you meant sched_deadline + token approach, then yeah I think it'd be better.
But as you said, we can't do this yet :/

But as Peter pointed out, this doesn't mean you can't use SCHED_DEADLINE at all
if it does make sense.
