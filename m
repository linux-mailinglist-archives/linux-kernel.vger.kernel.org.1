Eventually we may get the compilers to do this. But adding even more
ifdefs and Kconfig variables to check which combinations of things
work is getting out of hand. :-/ So if we can make the below work
would be great.

Very good. Yes, UBSan inlines the check and the __ubsan_handle
functions are just to generate the report.
