But which one is an i2c_driver? All the sub devices are platform drivers
and there should be no need for them to know that they are behind an
i2c driver (or spi driver or just mmio). All they have to know is how
to access the registers.

Where is the code which enumerates the children?

I don't mean they can't do it, I mean, I'm calling 
of_platform_populate()
myself. But who is actually calling it when one uses the this patch
series?
