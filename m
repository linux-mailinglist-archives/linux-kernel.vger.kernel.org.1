This sounds alright to me with one slight problem. I am doing this
work for an embedded arm64 SoC, so controlling everything via device
tree is preferable compared to having some settings via device tree
and others via kernel parameters, especially because the kernel
parameters are hardcoded by firmware that we try not to update too
often for uptime reasons.

I agree, amoops.dump_oops should be depricated with or without
max_reason change.

OK. Should we remove max_reason from struct kmsg_dumper and also
remove the misleading comment about kmsg_dump_reason ordering?

Thank you,
