But this regulator is only used for the eMMC there, which we apparently
don't have on the Cubieboard 7?

If there are not even referenced in the .dts, then fixed regulators are
rather pointless. So yes, please remove this vcc-3v1 one.

What is the story with the other regulator? Is there a PMIC or a power
switch for the SD card? Or is the power supply actually hardwired?
