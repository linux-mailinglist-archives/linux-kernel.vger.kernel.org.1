When we enter into fadump crash path via system reset we fail to update
the pstore.

On the system reset path we first update the pstore then we go for fadump
crash. But the problem here is when all the CPUs try to get the pstore
lock to initiate the pstore write, only one CPUs will acquire the lock
and proceed with the pstore write. Since it in NMI context CPUs that fail
to get lock do not wait for their turn to write to the pstore and simply
proceed with the next operation which is fadump crash. One of the CPU who
proceeded with fadump crash path triggers the crash and does not wait for
the CPU who gets the pstore lock to complete the pstore update.

Timeline diagram to depicts the sequence of events that leads to an
unsuccessful pstore update when we hit fadump crash path via system reset.

            Race: crash triggered before pstore
                  update completes

To avoid this race condition a barrier is added on crash_fadump path, it
prevents the CPU to trigger the crash until all the online CPUs completes
their task.

A barrier is added to make sure all the secondary CPUs hit the
crash_fadump function before we initiates the crash. A timeout is kept to
ensure the primary CPU (one who initiates the crash) do not wait for
secondary CPUs indefinitely.

Chanagelog:

v1 -> v3:
   - https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/linuxppc-dev/2020-April/208267.html

v3 -> v4:

   - Now the primary CPU (one who triggers dump) waits for all secondary
     CPUs to enter and then initiates the crash.

v4 -> v5:
    - Fixed a build failure reported by kernel test robot <lkp@intel.com>
      Now the cpus_in_crash variable is defined outside CONFIG_CMA
      config option.
