I am very sorry. I was hoping that this series could be considered for
inclusion into v5.8 and submitted it seven weeks ago because of that.
The recent feedback addressed seemed to be the final few small comments
needed to be ready for inclusion and I was afraid that waiting long to
address this would cause me to miss opportunity to be considered for
inclusion since we are already at rc6.
