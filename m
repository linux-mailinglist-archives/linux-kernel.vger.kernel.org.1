Subject: [RFC PATCH 1/2] sparc64: remove mm_cpumask clearing to fix kthread_use_mm race
Date:   Tue, 18 Aug 2020 13:34:04 +1000

The de facto (and apparently uncommented) standard for using an mm had,
thanks to this code in sparc if nothing else, been that you must have a
reference on mm_users *and that reference must have been obtained with
mmget()*, i.e., from a thread with a reference to mm_users that had used
the mm.

The introduction of mmget_not_zero() in commit d2005e3f41d4
("userfaultfd: don't pin the user memory in userfaultfd_file_create()")
allowed mm_count holders to aoperate on user mappings asynchronously
from the actual threads using the mm, but they were not to load those
mappings into their TLB (i.e., walking vmas and page tables is okay,
kthread_use_mm() is not).

io_uring 2b188cc1bb857 ("Add io_uring IO interface") added code which
does a kthread_use_mm() from a mmget_not_zero() refcount.

The problem with this is code which previously assumed mm == current->mm
and mm->mm_users == 1 implies the mm will remain single-threaded at
least until this thread creates another mm_users reference, has now
broken.

arch/sparc/kernel/smp_64.c:

    if (atomic_read(&mm->mm_users) == 1) {
        cpumask_copy(mm_cpumask(mm), cpumask_of(cpu));
        goto local_flush_and_out;
    }

vs fs/io_uring.c

    if (unlikely(!(ctx->flags & IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL) ||
                 !mmget_not_zero(ctx->sqo_mm)))
        return -EFAULT;
    kthread_use_mm(ctx->sqo_mm);

mmget_not_zero() could come in right after the mm_users == 1 test, then
kthread_use_mm() which sets its CPU in the mm_cpumask. That update could
be lost if cpumask_copy() occurs afterward.

I propose we fix this by allowing mmget_not_zero() to be a first-class
reference, and not have this obscure undocumented and unchecked
restriction.

The basic fix for sparc64 is to remove its mm_cpumask clearing code. The
optimisation could be effectively restored by sending IPIs to mm_cpumask
members and having them remove themselves from mm_cpumask. This is more
tricky so I leave it as an exercise for someone with a sparc64 SMP.
powerpc has a (currently similarly broken) example.
