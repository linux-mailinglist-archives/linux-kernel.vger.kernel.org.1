The state from the previous wrap always have to have DESC_FINAL_MASK set.
Do I miss something, please?

How is this supposed to work please?

If the ID is exactly one wrap behind, it is being reserved but the new
it was not written yet. In this case, DESC_FINAL_MASK is already set.
The above cmpxchg will not do any change. And prb_reserve() will not
be able to distinguish that it has been finalized.

A solution would be to write the new id here. But then it will be
needed to detect this in prb_reserve().

It is possible that it already works this way. But I do not see it.
I haven't had a coffee yet.


I am really not sure what solution is better. Mine have more barriers.
But this brings many new combinations that need to be checked and
handled. Sigh.
