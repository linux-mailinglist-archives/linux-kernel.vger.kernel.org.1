Well, I don't see anything immediately wrong with it, at least. Not
that that means much...

Although in addition to the normal-page path and the transhuge path,
you'll probably also have to make the same change in the hugetlb path.
I guess you may have to grep through all the uses of FOLL_WRITE, as
Linus suggested, to see if there are any other missing spots.
