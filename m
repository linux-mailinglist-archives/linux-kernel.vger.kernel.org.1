Thanks, I'll fix that up.

Thanks.

I can fix up all those, but out of interest how did you "know" the
right three digit identifier to use?

This was suggested from someone testing the original spi_lpc.c code on
a macbook, I can remove it for now and work out if it's incorrect
later.

I'm really wondering if drivers/mfd/lpc_ich.c is the right place for
this kind of "just expose one byte of PCI config space" functionality.
Certainly drivers/platform/x86/intel_spi_lpc.c is much simpler, and
would also allow me to do some of the chipsec tests in the future --
for instance if BIOSWE is unset but BLE is set, try setting BIOSWE and
check that SMM clears it back.

It's one char ('1' or '0') plus '`\0` -- no?

Sure, that's a good idea. I know BIOS is a badword now, so how about
just "firmware"? so /sys/kernel/security/firmware/bioswe

I will look, I don't think the actual value is terribly important. The
only time I can trigger this is forgetting to remove the securityfs
file in module unload, and then trying to re-insert the module --
which failed with -EEXIST from memory.

No, that doesn't work.

Can fix, thanks.
