Andrew, please drop Yu Zhao's
mm-use-add_page_to_lru_list-page_lru-page_off_lru.patch
from the mmotm tree.

Yu wants to replace it by this cleanup series, and he has graciously
agreed to rebase his series on top of Alex Shi's per-memcg lru_lock
series; but mm-use-add_page_to_lru_list-page_lru-page_off_lru.patch
is getting in the way of adding them to mmotm.  The three of us are
all hoping that Alex's v19 series can go into mmotm when the merge
window closes, then I'll review Yu's series rebased on top of it.

Thanks,
Hugh
