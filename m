Well, we should analyse this.

I think we did it for flatmem initially (on arm32) and added support for
sparsemem later on, so free_unused_memmap() had to cope with sparse
sections. On arm64 we introduced vmemmap support and didn't bother with
the freeing at all because of the added complexity of the vmemmap page
tables.

I wonder whether we should just disallow flatmem and non-vmemmap
sparsemem on arm64. Is there any value in keeping them around?

But if we changed SECTION_SIZE_BITS in the mainline kernel, then we
wouldn't need additional code to free the unused memmap.
