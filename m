Native default build (defconfig) on arm64 does not throw this warning.
I guess this came up with 'make W=n' or something. Anyways if this is
indeed an issue, we will have to add in helpers for each HWCAP arrays
which will fetch a feature string on index value to be used in c_show
(arch/arm64/kernel/cpuinfo.c). I wanted to avoid this to reduce code.

Sure, will respin this later probably after 5.8-rc1.
