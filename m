will update with your suggestion. Thanks!

All suggestions are taken! Many thanks for so detailed review!
A new branch with all comments is updated as 
    https://github.com/alexshi/linux.git lruv19.5

A quick summary for the branch,
Add a new patch for move_pages_to_lru:
	mm/vmscan: remove lruvec reget in move_pages_to_lru
Add another patch for split part from 'Introduce TestClearPageLRU':
 	mm/swap.c: reorder __ClearPageLRU and lruvec

the mlock changes moved earlier:
	mm/mlock: remove __munlock_isolate_lru_page
	mm/mlock: remove __munlock_isolate_lru_page

I am wondering if it's good to send out v19 here or maybe better to wait
for your confirm if all suggestion/comments are settled?

Thanks
Alex
