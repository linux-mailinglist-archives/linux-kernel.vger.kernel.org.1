Ok, let's drop that patch then and make sure we do something that
everyone is happy with later on. I'm already in favor of adding
a more reliable soc_device instance based on this, but we need to
be sure we don't screw up the contents of the attributes when we
can't change them later.

I want a fix for that, as I hope we can eventually turn this warning on by
default and stop playing whack-a-mole when they come up. Most of these
warnings are harmless, but occasionally the prototypes don't match exactly
and cause real bugs depending on the configuration, and ensuring both
sides include a common header file is an easy way to make it work
more reliably.

Note that the warning should come up for either W=1 or C=1, and I also
think that
new code should generally be written sparse-clean and have no warnings with
'make C=1' as a rule.
