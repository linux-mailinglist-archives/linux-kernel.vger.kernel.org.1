I've grabbed patch 1, cheers.

I'm also keen to fix it up but, although I roughly know how it works, I
always fail to find the time to spend on it. :-|

I understand where you're coming from, but I also think it's a reasonably
narrow viewpoint. If you disable IRQs during a step, you can change the
behaviour of the instruction being stepped. For example, an MRS of DAIF
will now see the I bit set instead of clear, and so something like
irqs_disabled() could go wrong while being stepped. But I think the main
realisation is that instructions being stepped can generate exceptions for
other reasons too, for example if you try to step a BUG() or a get_user().
Not only does that mean that we have to deal with exceptions during a step,
but it also means that disabling interrupts is a pretty bad idea because
the exception context may rely on them being enabled (for example, if it has
to sleep while handling a page fault).

Although I appreciate somebody sending patches to improve this logic,
I really worry that it just moves the problem around and it won't be long
before somebody else sends another set of patches trying to deal with the
fallout. That ends up being a waste of everybody's time.

Sure, and I see you as Mr KGDB in this area anyway, but that's an important
user of this infrastructure (esp. single-step).

I'm fairly set on unmasking IRQs during step for the reasons I mention
above. The question is really whether or not to forcibly prevent preemption
during such an irq.
