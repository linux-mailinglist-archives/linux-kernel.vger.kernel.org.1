Perhaps the solution is not to imply "res" is "errno", but pass it as
a separate "errno" field.  Then only include "errno" in the audit
message when it isn't zero.  This assumes that some audit messages for
the same audit number include errno, while others do not.

With this solution, the existing integrity_audit_msg() could become a
wrapper for the new function.
