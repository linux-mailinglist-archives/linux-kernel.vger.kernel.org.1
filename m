My previous understanding was that although COW is always safe, we should still
avoid it when unnecessary because it's still expensive.  Currently we will do
enforced COW only if should_force_cow_break() returns true, which seems to be a
good justification of when to ask for the enforcement.

How about squashing below comments into the patch?

Userfaultfd-wp should not care about this because it's not a write operation,
so we don't need to capture it.  We should only trigger uffd-wp when the COWed
page got written later again either by a real write gup or a write #pf.

This is a good question anyway...  Because I totally forgot to check the other
part of the COW logic to keep the UFFD_WP bit properly during COW.  Without
that extra change in wp_page_copy() we could potentially lose uffd-wp bit when
there's enforced COW on read-only gups.

Moreover, I definitely missed some special handling for huge pages too here and
there.  As a summary of above...

... I think I'll squash these into v2:
