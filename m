From your last email, when you run -rc4 with revert of 568f27006577, you
can observe list corruption easily.

So can you enable KASAN on -rc4 with revert of 568f27006577 and see if
it makes a difference?

Looks you enable lots of other debug options, such a lockdep, which has
much much heavy runtime load. Maybe you can disable all non-KASAN debug
option(non-KASAN memory debug options, lockdep, ...) and keep KASAN
debug only and see if you are lucky.
