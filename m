How about something like this for the commit log?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, rcu_cpu_starting() checks to see if the RCU core expects a
quiescent state from the incoming CPU.  However, the current interaction
between RCU quiescent-state reporting and CPU-hotplug operations should
mean that the incoming CPU never needs to report a quiescent state.
First, the outgoing CPU reports a quiescent state if needed.  Second,
the race where the CPU is leaving just as RCU is initializing a new
grace period is handled by an explicit check for this condition.  Third,
the CPU's leaf rcu_node structure's ->lock serializes these checks.

This means that if rcu_cpu_starting() ever feels the need to report
a quiescent state, then there is a bug somewhere in the CPU hotplug
code or the RCU grace-period handling code.  This commit therefore
adds a WARN_ON_ONCE() to bring that bug to everyone's attention.

Let's leave at least the WARN_ON_ONCE() indefinitely.  If you don't
believe me, remove this code in your local tree, have someone give you
several branches, some with bugs injected, and then try to figure out
which have the bugs and then try to find those bugs.

This is not a fastpath, so the overhead of the check is not a concern.
Believe me, the difficulty of bug location without this check is a very
real concern!  ;-)

On the other hand, I fully agree with the benefits of documenting the
design rules.  But is this really the best place to do that from the
viewpoint of someone who is trying to figure out how RCU works?

							Thanx, Paul
