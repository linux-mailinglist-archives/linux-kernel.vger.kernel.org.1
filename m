Hmm, I see.

Technically there's also __isolate_free_page() using ALLOC_CMA for watermark
check, but it's shared by compaction and alloc_contig_range(), so we can't just
remove ALLOC_CMA from there. It's probably not worth to complicate it though. If
we pass compaction_suitable() without ALLOC_CMA and then reach
__isolate_free_page() and meanwhile watermarks changed so we wouldn't pass
without ALLOC_CMA anymore, it should be rare hopefully and not cause us deplete
non-CMA free pages too badly.

But I've only now also realized how dynamic setting cc->cma is. So in case a
zone consists mostly of CMA blocks, removing ALLOC_CMA in
__compaction_suitable() would be actually wrong and prevent compaction from
doing any work? Sigh. Any idea about that?

That will be much better. Can't wait, then :)

Nit: probably reverse this as the second test is cheaper?
