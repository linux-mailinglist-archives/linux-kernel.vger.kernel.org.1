If I'm understanding the i915 code, this is only the case for modeset
commits?  I suppose we could achieve the same result by just deciding
to pick the kthread of the first CRTC for modeset commits.  I'm not
really so much concerned about parallelism for modeset.

The problem with wq is prioritization and SCHED_FIFO userspace
components stomping on the feet of commit_work.  That is the entire
motivation of this series in the first place, so no we cannot use
unbound wq.
