I tried to imagine a negative impact for this hw_ptr_jiffies update when the 
DMA position is not updated from the driver and I haven't found any so far.

Let's apply this and we'll see in future :-)

And yes, the patch description should be improved (DMA ptr is not updated / 
streaming is inactive).
