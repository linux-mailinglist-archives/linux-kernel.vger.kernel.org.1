There seems to be two replicators back to back here. What is connected
to the other output of both of them ? Are there any TPIUs ? What happens
if you choose a sink on the other end of "swao_replicator" (ETB ?)

After boot, what do the idfilter registers read for both the replicators ?


I believe we need to properly assign the TRACE_IDs for tracing sessions,
(rather than static ids) in a way such that we could filter them and use
the multiple sinks in parallel for separate trace sessions and this is
not simple (involves kernel driver changes and the perf tool to be able
to decode the trace id changes too).


So for the moment, we need to :

1) Disallow turning the replicator ON, when it is already turned ON
2) Do what your patch does. i.e, disable the other end while one end
    is turned on.

Thoughts ?

Kind regards
Suzuki
