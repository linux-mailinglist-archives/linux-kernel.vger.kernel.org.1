I looked at those blocking bug list sent by Dmitry. I wonder =E2=80=9Cboys=
, why they
did=E2=80=99t send those out earlier to linux-next or somewhere more =
visible?=E2=80=9D because
I had dealt with most of those before, and I knew the solutions to =
unblock them!

Even though my testing setup is somewhat different from syzbot. I =
don=E2=80=99t do
fuzzers, and my config is only focus on mm, iommu and a few core kernel =
pieces
with more debugging options on, but it does bare-metal and multi-arch, =
there are
still lots of opportunities to help each other with dealing with =
blocking issues.

A few things I am doing differently with syzbot on linux-next where =
would help to
be run continuous without blocking most of the time are,

I don=E2=80=99t set panic_on_warn. I=E2=80=99ll deal with warnings =
afterwards.

Occasionally, there are hard failures that I have to deal with right =
now. I=E2=80=99ll get to
the end of it, and figured out the exact commit caused it.

In syzbot mode, the bisection (by robot) is the hard part, because if =
you don=E2=80=99t
figure out the exact commit, most of times people (CC by the bug =
reports) would
have no clue and will be ignored. (even if the bad commit was figured =
out, it is
not 100% guaranteed developers would know what=E2=80=99s going on but it =
helps
dramatically, and at least we can revert it without blocking if =
everything else fails).

Thus, it would be really help if syzbot (or human operators) could help =
bisect, even
if it could only figure out one of merge commit in linux-next is bad =
(where with high
accuracy) and may get those ignored less.=
