That's a very old kernel, you are going to have to get support for that
from the vendor you bought it from :(

Of course, how would that work?

What type of flow control are you using?

Are you using flow control?

usb-serial devices are totally different and send data to the host in a
completly different way.

Your hardware might just not be able to handle really high baud rates at
a continous stream, what baud rate were you using?

And again, this is what flow control was designed for, please use it.

Again, different interrupt and protocols being used for the USB stuff.
