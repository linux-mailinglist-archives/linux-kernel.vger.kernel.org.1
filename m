Good points!  I will use pidfd for this purpose, instead.

BTW, 'struct damon_task' was introduced while DAMON supports only virtual
address spaces and recently extended to support physical memory address
monitoring case by defining an exceptional pid (-1) for such case.  I think it
doesn't smoothly fit with the design.

Therefore, I would like to change it with more general named struct, e.g.,

    struct damon_target {
            void *id;
            struct list_head regions_list;
            struct list_head list;
    };

The 'id' field will be able to store or point pid_t, struct mm_struct, struct
pid, or anything relevant, depending on the target address space.

Only one part of the address space independent logics of DAMON, namely
'kdamon_need_stop()', uses '->pid' of the 'struct damon_task'.  It will be
introduced by the next patch ("mm/damon: Implement region based sampling").
Therefore, the conversion will be easy.  For the part, I could add another
callback, e.g.,

    struct damon_ctx {
            [...]
            bool (*is_target_valid)(struct damon_target *t);
    };

And let the address space specific primitives to implement this.

Then, damon_get_task_struct() and damon_get_mm() will be introduced by the
sixth patch ("mm/damon: Implement callbacks for the virtual memory address
spaces") as a part of the virtual address space specific primitives
implementation.

I gonna make the change in the next spin.  If you have some opinions on this,
please let me know.


Thanks,
