Yes, and I have since expanded the comment above the data_push_tail()
while loop to mention that:

	/*
	 * Loop until the tail lpos is at or beyond @lpos. This condition
	 * may already be satisfied, resulting in no full memory barrier
	 * from data_push_tail:C being performed. However, since this CPU

	 * the reusable state must already be visible.

Great catch! This could trigger the WARN_ON at desc_reserve:F and lead
to prb_reserve() unnecessarily failing.

It could cause dropped messages.

This is the common case, since most records will not have dictionary
data.

Agreed. For my next version I am folding all smp_mb() and smp_wmb()
calls into their neighboring cmpxchg_relaxed(). This would apply here as
well, changing desc_push_tail:B to a full cmpxchg().

We still need the full memory barrier at data_push_tail:C. Readers rely
on it to be able to verify if their copied data is still valid:

CPU0 (writer0)        CPU1 (writer1)       CPU2 (reader)
                                           desc_read->committed
desc_make_reusable
smp_mb
data_push_tail
                      read new data tail
                      data_push_head
                      smp_mb
                      write new data
                                           read garbage new data
                                           desc_read->reusable
