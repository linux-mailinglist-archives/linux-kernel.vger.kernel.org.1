There is no relationship between MFD and Regmap.  It is not more
closely related to Regmap than it is any other public API provided
within the kernel.  *Some* parent drivers initialise one large,
encompassing Regmap address space and pass it to their children, but
this isn't suitable in all cases.

Remember, not all use-cases are the same.  Just because your H/W fits
well within the current framework, doesn't mean all will.

Initialising in the parent is no problem if the driver is meaningful
in other ways, but what if that's all the parent driver does?  In
these cases Syscon can be used instead, rendering the driver
superfluous. Meaning it can (and *should*) then be omitted.

Not sure I understand the problem.

Could you explain why the current implementation doesn't work for you?

Open coding your own implementation of Syscon is non-optimal.

Syscon is just a means to obtain a group of registers either a)
without a dedicated driver OR b) to share amongst more than 1,
potentially unrelated, user.  So in the case of a) which appears to
sit well with-in your use-case and expectations, you are correct.
Whereas in the case of b) you are not.

I hope that helps clarity the situation somewhat.
