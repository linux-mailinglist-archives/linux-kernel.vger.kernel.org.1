Yes this is compared to SMT disabled, I'll improve the commit message.

With SMT enabled and no core scheduling, it is around 40ms in the higher
percentiles. Also one more thing I wanted to mention, this is the 90th
percentile.

Glad you like it! The metric is calculated with a timestamp of when the
driver says the key was pressed, up until when the GPU says we've drawn
pixels in response.

The test requires a mostly only requires Chrome browser. It opens some
pre-existing test URLs (a google doc, a window that opens a camera stream and
another window that decodes video). This metric is already calculated in
Chrome, we just scrape it from
chrome://histograms/Event.Latency.EndToEnd.KeyPress.  If you install Chrome,
you can goto this link and see the histogram.  We open a Google docs window
and synthetically input keys into it with a camera stream and video decoding
running in other windows which gives the CPUs a good beating. Then we collect
roughly the 90th percentile keypress latency from the above histogram and the
camera and decoded video's FPS, among other things. There is a test in the
works that my colleagues are writing to run the full Google hangout video
chatting stack to stress the system more (versus just the camera stream).  I
guess if the robots can somehow input keys into the Google docs and open the
right windows, then it is just a matter of scraping the histogram.

Yes it is specifically a ChromeOS running on a pixel book running a 7th Gen
Intel Core i7 with 4 hardware threads.
https://store.google.com/us/product/google_pixelbook

I could try to make it a synthetic test but it might be difficult for a robot
to run it if it does not have graphics support and a camera connected to it.
It would then need a fake/emulated camera connected to it. These robots run
Linux in a non-GUI environment in qemu instances right?

thanks,
