Hi Yang,

Right, but any eventual promotion path would allow this to subvert the 
user mempolicy or cpuset.mems if the demoted memory is eventually promoted 
to a DRAM node on its socket.  We've discussed not having the ability to 
map from the demoted page to either of these contexts and it becomes more 
difficult for shared memory.  We have page_to_nid() and page_zone() so we 
can always find the appropriate demotion or promotion node for a given 
page if there is a 1:1 relationship.

Do we lose anything with the strict 1:1 relationship between DRAM and PMEM 
nodes?  It seems much simpler in terms of implementation and is more 
intuitive.

This is an important decision to make, I'm not sure that we actually 
*want* all of these NUMA APIs :)  If my memory is demoted, I can simply do 
migrate_pages() back to DRAM and cause other memory to be demoted in its 
place.  Things like MPOL_INTERLEAVE over nodes {0,1,2} don't make sense.  
Kswapd for a DRAM node putting pressure on a PMEM node for demotion that 
then puts the kswapd for the PMEM node under pressure to reclaim it serves 
*only* to spend unnecessary cpu cycles.

Users could control the memory placement through a new mempolicy flag, 
which I think are needed anyway for explicit allocation policies for PMEM 
nodes.  Consider if PMEM is a zone so that it has the natural 1:1 
relationship with DRAM, now your system only has nodes {0,1} as today, no 
new NUMA topology to consider, and a mempolicy flag MPOL_F_TOPTIER that 
specifies memory must be allocated from ZONE_MOVABLE or ZONE_NORMAL (and I 
can then mlock() if I want to disable demotion on memory pressure).
