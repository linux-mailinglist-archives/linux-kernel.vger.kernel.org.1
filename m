Subject: [PATCH v3 0/8] dt-bindings: calxeda: Convert bindings to json-schema

Hi,

this is the DT schema bindings conversion part of the v2 Calxeda update
series. The .dts part was already merged, so this tackles what is left.

This series converts the "prose" DT binding documentation for various
devices used by the Calxeda platform to the json-schema format, so that
the automatic checking actually does something useful.
After those patches "make dtbs_check" comes back clean for the two .dts
files in the kernel, and "dt_validate -m" reports only those three
not-covered nodes (on Highbank, only the last one on Midway):
arm,cortex-a9-twd-timer
arm,cortex-a9-twd-wdt
calxeda,hb-sdhci
The first two are generic ARM devices, for which the binding doc just
does not have been converted yet. The SDHCI controller is actually
disabled in the DTs, and the SD slot is populated on very few special
systems only, also there has never been a driver in the kernel for
this device anyway.

Verified by trying to break every single assumption the bindings make
(in their example section): the tooling complained correctly.

Thanks,
Andre

Changelog:
v2 ... v3:
- adjust license to name both BSD and GPL
- add missing address specifier for clock nodes' names
- properly group phandle properties in SATA bindings example
- use itemised interrupt description in l2ecc binding
- limit reg-shift in the IPMI binding
- allow device_type property in IPMI binding

v1 ... v2:
- Remove unneeded property type from clocks and sgpio-gpio
- add additionalProperties: false to bindings missing it before
- limit number in "phydev" to the hardware constraint of 5 bits
- add required: properties to l2ecc binding
- fix enumeration of compatible strings in calxeda-ddr-ctrlr
