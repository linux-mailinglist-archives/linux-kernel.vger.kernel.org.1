Hmm, can't you instead change dequeue_huge_page_node_exact() to test the PF_
flag and avoid adding bool skip_cma everywhere?

I think that's what Michal suggested [1] except he said "the code already does
by memalloc_nocma_{save,restore} API". It needs extending a bit though, AFAICS.
__gup_longterm_locked() indeed does the save/restore, but restore comes before
check_and_migrate_cma_pages() and thus new_non_cma_page() is called, so an
adjustment is needed there, but that's all?

Hm the adjustment should be also done because save/restore is done around
__get_user_pages_locked(), but check_and_migrate_cma_pages() also calls
__get_user_pages_locked(), and that call not being between nocma save and
restore is thus also a correctness issue?
