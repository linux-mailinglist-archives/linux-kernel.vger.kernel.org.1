I don't know if Andreas had something else in mind, but there's actually a
RISC-V specific reason we _do_ need this: the 64-bit time_t conversion.
Essentially what happened is that I screwed up by merging the rv32 Linux port
before the rv32 glibc port.  As part of the rv32 upstreaming process we
realized that it would be better in the long term to just drop the 32-bit
time_t support from the kernel, but at that point we already had the Linux UABI
defined.

We ended up changing the user ABI on 32-bit systems as of d4c08b9776b3 ("riscv:
Use latest system call ABI").  We didn't have any rv32 userspace at that time
(and we still don't have glibc or any Linux capable hardware), so we figured it
would be OK to break the rules and change the ABI.  The obvious result is that
32-bit userspace won't work with old kernels, so I'd assumed this was being
used to quickly sanity check the kernel.

Andreas would know better than I do, though, as  I don't really do much glibc
stuff any more.
