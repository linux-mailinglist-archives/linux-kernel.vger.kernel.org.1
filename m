Yes, it is definitely more understandable way to say it. Do you mind
if I rephrase it as:

"It is also stashed off and then later compared with enclave PTEs to
ensure that any future mmap()/mprotect() operations performed by the
enclave creator or requested the enclave by itself (e.g. by issuing
ECLU[EMODPE]) are consistent with the earlier declared permissions."

I'd just mention EMODPE as an example, but I'm also perfectly fine
leaving that out :-) Not a big deal for me.

Also, should there be commas, i.e. ", or requested the enclave by
itself,"? I suck with English comma rules.

OK, so we are probably talking about [1] here, right?

There are at least two checks done with and without the callback:

A. TCS pages are required to be passed with zero EPCM permissions,
   the reason being that CPU will silently overwrite its permissions
   zero. This check resides in sgx_validate_secinfo() [2].
B. noexec partitions are unconditionally disallowed. This check
   resides in __sgx_encl_add_page() [2].

TCS pages are funky in the way that they are also required to be
mapped as RW. OK, then you might argue that why not just require
RW as ioctl supplied permissions. That would cause a mismatch with
CPU calculated MRENCLAVE and one calculated to SIGSTRUCT. I've
written in past quite length explanation of this to the kdoc
of sgx_ioc_enclave_add_pages() [2].

This was something that I did not find from Sean's response.

To encompensate all this information in a paragraph, I'd write along
the lines of

"ioctl(fd, SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_ADD_PAGES, ...) checks for every page that
Thread Control Structure (TCS) pages are always added with zero
permissions and no pages are sourced from noexec partitions. TCS pages
are pages that work as entry points to the enclave. This is the basic
acceptance criteria for any enclave page before it gets mapped.

After finishing this, the ioctl will project the enclave permissions to
the corresponding VMA permissions and stores the result for later
lookup.  For regular pages this is an identity mapping but as an
exception TCS pages are unconditionally mapped as RW VMA permssion even
though their enclave permissions are zero. This required by the ISA.

This information will be used by sgx_mmap() and sgx_vma_protect() to
enforce that higher permissions than the projected permissions will
not be used by checking this for each every page in the address
range.

By doing this, we give assets for LSM's to make decisions during the
build time based on projected VMA permissions and the source VMA
(either a file or anonymous mapping) that hold when the enclave is
finally mapped to the visible memory."

Is this sufficient?
