Wrong. Grsecurity is violating the Linux Copyright by preventing 
redistribution, by adding additional terms between it and distributees. 
It does not matter if Linus, the weak faggot, is "never going to 
include" it.

Grsecurity is violating the GCC copyright for the same reason.

It doesn't FUCKING matter what the "INDUSTRY" is doing or wants.
You techies are FUCKING FAGGOTS. YOU own the COPYRIGHT to whatever you
"contributed" to Linux (you never signed over your copyrights). It does
N O T matter what your fucking "bosses" in "DUH INDUSTRY" want you to
do or do not want you to do. YOU can and HAVE TO SUE.

I hate you fucking people for your inaction. You're like a hive mind of 
weak castrated scum.
'DURR OUR 'peer' ARE AGAINST IT SO WE CAN DO NOTHING' - White Tech 
__FAGGOTS__

I just hate you people.
You just let it happen.
Then you cope "well, we weren't going to include it anyway".

Additionally:Linus, for years, induced others to assist him in his work 
on his kernel, by claiming that those who violated the share-and-share 
alike provisions of the license would be sued.

He explained AT LENGHT the "deal": you contribute code, if anyone 
modifies it they cannot close the code, if they violate that they will 
be sued. This is what he told his supporters and those who helped him.

A reasonable person would surmise that Linus was making a promise to sue 
violators of the Linux Kernel License.

INSTEAD: He is paid 1.3 million dollars per year, and does not say a 
word. (What is he being paid for? We can guess: To forgo the legal right 
to sue? To NOT encourage suits? To DISCOURAGE suits?)

That is: The linux kernel contributors detrimentally relied on Linus' 
words: his false promise of action.

Yes: he should be punished. They would not have done the programming 
work without those false statements of Linus'
