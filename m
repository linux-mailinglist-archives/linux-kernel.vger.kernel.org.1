Ah OK, good to know.

And any particular reasons it can't exist in the same node. And also are
they talking to different SCMI firmware implementation meaning different
location in the system. The reason I ask is we have notion of one platform
with agent id = 0 as per the specification. It can be split in terms
of implementation and can have some side band communication amongst
themselves but can't have agent ID other than 0. It violates specification.

I don't have issues split it into 2 or more SCMI device as long as it
doesn't provide notion of existence of multiple SCMI platform firmware
implementations with different agent ID.

Also Cristian has posted patches to support custom protocols[1]. It would
be good if you can take a look/review/test/comment...

I still don't see strong reasons for splitting it. Also by above I assume
you still have one SCMI server/platform implementation and just different
types of transport for std vs custom protocol and all sorts of such combo.
I think we deal with that as long as they are of same transport type like
mailbox or smc.

We have something called fastchannels for that. Your scmi perf protocol
can present those registers in those fastchannels if they are MMIO.
If they are system registers, then you need not use scmi at all for CPU
DVFS and still need one SCMI device for all other needs.

Good point. I was worried if we need to create another workqueue for
something else in the future.

Indeed, which I tried but don't like.

For now, we can have as is in your patch. We can address this if and
when we create another workqueue in scmi
