In a nutshell, the driver needs our patch that implements
cryptographic policy management.

A patch that:

1.) Does not change the default behavior of the driver.

2.) Implements capabilities that are consistent with what the hardware
was designed to do, but only at the discretion of the platform owner.

3.) Has no impact on the driver architecture.

The only consumer for this driver are SGX runtimes.  To our knowledge,
there exist only two complete runtime implementations, Intel's and
ours.  It us unclear why our approach to the use of the technology
should be discriminated against when it doesn't impact the other user
community.

The Linux kernel that I have worked on and supported since 1992 has
always focused on technical rationale and meritocracy rather then
politics.  We would be interested in why our proposal for the driver
fails on the former grounds rather then the latter.
