No, we don't.  As ever we have no idea if there ever will be consumers -
we don't know what drivers the system is going to load, we don't know
what the intentions of the OS and system integration are and we have
zero idea why the system is in the state it's in.

None of the issues around this have *anything* to do with individual
drivers, all this is doing is forcing us to go through and add this to
every single driver which doesn't accomplish anything.  Regulator
drivers have no role in this, they don't set policy, so there is no
reason why they should be aware of any of this.

Please go and look at the previous discussions of this topic, this needs
to work for other users as well.
