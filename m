Aaargh! You are right!

You are right. The smp_rmb (data_make_reusable:B) and its following tail
check are not needed. Since data_make_reusable:A can read garbage even
if we pass the tail check, we might as well always allow garbage and
rely on the descriptor/lpos checks to catch it. (Actually, that was the
design!)

However, the pairing smp_mb (data_alloc:A) is still needed, but it will
then pair with data_push_tail:A. If data_make_reusable() reads garbage
(maybe newly written garbage), it is important that a new data tail is
visible.

The comment for data_alloc:A would change to something like:

	/*
	 * Guarantee any updated tail lpos is stored before modifying
	 * the newly allocated data area. Another context may be in
	 * data_make_reusable() and is reading a block ID from this
	 * area. data_make_reusable() can handle reading a garbage block
	 * ID value, but then it must be able to load a new tail lpos.
	 * This pairs with data_push_tail:A.
	 */
	smp_mb(); /* LMM(data_alloc:A) */
