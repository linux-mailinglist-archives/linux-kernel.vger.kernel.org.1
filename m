Seeing the config register has got a few other CPU parameters to tune
I meant to have both syscon and syscon-less compatible nodes supported
For the same reason there is "allOf" with "syscon.yaml" reference above.

This P5600 CM2 L2-Cach RAM setting is a part of the Baikal-T1 System
Control Module, in particular the register lives someplace amongst Clock
Control Unit and System-specific settings. Seeing the clock and
system-specific parameters are almost always redistributed to a
dedicated registers set, in my first System Control Module DT node design
I was going to split the functionality up into the dedicated sub-nodes.
If there are some mixed parameters declared in the corresponding
registers set, I marked these nodes with additional "syscon". I
thoroughly described that design in RFC: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/3/22/393
sent To: you.

Seeing there are others indirectly related to the System Controller DT node
design issues I've been addressed in the framework of other patchsets, I
also suggested an alternative design in that RFC text. So should you have
any comments, please send your response right there. I am currently in a bit
of frustration, since noone has sent any comments to the RFC, which stops me
from moving on with fixing the patchsets issues. Though I am pretty sure,
that the alternative design would be better accepted by you and community,
so if no comments pop up in the RFC soon, I'll start implementing it.
The alternative solution "/* System Controller DT Nodes II */" in the
RFC includes having a common "syscon"-compatible node representing the
Baikal-T1 System Controller, while sub-nodes like Clocks Control Units and this
L2-cache RAM control block would import a regmap from that "syscon"
(using a standard syscon_node_to_regmap()-like method). This will solve a
multiple issues raised in others patchsets and the problem you noted here.

Please also note, that following Arnd Bergmann suggestion, I'll move
this driver to the drivers/memory subsystem. So the binding file will be
also moved to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/memory-controllers.
Similarly the ehb-drivers and bindings will be moved to the drivers/bus
and Documentation/devicetree/bindings/bus/ directories respectively.

Ok. I'll do this to the next example case as well.
