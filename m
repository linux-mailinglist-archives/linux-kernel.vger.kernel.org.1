Sorry, this did register at the time, I just felt that it's a bit 
redundant to give a review tag to say "yes, this is exactly what I 
suggested" :)

That said, I do wish I hadn't forgotten about the dev_notice message 
level, but I think that lies over in the conceptual purity corner rather 
than making any practical difference, so I'm still OK with the patch 
as-is. Will?

Robin.


p.s. whoever has this entry in their address book for the IOMMU list 
(Doug?):

"list@263.net:IOMMU DRIVERS <iommu@lists.linux-foundation.org>, Joerg 
Roedel <joro@8bytes.org>," <iommu@lists.linux-foundation.org>

it really messes up Thunderbird's ability to generate working headers 
for a reply ;)
