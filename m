When I learned about R-B trees in my algorithms class decades ago, I
distinctly remember the text book saying something about how the red
and black names were meaningless. Just know that the nodes are
different in how you go about sorting or injecting a new node into the
tree. So yes, it could have been blue and yellow, or 1 and 0, or Bob
and Alice. The colors were just a way of labeling in order to
differentiate the two types of nodes, and I am not worried that people
are going to take offense to them.
