The left line is the data being passed by the callbacks; the right line
is the callbacks being registered via the counter_register function.

This chart might be better represented as two separate charts: I was
attempting to show how "Counter core" is used simply to register the
callbacks for "Counter sysfs" and "Counter chrdev", whereafter the
callbacks are called directly by those components when needed without
passing through "Counter core" again.

These defines are needed by userspace for the character device
interface, but I see your point that at this point in the patchset they
don't need to be exposed yet.

I could create temporary include/linux/counter_types.h to house these
defines, and then later move them to include/uapi/linux/counter.h in the
character device interface introduction patch. Do you think I should do
so?

I switched to fixed-width types after the suggestion by David Laight:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/5/3/159. I'll CC David Laight just in case he
wants to chime in again.

Enum types would be nice for making the valid values explicit, but there
is one benefit I have appreciated from the move to fixed-width types:
there has been a significant reduction of duplicate code; before, we had
a different read function for each different enum type, but now we use a
single function to handle them all.

Good eye! Looks like I mistakenly squashed an unrelated (and obsolete)

> Why using const on value types here? This isn't really done much in the

Over the course of this patchset develop, these value types ocassionally
became pointer types (and vice versa) and other such changes in the
callback interface. These const qualifiers help me make sure I'm not
mistakening trying to set these values, and other similar common errors.

Since this is a static function that won't be exposed to the rest of the
kernel, I don't see much harm in leaving these qualified as const in
this driver. Although, if others do see these qualifiers as too
confusing, then I'll remove them for the sake of readability.

The mutex code was merged in after the development of this code, so I
missed this error. Thanks, I fix this.

Good idea, I'll do that instead.

I think it's the other way around isn't it? The Counter sysfs memory
should stay alive for the lifetime of the device. Once the device is
deleted, there's nothing left to access those struct attributes, so that
memory can now be freed. Correct me if my reasoning is wrong here.

Agreed, I'll make this change.

Okay, I'll add some documentation for this structure.

I wasn't too set on calling this "owner" either, but I'm not sure if
"component" would make sense either because I wouldn't label a device
attribute as belonging to any particular component (in fact it's quite
the opposite).

Perhaps the word "scope" would be better. What do you think? Or would
that be too vague as well.

Sure, it'll probably be best to not delay cleanup so I'll try to unwind
here instead of delaying it until the end.

This represents the signal values "high" or "low". With the introduction
of this patchset, these values are no longer strings internally so I
gave them their own data type here.

COUNTER_DATA_TYPE_ENUM is intended for driver-specific Counter enums.
This allows driver authors to define their own Counter enums so that we
don't pollute the Generic Counter interface with enums that are unique
to individual drivers.

I assume you're referring to COUNTER_DATA_TYPE_COUNT_FUNCTION being
separate from these two. That's because a "count function" is actually
part of the Generic Counter paradigm: it's the trigger operation for the
Synapse.

In retrospect, I should have named it "trigger operation" or something
similar when I developed the paradigm originally, but hindsight is
20/20 (I'd probably rename "Synapse" to something else too if I could).
It's unfortunately too late to rename this because we've exposed it to
userspace already as a named sysfs attribute.

Perhaps I can rename this enum constant however to
COUNTER_DATA_TYPE_FUNCTION, or similar, to differentiate it from the
Count extensions.

This structure is used by more than just the Counter extensions, so
maybe a different name than counter_ext_data. Regardless, I see what you
mean by counter_data being too general, so I'll see if I can come up
with another name.

Defining static ops structures in the drivers seemed to have no
advantage when those callbacks are always used via the counter_device
structure. I decided it'd be simpler to just set them directly in the
counter_device structure then.

I could reorganize them into an ops structure again if there's enough
interest.

All right, I can rename these.
