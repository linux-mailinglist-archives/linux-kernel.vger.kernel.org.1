As discussed during Linux Plumbers, here is a small repo with test =

scripts and applications that I've used to look at core scheduling =

unfairness:

   https://github.com/agraf/schedgaps

Please let me know if it's unclear how to use it or if you see issues in =

your environment.

Please also make sure to only run this on idle server class hardware. =

Notebooks will most definitely have too many uncontrollable sources of =

timing entropy to give sensible results.
