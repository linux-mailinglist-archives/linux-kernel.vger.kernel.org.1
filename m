It's not so much that we really _want_ to do this in an external module.
But we aren't adding more trace events and my (limited) knowledge of
BPF let me to the conclusion that its raw tracepoint functionality
requires full events.  I didn't see any other way to do it.

We could put sched_tp in the tree under a debug CONFIG :)

Our Perf team is now actively using this in downstream, using sched_tp, and
finding it very useful.

But I have no problem if this is all simpler in the kernel tree.

Sounds good, thanks!
