Thanks.

I very nearly didn't press "Send" yesterday because I was worried I was
rushing it too much (in order to avoid forgetting it ;-) ). Should have
listened to myself!

I didn't follow all the possible paths. Utlimately the
(un)register_callbacks() functions use a flag variable without a lock
and that can interact in lots of different ways.

To be honest none are especially likely because the normal case is to
register once during boot and never unregister. However we can trigger
register/unregister from userspace so I think they can happen
in parallel.

Double unregister can lead to some especially nasty schedules...
although they still remain pretty unlikely since we need the double
unregister to coincide with a breakpoint:


kgdb_unregister_callbacks()	kgdb_unregister_callbacks()
  .				.	
  test flag			.
  set flag to 0			.
  .				test flag
  .				spin_lock()
*** kgdb trap ***		  .
  . paranoid dbg_io_ops check     .
  .				dbg_io_ops = NULL
  . stop other CPUs
  . try to use NULL dbg_io_ops


I have drawn the kgdb trap in the first column because otherwise things
get too wide but the trap could trigger on any CPU in the system and
provoke the problem.

To be honest I was simply working on "it is racy" and "there's not a
good reason to allow that", especially as we start to develop tools to
bring races to the surfaces someone will yell at us about it sooner or
later ;-).

Of course, implementing it correctly would have been better...
