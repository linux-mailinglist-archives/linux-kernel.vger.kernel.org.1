The kdocs shouldn't speculate on why EEXTEND might fail.  E.g. in some (and
possibility most) environments, the most common scenario of EEXTEND failure
will be EPC invalidation due to virtual machine migration.

This is why I'd prefer that the kernel kill the enclave if and only if the
error is guaranteed to be fatal, e.g. the docs can have a blanket statement
along the lines of:

  An enclave will be killed and its EPC resources will be freed if an error that
  is guaranteed to be fatal is encountered at any time, e.g. if EEXTEND fails as
  EEXTEND can only fail due to loss of EPC, a kernel bug, or silicon bug, all of
  which are unrecoverable.

If only EEXTEND will be treated as fatal, then I see no need to worry about
the return code for EADD.  In that case, simply kill the enclave on EEXTEND
failure instead of on a specific return code.
