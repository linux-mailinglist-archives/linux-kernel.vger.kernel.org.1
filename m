I suppose one option would be to split out the patch that adds the
attribute into it's own patch, and merge that both thru drm and iommu?

If Will/Robin dislike that approach, I'll pick up the parts of the drm
patches which don't depend on the new attribute for v5.11 and the rest
for v5.12.. or possibly a second late v5.11 pull req if airlied
doesn't hate me too much for it.

Going forward, I think we will have one or two more co-dependent
series, like the smmu iova fault handler improvements that Jordan
posted.  So I would like to hear how Will and Robin prefer to handle
those.
