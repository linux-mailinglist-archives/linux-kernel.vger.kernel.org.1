So many ordering riddles I had to put on paper. But I'm getting close to
something RFC-postable now.

No it's more about context tracking. Initially it used TIF_NOHZ to enter
the syscall slow path and call to context tracking on kernel entry and exit.

The problem is that it forces all CPUs, including housekeepers, to run into
that syscall slowpath. So we rather want the context tracking call conditional
on a per cpu basis and not on a per task basis. And static keys are good for
that. That's what x86 does.

So RCU can't help much I fear (but hey, first time I can say that! ;-)

Thanks.
