Keeping "master" in a "master/slave" pairing (i.e. replacing only
"slave") seems incomplete to me. If "master" is paired with "slave", it
should be replaced too. Potential examples: 'primary', 'leader', 'principle',
'controller', 'sender', 'initial'.

Similarly, for "whitelist/blacklist", "whitelist" needs to replaced when
"blacklist" has been. For example, seccomp documentation[1] uses
"allow-list" and "deny-list".

Let's add:

 Where possible, old instances of this language should be replaced when
 it is not tied to external specifications nor userspace ABI/API.

... usage of 'master/slave', 'slave', 'whitelist/blacklist', and
'blacklist' in the Linux kernel.

Let's add:

 Beyond just Linux
 =================

 For those of us in the kernel community involved in specification
 development or similar larger ecosystem conversations, please help
 steer those discussions to avoid these terms in new specifications
 or APIs.
