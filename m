From what I understand (never looked at the code), is that this binary blob
is the same for Windows and Apple. It's basically its own operating system
that does all the work and vmmon is the way to switch to and from it. When
this blob gets an interrupt that it doesn't know about, it assumes it
belongs to the operating system its sharing the machine with and exits back
to it, whether that's Linux, Windows or OSX.

It's not too unlike what jailhouse does with its hypervisor, to take over
the machine and place the running Linux into its own "cell", except that it
will switch full control of the machine back to Linux.
