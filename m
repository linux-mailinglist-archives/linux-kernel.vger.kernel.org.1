Apologies for the delay. I have tried to give this some more thinking,

So, the host driver should through this callback, be able to terminate
any ongoing requests/commands - and also try to make sure that the
(e)MMC/SD card remains in the data transfer state. Moreover, no locks
and no IRQs must be used to manage this, right?

Have you really tried if this works for real?

> +       mmc_start_request(host, mrq);

This looks like the wrong approach to me, as it will try to re-use the
regular request based path, where the host driver is allowed to use
locks, IRQs, DMAs, etc, etc.

I would suggest inventing a new separate request path and a new host
ops, to deal with these kinds of requests.

In this way, the below part with host->ops->req_completion_poll, can
probably be removed. Instead we may just wait for the request to
return from the new request path.

It looks like the above I/O read/write interface for pstore is
intended to be used when the platform is up and running and not during
a panic, correct?

If so, I don't get why it can't use the regular block interface, as
any other file system does, for example?

So, this will use several locks, which may be a problem, right?

Moreover, if there is an ongoing I/O request (or any other active
command/request for that matter), then the host is already claimed by
the mmc core. Normally, we would then wait for that request to be
completed, to trigger the release of the host and then allow us to
claim it here.

However, because of the kernel panic, I assume it's quite likely that
any ongoing request will not be completed at all, as IRQs may not
work, for example.

In other words, we may be hanging here forever waiting to claim the
host. Unless we are lucky, because of no ongoing request, although we
would still have to succeed walking through all the locking, etc, in
mmc_claim_host().

Do note, as part of the mmc_claim_host() we may also runtime resume
the host, if it was runtime suspended (which is quite likely). To
runtime resume a host via runtime PM, we may end up ungating device
clocks, power on corresponding PM domains, run a so called re-tuning
sequence to restore communication with the card, etc, etc. The point
is, all these things must also be possible to do, without locks and by
using a polling based "mode"...

> +       mmc_wait_for_pstore_req(host, mrq);

Okay, so let's assume that we are lucky and succeed to claim and
runtime resume the host above.

Then we also need to runtime resume the card, as it may be runtime
suspended. In the "worst case", runtime resuming the card means a
complete re-initialization of it, covering a series of commands and
turning on regulators, for example.

Having said the above, I am not entirely convinced that it makes sense
to support this, at all.

Not only, will the support be highly fragile from the mmc core point
of view, but there is also a significant complexity for an mmc host
driver to support this (at least in general).

Kind regards
Uffe
