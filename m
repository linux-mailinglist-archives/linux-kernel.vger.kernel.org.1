So thanks for addressing these.  That said, I do wonder if this is quite
the right thing to do.  I'm assuming that the old sites still exist in the
wayback machine somewhere, and somebody might actually want to find them.
Pity the poor anthropologist researching the origins of the the
billion-line, free-software kernels widely used in the 2500's...

So maybe we should either mark it as "[BROKEN]" or make a direct link into
the wayback machine instead?  That would enable the suitably motivated to
go after the content that once existed.

Thoughts anybody?

Thanks,

jon
