NACK.

For starters, if this were an actual fix, it should have a Fixes header.

Don't do random changes in a single patch and call it a "fix". I don't 
see what changing the cell size has to do with smp, nor adding L2 cache. 
The latter could be a patch of its own, after fixes are applied (to 
avoid conflicts when backporting that fix to older branches). A cell 
size of two used to be perfectly valid, please checking the DT binding.

Finally, you're changing generic S700 code here - you can't just break 
Cubieboard7 just because your Labrador has too old BL31 firmware. Can't 
you just update its TF-A firmware and use the standard PSCI interface 
for Linux? If not, then you should add your workaround to your 
module's/board's .dts(i) instead of the SoC's .dtsi.

Thanks,
Andreas
