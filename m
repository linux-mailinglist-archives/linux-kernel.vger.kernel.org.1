Can you clarify what the actual flow of control is?  If I had to guess, it'=
s:

GRUB (or other bootloader) writes log.

GRUB transfers control to the ACM.  At this point, GRUB is done
running and GRUB code will not run again.

ACM validates system configuration and updates TPM state using magic
privileged TPM access.

ACM transfers control to the shiny new Linux secure launch entry point

Maybe this is right, and maybe this is wrong.  But I have some
questions about this whole setup.  Is the ACM code going to inspect
this log at all?  If so, why?  Who supplies the ACM code?  If the ACM
can be attacked by putting its inputs (e.g. this log) in the wrong
place in memory, why should this be considered anything other than a
bug in the ACM?

If GRUB is indeed done by the time anyone consumes the log, why does
GRUB care where the log ends up?

And finally, the log presumably has nonzero size, and it would be nice
not to pin some physical memory forever for the log.  Could the kernel
copy it into tmpfs during boot so it's at least swappable and then
allow userspace to delete it when userspace is done with it?
