I guess that you talk about this thread
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CA+55aFwUfA__6MgMgjENnx+_RYY2ZOOLiSx2ea1AvYhSZN+78A@mail.gmail.com/

This approach has several drawbacks:

  + Too long prefix might make it hard to see the real messages
    because of shrunken/wrapped lines.

  + Too long lines are problem with slow consoles.

  + More space will be necessary to store all the time stamps.

  + Userspace tools would need/want to parse the format. We would
    need to maintain it forever.


Linus had an interesting idea to print all timestamps regularly.
The frequency might be configurable. It might print, for example,
the following line every 10 minutes or once a day:

  [48551.015086] System alive: b[xxxx.xxxx] m[xxxx.xxxx]

It might be useful in general to see when the system was still alive
before it froze.

Would it be enough to sort messages printed with different clock
sources?
