Maybe just remove the "Decoding the user instruction ... bad architecture
precedent" sentence? The sentence is vague.

As described in the following "It may not function ..." sentence, the real
issue of parsing the instruction is the instruction may be modified by
another processor before it's parsed in the #GP handler.

If just keep the "It may not function ..." sentence, is that good enough to
explain why we don't parse the faulting instruction?

Internally we did discuss the error code in #GP for PASID with HW architects.
But due to some uarch reason, it's not simple to report the error code for
PASID:( Please see previous discussion on the error code for PASID:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200427224646.GA103955@otc-nc-03/

It's painful for our SW guys to check exception reasons if hardware
doesn't explicitly tell us.

Hopefully the heuristics (fixup the PASID MSR if the process already has
a valid PASID but the MSR doesn't have one yet) in this patch is acceptable.

OK. I will fix this issue.

Thank you very much for your review!
