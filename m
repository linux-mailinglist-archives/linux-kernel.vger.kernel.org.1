I suspect that he would like to keep the tracing.

It might be worth trying the branches, given that they would be constant
and indexed by "i".  The compiler might well remove the indirection.

The compiler guys brag about doing so, which of course might or might
not have any correlation to a given compiler actually doing so.  :-/

Having a vfree_bulk() might well be useful, but I would feel more
confidence in that if there were other callers of kfree_bulk().

But again, either way, future work as far as this series is concerned.
