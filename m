Hi Michael! This is more likely due to historical reasons:
the initial version of prctl(PR_SET_MM, ...) been operating
with individual fields and this was very unsafe. Because of
this we left it under CAP_SYS_RESOURCE (because you must have
enough rights to change such deep fields). Later we switched
to PR_SET_MM_MAP which is a safe version and allows to modify
memory map as a "whole" so we can do a precise check. And this
allowed us to relax requirements.

As to me the old PR_SET_MM should be deprecated and finally
removed from the kernel, but since it is a part of API we
can't do such thing easily.

Same time current PR_SET_MM internally is rather an alias
for PR_SET_MM_MAP because we create a temporary map and
pass it to the verification procedure so it looks like
we can relax requirements here to match the PR_SET_MM_MAP
call. But need to think maybe I miss something obvious here.
