Ah makes sense, thanks!

This change hasn't had any bake time in linux-next. I didn't deem it
sufficiently risky or complex to warrant such integration testing.

That said I'm a little fuzzy on where to draw the line for which kinds
of changes really should be required to have bake time in -next. If
you think this is one of those cases, we can hold off on this until we
have some bake time for v5.9.

Either way this is a good reminder for the v5.9 merge window when we
plan to have more featureful changes going in for SafeSetID (although
those will be completely internal to the LSM, so low chance of
breaking anything outside the module).
