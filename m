We need both sleeps to make this work reliably so basically
reverting your 'drm/panel: st7703: Make the sleep exit timing match the
spec' makes things stable again.

We don't need to sleep 120ms after sleep out though since our panel only
requires 15ms as per data sheet there so it really makes sense to make
these configurable.
