I agree.

I anticipate that most of the nasty fine-grained stuff will end up in
userspace down the road.  Systems can be configured such that
provisioning is done as root, or systems can end up with fancy SELinux
rules or daemons that pass around fds or whatever, but all of this can
be done with the kernel code in this patchset.
