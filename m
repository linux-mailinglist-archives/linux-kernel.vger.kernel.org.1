Apologies I missed that.

A big #ifdef. But this kind of use I don't think was anticipated. And generally
if we want to allow that, it has to be done via a proper API. Drivers picking
random uclamp values is as bad as them picking random RT priority.

Yes this is the problem of RT for a general purpose systems. It's hard to
reason about their priorities/importance since it's not a special purpose
system with well defined spec of what hardware/software will be running on it
and their precise requirements is not known before hand.

If you propose something that will help the discussion. I think based on the
same approach Peter has taken to prevent random RT priorities. In uclamp case
I think we just want to allow driver to opt RT tasks out of the default
boosting behavior.

I'm a bit wary that this extra layer of tuning might create a confusion, but
I can't reason about why is it bad for a driver to say I don't want my RT task
to be boosted too.
