Yeah, so modifier support in -modesetting is totally broken. It should
be disabled by default because the stuff just doesn't really work.

If that doesn't help then I guess we need to do the same thing as what
we've done for atomic already in:

commit 26b1d3b527e7bf3e24b814d617866ac5199ce68d
Author: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>
Date:   Thu Sep 5 20:53:18 2019 +0200

    drm/atomic: Take the atomic toys away from X

For added insult for the atomic stuff: Xorg master branch is actually
fixed, but no one has done a release of that in over 2 years, so the
fixes never got anywhere. I have little hope the Xorg will get back
into shape, seems abandoned unfortunately.
