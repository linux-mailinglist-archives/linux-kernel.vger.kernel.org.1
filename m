I think that this is a difficult ask; "prove that god doesn't exist".

Andi's point is that there is no known user it breaks, and the Intel
folks did some digging into potential users who might be affected by
this, including 'rr' brought up by Andy, and concluded that there won't
be breakage as a result of this patchset:

	https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rr-dev/2018-March/000616.html

Sure, if you poke at it you could see a behavior change, but is there
an actual user that will be affected by it? I suspect not.

If there's no known user that will be broken here, can we consider
merging this to be disabled by default and let distros try it out? This
will let us find these users while providing an easy way to work around
the problem.
