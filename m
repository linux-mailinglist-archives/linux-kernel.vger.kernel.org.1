Yes, it appears that use_hierarchy=0 which is probably because the test
mounts cgroup v1, creates a child group within that and does not set
use_hierarchy on the root. On v2 root always has use_hierarchy enabled.

I'm don't know if that could happen without reparenting. I suppose if
use_hierarchy=1 then actually this patch will result in root being
overcharged, so perhaps it should also check for use_hierarchy?
