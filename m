Yeah, that can't possibly work.  The USB core expects that any host 
controller device (or at least, any PCI host controller device) has its 
driver_data set to point to a struct usb_hcd.  It doesn't expect a host 
controller to be bound to anything other than a host controller driver.

Things could easily go very wrong here.  For example, suppose at this 
point the ehci-hcd driver just happens to bind to the EHCI controller.  
When this happens, the EHCI controller hardware takes over all the USB 
connections that were routed to the UHCI controller.  How will vfio-pci 
deal with that?  Pretty ungracefully, I imagine.

The only way to make this work at all is to unbind both uhci-hcd and 
ehci-hcd first.  Then after both are finished you can safely bind 
vfio-pci to the EHCI controller and the UHCI controllers (in that 
order).
