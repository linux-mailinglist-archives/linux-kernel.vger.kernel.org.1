I don't think this is the right fix. Lemme quote Tony from a previous
email:

"The answer isn't to tinker with "struct mce". Other changes could
trigger this same change in alignment. Anything that is this perfomance
sensitive needs to have some "__attribute__((aligned(64)))" (or
whatever) to make sure arbitrary changes elsewhere don't do this."

And yes, your diff is not tinkering with struct mce but it is tinkering
with percpu vars which are of type struct mce.

However, the proper fix is...

... yes, exactly, you need to identify the contention where this
happens, causing a cacheline to bounce or a variable straddles across a
cacheline boundary, causing the read to fetch two cachelines and thus
causes that slowdown. And then align that var to the beginning of a
cacheline.

Also, maybe I missed this but, do you trigger this only on Xeon Phi or
on "normal" x86 too?

Because if it is Xeon Phi only, then that might explain the size of the
slowdown and that it happens only there because it is a, well, "strange"
machine. :-)

Thx.
