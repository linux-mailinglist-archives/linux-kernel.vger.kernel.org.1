> parents. The firmware also implements thermal throttling, so even some
> thermal pressure can change those parameters behind Linux back.
>=20
> DVFS is currently implemented on the arm, core, h264, v3d, isp and hevc
> clocks, so updating any of them using the MMIO driver (and thus behind the
> firmware's back) can lead to troubles, the arm clock obviously being the
> most problematic.
>=20
> In order to make Linux play as nice as possible with those constraints, it
> makes sense to rely on the firmware clocks as much as possible. However,
> the firmware doesn't seem to provide some equivalents to their MMIO
> counterparts, so we can't really replace that driver entirely.
>=20
> Fortunately, the firmware has an interface to discover the clocks it
> exposes.
>=20
> Let's use it to discover, register the clocks in the clocks framework and
> then expose them through the device tree for consumers to use them.
