Hmm, the patch requires at least pageblock_nr_pages, which is 2MB on x86 (dunno
about ARM), so 16KiB would be way too small. What are the actual granularities then?

The problem is, without some control of page migration and reclaim, the simple
preference approach will not work after some uptime, as David suggested. It will
just mean that the preferred rank will be allocated first, then the
non-preferred rank (Linux will fill all unused memory with page cache if
possible), then reclaim will free memory from both ranks without any special
care, and new allocations will thus come from both ranks.
