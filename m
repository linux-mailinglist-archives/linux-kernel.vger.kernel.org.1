Yeah, as I mentioned in the tracker, there's indeed a performance impact
with this fix.  That's what made me add the RFC in the subject ;-)

Ok, thanks for the suggestion.  That may actually work, although it will
make the rename more expensive of course.  I'll test that tomorrow and
eventually follow-up with a patch.
