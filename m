So I read through this a bit, and while I haven't gone through every line of
code I'm somewhat inclined toward taking it.

During the original RISC-V port submission we went back and forth between
having this first-level interrupt controller in arch/riscv/ vs
drivers/irqchip/.  The original deciding factor was that the ISA mandated the
interrupt controller, but as that's proving to be less and less the case every
day (with the CLIC and M-mode Linux) it certainly seem sane to move all our
interrupt controller drivers out of arch/riscv/.

This is certainly a step in the right direction, and it handles some of the
more glaring issues (iscv_timer_interrupt and lacking IRQs for the CLINT).  I
think we should just go ahead and merge it, even though there might be some
more refactoring to do when we eventually end up with another interrupt
controller.

I think it's best if this all goes in through a single tree, as it seems more
work than it's worth to split it up.  I'm happy to take it through my tree if
that's OK with the irqchip folks?
