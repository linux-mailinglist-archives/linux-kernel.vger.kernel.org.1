Will do.

Agree. I think I over-focusses on the entry path. I will review the
exit path more closely.

Assuming the kgdb function is used exclusively from the trap handler
then this is correct.

You'd still get odd effects with library functions that are used inside
and outside the debugger (which can be breakpointed but don't trigger
inside kgdb). Arguably the effect is clearer to users if they can see
kdb/kgdb functions behaving the same way as library functions. It's odd
but it won't promote false expectations from users.
