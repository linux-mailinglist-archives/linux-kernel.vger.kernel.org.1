Subject: [15 Jun 2020 Mon] Orchard Road Walking Exercises: 5140 steps or 
3.92 km in one hour

On 15 June 2020 Monday, I, Mr. Turritopsis Dohrnii Teo En Ming, have 
walked 5140 steps or 3.92 km from Orchard Road MRT Station (Singapore) 
to The Cathay shopping center (Singapore) and from The Cathay shopping 
center back to Orchard Road MRT Station in one hour (55 minutes to be 
exact).

My fasting blood glucose readings after the walking exercise are 6.1 
mmol/L and 6.1 mmol/L (take 2 readings to confirm).

My blood pressure readings after the walking exercise are 114/83 and 
110/85 (take 2 readings to confirm).

I have been doing consistent walking exercises for a few years until 
suspension on 13 April 2020. I resumed/restarted walking exercises on 2 
June 2020.

I would like to continue doing walking exercises every day for at least 
45 mins to one hour or more until I am 14 BILLION years old. I need to 
have determination and perseverance in doing walking exercises every day 
to keep fit and healthy until I am 14 BILLION years old. I want to live 
until 14 BILLION years old.

I cannot run or jog because of early onset of osteoarthritis (wear and 
tear) of both knees at 40 years old. As of 15 June 2020, I am 42 years 
old. I have the capability to walk up to 17 km in one day.
