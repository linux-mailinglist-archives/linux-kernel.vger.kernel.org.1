I would not recommend taking the original RISC-V linux fork as reference.

Rather we should study how things are done on other architectures.

I really appreciate the attempt to make RISC-V PMU driver depend on DT
but if we are going this route then we should maximize the use of Linux
platform driver framework. In fact, whenever possible we should integrate
RISC-V features as platform drivers under the drivers/ directory.

I thought about SBI PMU counters as well. In future, we can easily
expose SBI PMU counters as RAW events in the same RISC-V PMU
driver. The sbi_probe_extension() can be used in RISC-V PMU driver
to check for SBI PMU counters so no special provisions needed in DT
for SBI PMU counters.

Also, the RISC-V PMU driver can be implemented such that it will
work for RV32, RV64, NoMMU RV32, and NoMMU RV64.
