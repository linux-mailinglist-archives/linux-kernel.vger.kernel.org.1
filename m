The default is what it is: default choice which suits most of the nodes.

If the node is not complete in it's present form then it is not in it's
default state. imho.

This series opens up the possibility of nodes leaking to dtb with known
broken state and the driver should have a better strategy than 'works by
luck' to handle it ;)

Imho 'disabled' is the default for nodes like McASP as it is:
"Indicates that the device is not presently operational, but it might
become operational in the future" (for example, needed properties added
to the node).
