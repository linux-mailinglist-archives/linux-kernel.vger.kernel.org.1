Hi,

This is the friendly semi-automated patch-bot of Greg Kroah-Hartman.
You have sent him a patch that has triggered this response.

Right now, the development tree you have sent a patch for is "closed"
due to the timing of the merge window.  Don't worry, the patch(es) you
have sent are not lost, and will be looked at after the merge window is
over (after the -rc1 kernel is released by Linus).

So thank you for your patience and your patches will be reviewed at this
later time, you do not have to do anything further, this is just a short
note to let you know the patch status and so you don't worry they didn't
make it through.

thanks,

greg k-h's patch email bot
