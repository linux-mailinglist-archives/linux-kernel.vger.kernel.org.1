It would be nice if you could wait until that is picked.

This check for mhi_cntrl->ee == MHI_EE_FP will not work with my upcoming 
fixes.

I feel this should be in mhi_fw_load_handler() in function in boot.c 
before we return
success and exit the function.
-if (mhi_cntrl->ee == MHI_EE_EDL)
+if (mhi_cntrl->ee == MHI_EE_EDL) {
+        mhi_queue_state_transition(mhi_cntrl, DEV_ST_TRANSITION_READY);
          return;
+}
I can submit a patch for this as well so you can wait and have it picked 
before
your current patch. There is no need to include the check for ee as 
MHI_EE_FP, as it
should be implied.

So, basically the next power up with EDL will push EDL image, then wait 
for READY and
after an M0 is done to the device, it will trigger the EE change to FP 
on ctrl event
ring.
