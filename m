If it helps you could delay printks on shutdown (via
/proc/sys/kernel/printk_delay) and record a video clip. I could make
storage available for an upload.

This disables the ahci controller which means disk/cdrom requests won't

I have no idea where this flush_workqueue() is coming from. The command
  scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh vmlinux $(pwd)/ kernel_power_off+0x3d/0x70

should reveal that.
The cdrom is polled by the kernel every two seconds. I *think* the
kernel is blocked for some reason and then the cdrom polled. This can't
complete and you see the srX warning. The window is quite small but not
impossible. 
I managed to fabricate this case but after

The system shutdowns. So you are facing something different. I am
surprised that the workqueue stall detector did not yell here. The patch
at the bottom should get rid of the sr warnings.

I assumed the wifi driver shuts the AHCI port for some reason. But
according to this log it does not happen, the ahci port is shutdown
properly. The patch at the bottom should get rid of the sr warning. Then
could you please try the other patch so we see which workqueue is
blocked? I am curious to see why the system is blocked.
