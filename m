Sorry, the discussion lasts more than 2 weeks, so I'm trying to collect
the comments here.

We are trying to confirm if the new added bus name "dfl" should be
OK, instead of "fpga-dfl"? Cause dfl could be an enumeration method
independent of the fpga subsystem, although the FPGA is currently the
only user.


The first mail is
	[GIT PULL] FPGA Manager additional changes for 5.10
	https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fpga/20200921000855.GA15612@epycbox.lan/T/#u

In this mail you have some comments for this patch:

	0002-fpga-dfl-move-dfl_device_id-to-mod_devicetable.h.patch
	https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fpga/20200915035909.GA2217@epycbox.lan/T/#u

	[Greg's comments]
	- dfl_device_id is not descriptive, it means nothing to anyone outside
	  of the fpga subsystem.
	- fpga_dfl_device_id perhaps instead?  That gives people a chance to know
	  where to look for this

	[More Greg's comments]
	You are now "playing in the namespace of the whole kernel", so yes, you
	need to be as descriptive as possible so that everyone knows what is
	happening as all subsystems touch these files.

	No one knows what "dfl_" means.  Heck, I have no idea, I keep thinking
	"Device Firmware Loader" or something like that.

	So making it obvious, and unique, and "short enough" is the requirement.

	Naming is hard :)


And then we are trying to explain "dfl" could be an enumeration method
independent of the fpga subsystem, so we want to keep the naming "dfl".

	[Hao's comments]
	Actually Device Feature List is introduced in FPGA, but it doesn't limit
	the usage in FPGA only. It's just a method to discover features from a
	device in case we don't have Device Tree, for sure it can be extended and used
	in other devices too. So it can be bigger namespace than FPGA. This is the
	reason we picked dfl_fpga (DFL based FPGA) before (suggested by Alan),
	for sure it's possible to have "DFL based XXX" in the future, even
	currently only FPGA uses DFL. This is the reason I think bus type "dfl" sounds ok
	in bus code submission review, DFL based FPGA has its own dfl_fpga specific
	ioctl definition, but bus for driver matching can be reused, so it seems
	we fine, if we need to support other devices reusing DFL.

	[Moritz's comments] in this mail thread:
	Let's leave it as is -- An FPGA is one possible implementation and as for
	other buses, you wouldn't call it fpga-usb or usb-fpga
	just because the USB bus is implemented in an FPGA if it behaves like a
	normal USB bus.
	Having an ASIC based DFL bus show up under dfl-fpga /
	fpga-dfl in sysfs would be super confusing.
										
	I mostly think we should keep DFL generic where it touches userspace and
	defines ABI, since we cannot change it afterwards.

	I rest my point with the bus being independent of FPGAs despite
	the FPGA being the (currently) only user.

	I just think it doesn't make a lot of sense to call it
	fpga-dfl or dfl-fpga. But if everyone else disagrees ... naming is hard :-)


Also the main code for dfl bus (we name it "dfl" in this patch) is already merged to
linux-next, see this patch:

	fpga: dfl: create a dfl bus type to support DFL devices
	https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fpga/20200905003231.GB3157@epycbox.lan/T/#u	

So we also want to keep the naming of bus stuff aligned with the name of user
ABIs, to keep the driver self-consistent.


Hope I make things clear.

Thanks,
Yilun
