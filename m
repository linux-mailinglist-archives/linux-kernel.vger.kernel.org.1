I requested the following when acking these changes:

"""
Note to the maintainer: to the extent possible, please put the patches
in this series that touch drivers/firmware/efi on a separate branch
based on v5.9-rc1, and merge that into your for-v5.10 branch at the
appropriate spot. I don't have anything queued in the EFI tree at the
moment, and so these changes can happily go through the riscv tree, as
long as I am not forced to merge a bunch of unrelated changes on the
off chance that something does come up.
"""

Something has come up, and given that the patch

efi: Rename arm-init to efi-init common for all arch

lives on your for-next branch after a bunch of RISCV changes, I cannot
merge anything for EFI without pulling all of that into the EFI tree
as well.

Also, it is not clear to me whether the current ordering does not
break bisect, given that efi-init.o is referenced in patch #8 but is
not created until patch #9

So could you please do the following:

- drop 'efi: Rename arm-init to efi-init common for all arch' from the
top of your for-next branch
- create a separate topic branch that carries the dropped patch
- recreate the for-next branch so the topic branch is merged into it
at the right spot (i.e., before patch #8)

That way, I can merge your topic branch into the EFI tree as well, and
apply the other EFI changes on top of it.

Thanks,
Ard.
