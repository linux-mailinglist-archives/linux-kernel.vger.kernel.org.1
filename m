From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

preempt_disable() and local_irq_disable/save() are in principle per CPU big
kernel locks. This has several downsides:

  - The protection scope is unknown

  - Violation of protection rules is hard to detect by instrumentation

  - For PREEMPT_RT such sections, unless in low level critical code, can
    violate the preemptability constraints.

To address this PREEMPT_RT introduced the concept of local_locks which are
strictly per CPU.

The lock operations map to preempt_disable(), local_irq_disable/save() and
the enabling counterparts on non RT enabled kernels.

If lockdep is enabled local locks gain a lock map which tracks the usage
context. This will catch cases where an area is protected by
preempt_disable() but the access also happens from interrupt context. local
locks have identified quite a few such issues over the years, the most
recent example is:

  b7d5dc21072cd ("random: add a spinlock_t to struct batched_entropy")

Aside of the lockdep coverage this also improves code readability as it
precisely annotates the protection scope.

PREEMPT_RT substitutes these local locks with 'sleeping' spinlocks to
protect such sections while maintaining preemtability and CPU locality.

local locks can replace:

  - preempt_enable()/disable() pairs
  - local_irq_disable/enable() pairs
  - local_irq_save/restore() pairs

They are also used to replace code which implicitly disables preemption
like:

  - get_cpu()/put_cpu()
  - get_cpu_var()/put_cpu_var()

with PREEMPT_RT friendly constructs.

+local_lock and PREEMPT_RT

+local_lock should be used in situations where disabling preemption or

+PREEMPT_RT kernel due to the PREEMPT_RT specific spinlock_t semantics.

+local_lock on RT
+----------------
+
+The mapping of local_lock to spinlock_t on PREEMPT_RT kernels has a few
+implications. For example, on a non-PREEMPT_RT kernel the following code
+sequence works as expected::
+
+  local_lock_irq(&local_lock);
+  raw_spin_lock(&lock);
+
+and is fully equivalent to::
+
+   raw_spin_lock_irq(&lock);
+
+On a PREEMPT_RT kernel this code sequence breaks because local_lock_irq()
+is mapped to a per-CPU spinlock_t which neither disables interrupts nor
+preemption. The following code sequence works perfectly correct on both
+PREEMPT_RT and non-PREEMPT_RT kernels::
+
+  local_lock_irq(&local_lock);
+  spin_lock(&lock);
+
+Another caveat with local locks is that each local_lock has a specific
+protection scope. So the following substitution is wrong::
+
+  func1()
+  {
+    local_irq_save(flags);    -> local_lock_irqsave(&local_lock_1, flags);
+    func3();
+    local_irq_restore(flags); -> local_lock_irqrestore(&local_lock_1, flag=
s);
+  }
+
+  func2()
+  {
+    local_irq_save(flags);    -> local_lock_irqsave(&local_lock_2, flags);
+    func3();
+    local_irq_restore(flags); -> local_lock_irqrestore(&local_lock_2, flag=
s);
+  }
+
+  func3()
+  {
+    lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled();
+    access_protected_data();
+  }
+
+On a non-PREEMPT_RT kernel this works correctly, but on a PREEMPT_RT kernel
+local_lock_1 and local_lock_2 are distinct and cannot serialize the callers
+of func3(). Also the lockdep assert will trigger on a PREEMPT_RT kernel
+because local_lock_irqsave() does not disable interrupts due to the
+PREEMPT_RT-specific semantics of spinlock_t. The correct substitution is::
+
+  func1()
+  {
+    local_irq_save(flags);    -> local_lock_irqsave(&local_lock, flags);
+    func3();
+    local_irq_restore(flags); -> local_lock_irqrestore(&local_lock, flags);
+  }
+
+  func2()
+  {
+    local_irq_save(flags);    -> local_lock_irqsave(&local_lock, flags);
+    func3();
+    local_irq_restore(flags); -> local_lock_irqrestore(&local_lock, flags);

+  struct foo *p =3D get_cpu_ptr(&var1);

+  spin_lock(&p->lock);
+  p->count +=3D this_cpu_read(var2);
+
+This is correct code on a non-PREEMPT_RT kernel, but on a PREEMPT_RT kernel
+this breaks. The PREEMPT_RT-specific change of spinlock_t semantics does
+not allow to acquire p->lock because get_cpu_ptr() implicitly disables
+preemption. The following substitution works on both kernels::
+
+  struct foo *p;
+
+  migrate_disable();
+  p =3D this_cpu_ptr(&var1);
+  spin_lock(&p->lock);
+  p->count +=3D this_cpu_read(var2);
+
+On a non-PREEMPT_RT kernel migrate_disable() maps to preempt_disable()
+which makes the above code fully equivalent. On a PREEMPT_RT kernel
+migrate_disable() ensures that the task is pinned on the current CPU which
+in turn guarantees that the per-CPU access to var1 and var2 are staying on
+the same CPU.
+
+The migrate_disable() substitution is not valid for the following
+scenario::
+
+  func()
+  {
+    struct foo *p;
+
+    migrate_disable();
+    p =3D this_cpu_ptr(&var1);
+    p->val =3D func2();
+
+While correct on a non-PREEMPT_RT kernel, this breaks on PREEMPT_RT because
+here migrate_disable() does not protect against reentrancy from a
+preempting task. A correct substitution for this case is::
+
+  func()
+  {
+    struct foo *p;
+
+    local_lock(&foo_lock);
+    p =3D this_cpu_ptr(&var1);
+    p->val =3D func2();
+
+On a non-PREEMPT_RT kernel this protects against reentrancy by disabling
+preemption. On a PREEMPT_RT kernel this is achieved by acquiring the
+underlying per-CPU spinlock.
