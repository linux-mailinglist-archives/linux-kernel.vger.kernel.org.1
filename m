Please don't touch the caller's file descriptor table from read/write
handlers, only from ioctl handlers. A process should always be able to
read from files supplied by an untrusted user without having to worry
about new entries mysteriously popping up in its fd table.

I don't see the issue. Can't you replace "switch (cmd)" with "switch
(cmd & ~IOCSIZE_MASK)" and then check the size separately?
