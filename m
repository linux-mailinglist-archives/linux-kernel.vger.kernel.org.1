Yes, it applies all devices that meet the condition.

Yes indeed I missed that word...

Clearly I didn't express my intention well enough.
What I meant was, we can either remove the "disable ASPM on bridge" case completely, or do what this patch does.

Or missing a part to re-enable ASPM in later time.

I do prefer remote it completely, but I was afraid of introducing any regression so I just made the case more "special".

Seems like Windows doesn't disable ASPM on bridge to bridge case, can we take the risk and remove the special case completely?
