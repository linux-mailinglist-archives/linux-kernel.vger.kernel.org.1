Hi Andreas,

The problem is that the kernel does not emulate/spoof the SLDT =
instruction, only SGDT, SIDT, and SMSW.
SLDT and STR weren't thought to be commonly used, so emulation/spoofing =
wasn=E2=80=99t added.
In the last few months I have seen reports of one or two (32-bit) =
Windows games that use SLDT though.
Can you share more information about the application you=E2=80=99re =
running?

Maybe the best path is to add kernel emulation/spoofing for SLDT and STR =
on 32 and 64-bit, just to cover all the cases. It should be a pretty =
simple patch, I=E2=80=99ll start working on it.

Alternately, I did work on a Wine patch to emulate the UMIP instructions =
in user-space, but it adds a lot of code and I don=E2=80=99t think =
there=E2=80=99s much appetite for it in upstream Wine (especially since =
the kernel emulation is sufficient for almost all cases).
https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2020-February/160027.html

In the meantime, an easy way to disable UMIP without rebuilding the =
kernel is to pass 'clearcpuid=3D514=E2=80=99 on the kernel command line.
