I can see that aspect, but there were pretty clear messages in one of
the other threads:

 "It's not about whether or not host is clean. It's for the cases that
  users just don't want it enabled on host, to not break the
  applications or drivers that do have split lock issue."

 "My thought is for CSPs that they might not turn on SLD on their
  product environment. Any split lock in kernel or drivers may break
  their service for tenants."

which I back then called out as proliferating crap and ensuring that
this stuff never gets fixed.

I still call it out as exactly that and you know as well as I do that
this is the reality.

For people like you who actually want to debug stuff in a guest, the
extra 10 lines of hack on top of the other 1000 lines of hacks you
already have are not really something which justifies to give hardware
and OS/application vendors the easy way out to avoid fixing their broken
crap.

Thanks,
