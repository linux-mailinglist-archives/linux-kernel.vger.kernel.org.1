Greetings

This notification memo has been sent to you three times without a response=
 from you and this will be the last time and I do hope you receive it.
This inquiry is about an account holder, who died and has no successor ove=
r his fund with the bank.
The essence of this communication with you is to request your willingness =
to accept this inheritance left behind by my client if you are legally and=
 legitimately appointed.
You must appreciate that I am constrained from providing you with more det=
ailed information at this point. Upon your response, I will give you more =
detailed information on the deceased client and the process of nominating =
you to inherit his wealth. Send your comments with your full names and you=
r telephone number to enable us discuss .

Yours faithfully,
William Saha.
