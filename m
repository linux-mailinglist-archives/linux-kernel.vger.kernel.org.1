Yeah. I was trying to avoid that, but if we end up needing to
distinguish between the two cases anyway, we might just as well
optimize that too.

I don't follow. I'm not aware of arm64 doing anything out of the
ordinary with .bss? Note that arm64 does not have a separate
decompressor, so the EFI stub is part of the kernel proper. This is
why sections are renamed to start with .init

I don't remember, to be honest, but I'm pretty sure I copy-pasted that
from elsewhere at the time.

The ARM decompressor has this hideous hack, where text [and rodata]
executes straight from flash, and BSS is relocated into DRAM. In order
for this to work, it actually *requires* GOT indirections for BSS
items, to ensure that all BSS references use absolute addresses, which
can be relocated independently from the rest of the kernel image. This
is the reason ARM does not permit a .data section in the decompressor.
However, the EFI stub does not support execute in place from flash,
and so we can permit a .data section there. At the same time, we don't
support GOT indirections in the EFI stub, so we cannot use the BSS
section. So instead, we just put the few BSS pieces we have into .data
instead.
