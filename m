I think things are getting confused here. The problem is that clearing
the page LRU flag is not the same as acquiring the LRU lock.

I was looking through patch 22 and it occured to me that the
documentation in __pagevec_lru_add_fn was never updated. My worry is
that it might have been overlooked, either that or maybe you discussed
it previously and I missed the discussion. There it calls out that you
either have to hold onto the LRU lock, or you have to test PageLRU
after clearing the Mlocked flag otherwise you risk introducing a race.
It seems to me like you could potentially just collapse the lock down
further if you are using it more inline with the 2b case as defined
there rather than trying to still use it to protect the Mlocked flag
even though you have already pulled the LRU bit before taking the
lock. Either that or this is more like the pagevec_lru_move_fn in
which case you are already holding the LRU lock so you just need to
call the test and clear before trying to pull the page off of the LRU
list.

I get that there is a gap between the two in __split_huge_page_tail.
My concern is more the fact that you are pulling the bit testing
outside of the locked region when I don't think it needs to be. The
lock is being taken unconditionally, so why pull the testing out when
you could just do it inside the lock anyway? My worry is that you
might be addressing __split_huge_page_tail but in the process you
might be introducing a new race with something like
__pagevec_lru_add_fn.

If I am not mistaken the Mlocked flag can still be cleared regardless
of if the LRU bit is set or not. So you can still clear the LRU bit
before you pull the page out of the list, but it can be done after
clearing the Mlocked flag instead of before you have even taken the
LRU lock. In that way it would function more similar to how you
handled pagevec_lru_move_fn() as all this function is really doing is
moving the pages out of the unevictable list into one of the other LRU
lists anyway since the Mlocked flag was cleared.

I have the same argument here as above. The LRU lock is being used to
protect the Mlocked flag, as such there isn't a need to move the
get_page and clearing of the LRU flag up.  The get_page() call isn't
needed until just before we delete the page from the LRU list, and the
clearing isn't really needed until after we have already cleared the
Mlocked flag to see if we even have any work that we have to do, but
we do need to clear it before we are allowed to delete the page from
the LRU list.
