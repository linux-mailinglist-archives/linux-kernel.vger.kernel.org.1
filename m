My guess is that people just haven't been spending as much time
optimizing boot performance recently.  I've been trying to do this and
finding that there are quite a few drivers that could benefit from
this flag.

In theory this flag should probably be on by default and it looks like
that was Dmitry's original intention but the state of the world 5
years ago was that it wasn't quite ready for this.  I think, in
particular, drivers that are more core to the system (IOMMUs, clocks,
regulators, etc) may not have been ready, but misc peripherals should
be no problem.

I can do a little bit of profiling next week, but even if we get this
down from 250 ms to 10 ms I'd still like to see async probe turned on.
There's no reason for it to be off and every little bit counts.
