Sure, but *where* are you seeing this?

Is this a problem in mainline, or only in code that you add?

The contract of dump_backtrace() is that it's only called for either:

* the current task
* a task that is blocked in switch_to()

... so I don't think that the current behaviour is wrong as such, though
if it's easy to catch misuse I agree it would be nice to do so for
robustness.

However, we can alwatys race here, so detecting this case is best-effort
and not entirely reliable, and I don't want to leave the impression that
it is. I'm also not a fan of pr_warn() here, since this is indicative of
a kernel bug rather than a user/system issue, and can spam the console
due to a lack of ratelimiting.

So, based on whether this is a problem in existing code, I'd like that
code fix first, and then we can consider adding a WARN_ONCE() or
something ratelimited. Ideally something that'll give us the bactrace or
the code that's calling dump_backtrace() erroneously.

Thanks,
Mark.
