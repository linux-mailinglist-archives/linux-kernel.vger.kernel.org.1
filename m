We really don't want this. :-/

This will make it really difficult to implement the dynamic ftrace, and
this causes more overhead when tracing is not enabled.

Also, ftrace is much more complex, and this will make it difficult to have
function graph tracing and other features.

Gcc has an "instrument-functions" which people asked me why I didn't go
that route, as it lets you do the same (call C code), and its because of
the overhead it adds to each function that I turned it down.
