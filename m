Nouveau for compute has hw page faults. It doesn't have hw page faults
for non-compute fixed function blocks afaik, so there's a hybrid model
going on. But nouveau also doesn't support userspace memory (instead
of driver-allocated buffer objects) for these fixed function blocks,
so no need to have a dma_fence_wait in there.

Yeah I'm working on documentation, and also the notifiers here
hopefully make it clear it's massive pain. I think we could even make
a hard rule that dma_fence in mmu notifier outside of drivers/gpu is a
bug/misfeature.

Might be a good idea to add a MAINTAINERS entry with a K: regex
pattern, so that you can catch such modifiers. We do already have such
a pattern for dma-fence, to catch abuse. So if you want I could type
up a documentation patch for this, get your and others acks and the
dri-devel folks would enforce that the dma_fence_wait madness doesn't
leak beyond drivers/gpu

If you mean drivers/misc/habanalabs, that's going to get taken care of:


commit ed65bfd9fd86dec3772570b0320ca85b9fb69f2e
Author: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>

    habanalabs: don't set default fence_ops->wait

    It's the default.

    Also so much for "we're not going to tell the graphics people how to
    review their code", dma_fence is a pretty core piece of gpu driver
    infrastructure. And it's very much uapi relevant, including piles of
    corresponding userspace protocols and libraries for how to pass these
    around.

    Would be great if habanalabs would not use this (from a quick look
    it's not needed at all), since open source the userspace and playing
    by the usual rules isn't on the table. If that's not possible (because
    it's actually using the uapi part of dma_fence to interact with gpu
    drivers) then we have exactly what everyone promised we'd want to
    avoid.

Oded has agreed to remove the dma-fence usage, since they really don't
need it (and all the baggage that comes with it), plain old completion
is enough for their use. This use is also why I added the regex to
MAINTAINERS, so that in the future we can catch people who try to use
dma_fence because it looks cute and useful, and are completely
oblivious to all the pain and headaches involved.
