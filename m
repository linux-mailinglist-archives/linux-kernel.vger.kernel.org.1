I do run this combination quite frequently, but only as part of
rcutorture, which might not be a representative workload.  For one thing,
it has a minimal userspace consisting only of a trivial init program.
I don't recall having ever seen this.  (I have seen one recent complaint
about an IPI being sent to an offline CPU, but I cannot prove that this
was not due to RCU bugs that I was chasing at the time.)
