That was my understanding of the GKI, thanks for confirming.

Putting apart the non-technical aspect of these changes, the benefit I
see is the memory usage optimization regarding the single kernel image.

With the ARM64 defconfig, multiple platforms and their corresponding
drivers are compiled-in. It results in a big kernel image which fails to
load because of overlapping on DT load address (or something else). When
that is detected, it is fine to adjust the load addresses, otherwise it
is painful to narrow down the root cause.

In order to prevent this, we have to customize the defconfig each
version release.
