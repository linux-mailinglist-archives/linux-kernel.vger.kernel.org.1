Agreed, the additional information from profile-driven optimization
can be just as damaging as that from LTO.

Yes, exactly.  Because we are relying on things that are not guaranteed
by the C memory model, we need to pay attention to the implementations.
As I have said elsewhere, the price of control dependencies is eternal
vigilance.

And this also applies, to a lesser extent, to address and data
dependencies, which are also not well supported by the C standard.

There is one important case in which the C memory model -does- support
control dependencies, and that is when the dependent write is a normal
C-language write that is not involved in a data race.  In that case,
if the compiler broke the control dependency, it might have introduced
a data race, which it is forbidden to do.  However, this rule can also
be broken when the compiler knows too much, as it might be able to prove
that breaking the dependency won't introduce a data race.  In that case,
according to the standard, it is free to break the dependency.

Agreed, according to the standard, the compiler has great freedom.

We have two choices: (1) Restrict ourselves to live within the confines of
the standard or (2) Pay continued close attention to the implementation.
We have made different choices at different times, but for many ordering
situations we have gone with door #2.

Me, I have been working to get the standard to better support our
use case.  This is at best slow going.  But don't take my word for it,
ask Will.

It is.  It is just that there are multiple valid strategies, and the
Linux kernel is currently taking a mixed-strategy approach.
