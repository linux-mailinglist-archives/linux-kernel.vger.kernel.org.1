You are posting the patch and so you need your SoB too.

I don't quite understand this part of the change.  Why don't you need
to check "req->wait_for_compl" anymore?  You are still setting
"CMD_MSGID_RESP_REQ" if "req->wait_for_compl" is set and none of the
code in your patch actually sets "cmd->wait" (unlike what's implied in
your change to the header file).  Maybe some previous version of the
patch _was_ actually setting "cmd->wait" and when you stopped doing
that you forgot to restore this part of the change?

Should you also be removing the write to RSC_DRV_CMD_WAIT_FOR_CMPL in
both tcs_write() and tcs_invalidate()?  Those are the only two places
left that set this register and they both always set it to 0.

I have a hard time understanding what you're trying to convey here.
Do we even need the "wait" in this structure?

When you call rpmh_write() we use DEFINE_RPMH_MSG_ONSTACK which sets
"wait_for_compl", right?

...so I guess you're expecting this to be used for rpmh_write_async()?
 ...but we never wait in that case, do we?

...or are you expecting rpmh_write_batch() to take advantage of this somehow?

s/commmands/scommands

Also: I don't think this actually goes and modifies "cmd->wait" for
all the commands in the request, does it?  Maybe say "same as setting
cmd->wait for all the commands in the request"?
