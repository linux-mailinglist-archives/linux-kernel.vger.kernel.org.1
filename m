I will check this if i can operate only on PDC and GIC IRQs and can 
ignore PDC-GPIO domain IRQ.
Working on it.

No, for validation of this change, i did below scenario

During a probe of a driver, requested an IRQ and then mark it as wakeup 
capable and disabled it.
 From driver, after probe is done with above operation, we never do any 
enable/disable/wakeup operation.

In above scenario,

1.    if system is in suspend, the IRQ should be kept Enabled in HW
     (since it was marked for wakeup during probe, right?)
2.    if system is out of suspend, the IRQ should be kept disabled in HW
     (since it was disabled in probe, and never again enabled it, right?)

i wanted to test if in HW its Enabled properly during suspend entry
(since we differ status for idle and suspend, in above scenario IRQ 
should be enabled in HW only during suspend
and then when system is out of suspend it should get disabled in HW again)

of course, if we ever woke up from suspend with this wake up capable 
IRQ, the handler will never get called
since its forever marked as disabled in SW but yet the HW is still 
allowed to wake from this IRQ.

yes, we do all this with current patch.

Agree, we do all settings in PDC / GIC HW during deep suspend/ s2idle 
suspend
and revert back to orignal state in HW when coming out of suspend

the lazy doesn't work for GPIO IRQs, gpiolib registers for .irq_disable 
for every gpio chip.

yes i am interested, s2idle is working fine on sc7180.

No internally generic chip also looks using syscore ops 
(irq_gc_syscore_ops)
to invoke generic irq_chip's irq_suspend and irq_resume callbacks

since s2idle still don't call syscore ops, these callback will never get 
invoked
if s2idle suspend is entered.

we are not using suspend ops for same reason, with notifiers this will 
never happen, since we can determine last cpu

1. during s2idle suspend
     for all CPUs cpu_pm notifier will be called. we can determine which 
one is last cpu calling it.

2. during deep suspend
     non-boot cpus get disabled and from last cpu, kernel/cpu_pm.c 
registers for syscore ops and via
    this ops it invokes cpu_pm notification. so we know it is last cpu.

so both cases these will be invoked at very last stage of suspend(be it 
s2idle or deep) when all other drivers are done

and we will never run into above scenario.
