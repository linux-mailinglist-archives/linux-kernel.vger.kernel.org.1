Hi,

I notice that you didn't respond to any of my feedback [1], only
Srinivas's.  Any reason why?  It turns out that Srinivas had quite a
lot of the same feedback as I did, but please make sure you didn't
miss anything I suggested.  More inline below.

I'll let Srinivas comment if he cares.  I'm really not sure why a
legal team cares about the Kconfig name in a GPL-licensed Linux
kernel.

If the underlying IP blocks are the same it should be one driver and
it should just work in read-only mode for the other range of stuff.

Generally I'd expect the SoC specific settings to be in the device
tree.  Drivers don't need to specify this.  Please respond to the
comments I posed in my review.

How are you addressing?  Can you go back to just having one range?  If
you need to know where the raw fuse region is inside your range just
put the offset in the of_match data.

There is harm: it adds extra complexity.  Please remove.

You are talking as if it was somehow important for this code to be the
same as the code on other OSes / in other contexts.  It isn't.  This
is a Linux driver and it should not be written to duplicate stuff that
Linux is already doing.

Please remove your disable here.  Though the user initiates the call
you can still rely on Linux to make sure two users aren't trying to
blow fuses at the same time.  The Linux driver should always leave
things in a "disabled" state and you can rely on that.

...besides the only way you aren't hitting an underflow on the
regulator enable count is that you are constantly enabling over and
over again.

Please remove.  You are a Linux driver.

The driver isn't done until it lands in Linux.  While it's important
to test the driver before posting upstream it is completely expected
and normal that then posting upstream you will be asked to change
things.  After you change things you will need to re-test.  The fact
that you already tested this the old way is not an excuse.  Please
fix.
