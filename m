I'm entirely on the fence about this, so I'm fine with that answer. (And
I see your PS about why -- thanks!)

Right -- a totally sane requirement. :)

GCC only has a signed overflow sanitizer. Clang has signed and unsigned.
Dealing with -fwrapv is yet another exercise.

And I can solve this differently, too, with a static inline helper that does
basic mul and carries a no-sanitize attribute.

(What is the formal name for the ({ ...; return_value; }) C construct?)

Will that work as a macro return value? If so, that's extremely useful.

Ah, gotcha.
