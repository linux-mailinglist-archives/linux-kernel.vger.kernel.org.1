Right. Since one can mix and match the resources of different sizes and 
include them in any order, the onus is going to be on the resource table 
constructors to ensure the inter-resource alignments, if any are 
required. The resource table format allows you to add padding fields in 
between if needed, and the remoteproc core relies on the offsets.

I can only ensure the alignment within this resource structure with 
ready-available access and conversion to/from a 64-bit type, as long as 
the resource is starting on a 64-bit boundary.

Yes, this is one solution. At the same time, this means you need 
additional conversion logic for converting to and from 64-bit field. In 
this particular case, da is the address of the trace buffer pointer on a 
64-bit processor, so we can directly use the address of the trace 
buffer. Guess it is a question of easier translation vs packing the 
resource table as tight as possible.

Anything running out of DDR actually doesn't need the io mem semantics, 
so we actually need to be fixing the drivers. Blindly changing the 
current memcpy to memcpy_to_io in the core loader is also not right. Any 
internal memories properties will actually depend on the processor and 
SoC. Eg: The R5 TCM interfaces in general can be treated as normal memories.
