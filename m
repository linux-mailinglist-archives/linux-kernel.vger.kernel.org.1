Include the test description, data and details of the system you used to
evaluate the patch. I ask because the load/numa reconcilation took a long
time to cover all the corner cases and it's very easy to reintroduce major
regressions. At least one of those corner cases was trying to balance
in the wrong direction because in some cases NUMA balancing will try to
allow a small imbalance if it makes sense from a locality point of view.
Another corner case was if that small imbalance is too large or done at
the wrong time, it regresses overall even though the locality is good
because of memory bandwidth limitations. This is obviously far from ideal
but it does mean that it's an area that needs data backing up the changes.
