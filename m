Actually I did not see any crash with coresight_unregister() during
reboot/shutdown as I mentioned previously to Mathieu's query on
this being similar to remove callback. I think the crash with
coresight_unregister() is only seen when we have coresight as module
and the userspace is pretty much there to enable/disable trace when
we try to bind/unbind. But here we only consider the system 
reboot/shutdown
where pretty much everything is down by this point.

Thanks,
Sai
