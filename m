Yeah, I didn't really want to fork either, but I don't see any other
way around it given the current state of TAP. Seems like if we want an
updated maintained spec that doesn't live in a pull request, then it
is up to us to give it a new home.

Yeah, seeing that everyone seems amenable to the expectation blocks
that KUnit uses in our version of the spec, I don't see any other
reason to keep YAML, and I agree it is probably the least desirable
thing that they have in the spec. So yeah, I am on board with omitting
YAML from KTAP.

I can see (in later emails), why you would say that. On the flip side,
I think that indenting and starting off with "# Subtest: name of the
child test" makes it a lot more readable for a human.

Short answer: The child test.

Long answer: The answer is complicated. From KUnit's perspective the
"parent test" is always just the collection of all test suites. Right
now there is no loop that runs each test suite; each one is a
late_initcall. However, that is something that we are working on
fixing (I really need to get the next version of that patchset out).

Cheers
