Yes, agreed this is second in a row.
So with fast-commit, swap tests returned _not_run, since
swapon syscall returned -EINVAL in _require_scratch_swapfile() itself.
This is due to some old commit in fstests to make swap tests work on
btrfs on both kernels (with and w/o support of swapon in btrfs), it
first checks in _require_scratch_swapfile() to see if swapon even works
or not. Hence it skips to run further if _require_scratch_swapfile()
fails.

Secondly with bmap to iomap interface, I guess it should pass
all tests except for case with fallocate files, which I think is
tests/generic/496. But here too it assumes that if 1st time it fails
with falloc then swapon may not be supported for that fs and hence does
_notrun.

I am actually working on this to make these swap tests return some
definitive pass or failure status. Will be sending some patches soon.
I could use your idea to add a test in shared/NNN for testing swap with
fallocate files for ext4 and xfs (for bmap to iomap ext4 regression
category of tests)

Thanks
