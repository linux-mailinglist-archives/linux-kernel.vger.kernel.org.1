Almost there. As I mentioned, the authori's SOB goes first and the
following SOB lines indicates who forwarded the patch (e.g. you in this
case).

If you also contributed to the patch you (e.g. you added the missing
changelog text) you should also add a Co-developed-by tag as described
in the process document I referred to:

	Co-developed-by: states that the patch was co-created by
	multiple developers; it is a used to give attribution to
	co-authors (in addition to the author attributed by the From:
	tag) when several people work on a single patch.  Since
	Co-developed-by: denotes authorship, every Co-developed-by: must
	be immediately followed by a Signed-off-by: of the associated
	co-author.  Standard sign-off procedure applies, i.e. the
	ordering of Signed-off-by: tags should reflect the chronological
	history of the patch insofar as possible, regardless of whether
	the author is attributed via From: or Co-developed-by:.
	Notably, the last Signed-off-by: must always be that of the
	developer submitting the patch.

	- Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst

So in this case the tags should probably be:

	SOB: Brant
	CDB: Phu
	SOB: Phu

Care to fix that up in a v4 (yes, please increment the patch revision
every time you resubmit)?
