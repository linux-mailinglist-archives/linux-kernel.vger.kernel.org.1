 Explaining the "No working init found." boot hang message

 This document provides some high-level reasons for failure
 (listed roughly in order of execution) to load the init binary.

-1) **Unable to mount root FS**: Set "debug" kernel parameter (in bootloader config file or CONFIG_CMDLINE)
-   to get more detailed kernel messages.

    Try using a different ``console= device`` or e.g. ``netconsole=``.

-4) **Binary exists but dependencies not available**: E.g. required library dependencies of the init binary such as
-   ``/lib/ld-linux.so.2`` missing or broken. Use
-   ``readelf -d <INIT>|grep NEEDED`` to find out which libraries are required.
-
-5) **Binary cannot be loaded**: Make sure the binary's architecture matches your hardware.
-   E.g. i386 vs. x86_64 mismatch, or trying to load x86 on ARM hardware.
-   In case you tried loading a non-binary file here (shell script?),
-   you should make sure that the script specifies an interpreter in its shebang
-   header line (``#!/...``) that is fully working (including its library
-   dependencies). And before tackling scripts, better first test a simple
-   non-script binary such as ``/bin/sh`` and confirm its successful execution.
-   To find out more, add code ``to init/main.c`` to display kernel_execve()s
-   return values.
