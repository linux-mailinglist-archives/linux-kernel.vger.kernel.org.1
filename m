I guess the commit message is ambiguous, that's not what I meant. Is 
"Now that the kernel initializes the iommu, the bypass mappings set by 
the bootloader are cleared. Adding the iommus property is required so 
that new mappings are created for UFS." better?

FYI, I have a branch [1] integrating patches for upstream. All the 
patches up to 34fff8a519cc075933 ("arm64: dts: qcom: add sm8250 GPU 
nodes") have been submitted (and the patches after that are unnecessary 
for testing on sm8150).
