That configuration still produces the same 5 KiB of bloat. I see that 
kernel/time/Kconfig has this --

# Core internal switch. Selected by NO_HZ_COMMON / HIGH_RES_TIMERS. This is
# only related to the tick functionality. Oneshot clockevent devices
# are supported independent of this.
config TICK_ONESHOT
        bool

But my question was really about both kinds of dead code (oneshot device 
support and oneshot tick support). Anyway, after playing with the code for 
a bit I don't see any easy way to reduce the growth in text size.

Is there any benefit from adopting a oneshot tick (rather than periodic) 
if no clocksource is consulted when calculating the next interval? (I'm 
assuming NO_HZ is not in use, for reasons discussed below.)

It probably has to be tried. But consulting a VIA clocksource on every 
tick would be expensive on this platform, so if that was the only way to 
avoid cumulative errors, I'd probably just stick with the periodic tick.

There appear to be 15 platforms in that category. 4 have no clocksource 
besides the jiffies clocksource, meaning there's no practical alternative 
to using a periodic tick, like you did in your RFC patch:

arch/m68k/apollo/config.c
arch/m68k/q40/q40ints.c
arch/m68k/sun3/sun3ints.c
arch/m68k/sun3x/time.c

The other 11 platforms in that category also have 'synthetic' clocksources 
derived from a timer reload interrupt. In 3 cases, the clocksource read 
method does not (or can not) check for a pending counter reload interrupt. 
For these also, I see no practical alternative to the approach you've 
taken in your RFC patch:

arch/m68k/68000/timers.c
arch/m68k/atari/time.c
arch/m68k/coldfire/timers.c

That leaves 8 platforms that have reliable clocksource devices which 
should be able to provide an accurate reading even in the presence of a 
dropped tick (due to drivers disabling interrupts for too long):

arch/arm/mach-rpc/time.c
arch/m68k/amiga/config.c
arch/m68k/bvme6000/config.c
arch/m68k/coldfire/sltimers.c
arch/m68k/hp300/time.c
arch/m68k/mac/via.c
arch/m68k/mvme147/config.c
arch/m68k/mvme16x/config.c

But is there any reason to adopt a oneshot tick on any of these platforms, 
if NO_HZ won't eliminate the timer interrupt that's needed to run a 
'synthetic' clocksource?
