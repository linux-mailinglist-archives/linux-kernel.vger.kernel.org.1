Hi Steven,
 thanks for your rants - and under appreciated art form I believe.

 Short answer is: I don't much care and if someone were to remove the
 markup, I possibly wouldn't even notice and certainly wouldn't object.

 Longer answer is that I think visual appearance is important.  I
 originally wrote that document as an article for lwn.net.  I wanted the
 code fragments - even when a single word like AT_EMPTY_PATH - to be
 rendered like code (constant-width font).  The markdown markup for that
 is  `code goes here`, so that is what I sent to Jon (he graciously uses
 a markdown-to-html tool to munge what I send), and that is what I
 placed in Documentation.
 I subsequently converted this to rst (7bbfd9ad8eb2) which involved
 converting single ` to double ``.
 I agree this was not an improvement when reading the text, but maybe
 that is the price of using rst.  Or maybe the price is not being able
 to say what you mean.

 A brief look over the file suggests that most uses of `` are to
 highlight one of:
    - paths
    - function names
    - constant names.

 All these must be used widely throughout the documentation - whatever
 is the common standard should definitely be imposed.
 Constant names stand out least effectively by themselves.  In
 kernel-doc comments they are preceded by a '%'.  Would that make the
 text more readable for you?  Does our doc infrastructure honour that in
 .rst documents?

Thanks,
NeilBrown
