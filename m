I believe Peter got frustrated with all of the pushback he was
getting, and he moved on to other things. While Google still uses that
code, Aaron's new approach should give us equivalent functionality
without having to comment out the MSRs that kvm previously didn't know
about, and which we still want redirected to userspace.

I do think "the rest" should be explicitly specified, so that
userspace doesn't get surprises when kvm evolves. Maybe this can be
done using the allow-list you refer to later, along with a specified
action for disallowed MSRs: (1) raise #GP, (2) ignore, or (3) exit to
userspace. This actually seems orthogonal to what Aaron is working on,
which is to request that specific MSR accesses exit to userspace. But,
at least the plumbing for {RD,WR}MSR completion when coming back from
userspace can be leveraged by both.
