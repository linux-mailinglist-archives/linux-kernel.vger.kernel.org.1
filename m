There were suggestions that some switches might be useful in general.
You should start with them.

Anyway, it still sounds to me like another lockdown mode. I think that
the relation with lockdown has already been discussed. But I do not
remember if it was refused.

IMHO, it is not strict restriction. The motivation behind the boot
 options is:

   + Create widely useful behavior switches when possible instead of
     crazy hacks all over the kernel code.

   + The changes will modify the existing behavior. Build
     configuration works only when the kernel will be used
     for well defined purpose.

     Boot option is better for (distribution) kernels that are used by
     many different users. The person that builds the kernel does not
     know what behavior would different users prefer.


You might argue that syzbot is a well defined user. But this goes
back to the first motivation to created general purpose options
when possible.

Please, start will single option and you will see how they are
acceptable for the affected subsystem. You could always group them
later.

Anyway, the word "twist" is meaning less. It inspires people to create
hacks that have undefined effects.

IMHO, lockdown would be better but it is already used. Anyway, I
suggest start with independent options for the begining.

PS: This is most likely my last reply in this thread. I feel that I am
just repeating all the already mentioned ideas just by other words.
