I describe it more as:

    if (we_know_there_is_acid_nearby)
        dont_step_forward

It is possible we are currently stepping in acid but it is also possible
(and reasonably likely) that we haven't stepped in it yet but will do so
soon.

The basic use case is where someone is stepping and we reach a PC that
would be blocked for a breakpoint. This will typically be due (although
I think it does generalize) to a function call and the safety rail will
be reached after we have jumped to the blocked function but before we
actually execute any instructions within it.

Or putting it another way, there is no reason to worry if we start
somewhere "safe" and start stepping towards something on the blocklist.
We won't melt our shoes!

There are more complex cases when we drop into the debugger in the
middle of blocked code with a not-breakpoint-or-step trap. You're right
that we'd been in touble and the debugger it probably a bit fragile.
However that certainly doesn't mean blocking stepping at this point
is a bad thing!

As above, I don't think this is needed but if there was an architecture
that did then it can override the default implementation if it wanted
to.

Perhaps off-topic given this isn't why we add the satefy rails but...

I think people who directly set PC should be regarded as very
sophisticated users (and therefore do not need safety rails) so I have
little interest in honouring the blocklist for direct writes to the
PC. More generally sophisticated users should be able to find
KGDB_HONOUR_BLOCKLIST pretty quickly if they need to!

For kgdb this feature is already implemented (next or finish).

I decided between kgdb_arch_pc() and instruction_pointer() based on the
usage of regs in the rest of this file (which is exclusively
instruction_pointer() ). I didn't want the lookup to mismatch what the
user has been told in the console.

On the other hand, I did cross my mind that every PC lookup could be
broken and I made a note for the future...
