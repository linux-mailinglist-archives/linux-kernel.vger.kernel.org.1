Same here, I think this is excellent.

I do think the big masses of contributors have fairly different pain
points and issues from what makes maintainer's lifes hard, so for the
imo very unlikely outcome that this will shift the TAB to be one-sided
representing contributors only, no maintainers, we can easily fix that
by formalizing a subset of the maintainer summit as a permanent thing.
De facto this is how things work anyway, can't merge stuff without
maintainers :-)

Cheers, Daniel
