I went and checked the downstream SDM845 device tree for GPU SMMU and I 
do see this clock listed on there. I am no expert in SMMU either but my 
understanding is that this clock is needed for core working of the SMMU 
like the pagetable walks, TLB invalidations etc, whereas the other two 
clocks are required to access SMMU register space from the host.My 
proposal is to add this clock to SDM845 as well as a follow up effort so 
that we can remove the Min/MaxItems properties which I do not like.

@Jordan, do you remember why this clock was added to SDM845?
