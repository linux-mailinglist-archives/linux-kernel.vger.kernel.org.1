Oh, I should have looked closer at of_dma_configure_id() itself. I was 
assuming that b4bdc4fbf8d0 had been tested and at least *could* work, 
but apparently not :/

Indeed it seems there was a fundamental oversight in e0d072782c73 
("dma-mapping: introduce DMA range map, supplanting dma_pfn_offset"), 
equivalent to the same one I previously made myself with bus_dma_mask 
and fixed in 6778be4e5209 ("of/device: Really only set bus DMA mask when 
appropriate"). I think same simpler fix is the right one for this case 
too, i.e. just move the assignment to dev->dma_range_map up under the 
"if (!ret)" condition. Assigning it this late - after the IOMMU and arch 
setup - looks wrong anyway, even if it isn't currently an issue in 
practice (in principle an IOMMU driver *could* start trying to figure 
out reserved regions around DMA windows for a device as early as its 
.of_xlate callback, even though that's not the intent of the API design).

Luckily dma_range_map hasn't been hooked up in the equivalent ACPI path 
yet, so you're off the hook for fixing that too :)

Cheers,
Robin.
