Well, technically the CLFUSH thing is a KVM emulation bug, but it sounds
like that's a moot point since the pmem-enabled guest will make real
accesses to the poisoned page shortly thereafter.  E.g. teaching KVM to
eat the -EHWPOISON on CLFLUSH would only postpone the guest's death.

As for how the second #MC occurs, on the EPT violation, KVM does a gup() to
translate the virtual address to a pfn (KVM maintains a simple GPA->HVA
lookup).  gup() returns -EHWPOISON for the poisoned page, which KVM
redirects into a BUS_MCEERR_AR.  The userspace VMM, e.g. Qemu, sees the
BUS_MCEERR_AR and sends it back into the guest as a virtual #MC.
