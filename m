Hi Matthew,

Thank a lot for comments!

Sorry, I must overlook sth, would you like point out why the cmpxchg is still
on words after patch 1 applied?

Uh, I am reading compaction.c and found the following commit introduced 
test_and_set_skip under a lock. It looks like the pagelock_flags setting
has false sharing in cmpxchg. but I have no valid data on this yet.

Thanks
