eMMC is not only about voltage levels, but also about enable/disable
of the regulator(s).

More precisely, one needs to follow the steps specified in the eMMC
spec, when disabling the regulator(s).

In other words, the mmc host driver needs to be probed (consumer of
the regulator), before the regulator(s) can be disabled.
