Thanks for the suggestion, and I updated the commit log.

Subject: [PATCH] mm/util.c: remove the VM_WARN_ONCE for vm_committed_as
 underflow check

This check was added by 82f71ae4a2b8 ("mm: catch memory commitment underflow")
in 2014 to have a safety check for issues which have been fixed.
And there has been few report caught by it, as described in its
commit log:

: This shouldn't happen any more - the previous two patches fixed
: the committed_as underflow issues.

But it was really found by Qian Cai when he used the LTP memory
stress suite to test a RFC patchset, which tries to improve scalability
of per-cpu counter 'vm_committed_as', by chosing a bigger 'batch' number
for loose overcommit policies (OVERCOMMIT_ALWAYS and OVERCOMMIT_GUESS),
while keeping current number for OVERCOMMIT_NEVER.

With that patchset, when system firstly uses a loose policy, the
'vm_committed_as' count could be a big negative value, as its big 'batch'
number allows a big deviation, then when the policy is changed to
OVERCOMMIT_NEVER, the 'batch' will be decreased to a much smaller value,
thus hits this WARN check.

To mitigate this, one proposed solution is to queue work on all online
CPUs to do a local sync for 'vm_committed_as' when changing policy to
OVERCOMMIT_NEVER, plus some global syncing to garante the case won't
be hit.

But this solution is costy and slow, given this check hasn't shown real
trouble or benefit, simply drop it from one hot path of MM. And perf
stats does show some tiny saving for removing it.
