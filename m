You really have to look beyond just what Graphene guarantees at this
point; it does not live on it's own island and it's success isn't
measured purely based on how well it handles it's threat model.

Yes, the threat model assumes the kernel was rooted, but you don't go
off and set the root password to '12345678' on those machines, right?
Attackers would be more than happy to run botnets, spam mailers, and
host child porn on your servers if you give them the opportunity, let's
not do that.

I'm really worried about the disconnect between how you view the current
state of Graphene (and the industry) vs Intel and the various cloud
providers.

You keep suggesting that its just past the academic research state,
while Intel and the big cloud providers are already pushing it to
external customers.  Every one of those cloud providers has a preview/GA
secure enclave offering.
