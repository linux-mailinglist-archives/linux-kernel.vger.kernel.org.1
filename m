Actually, I'm pretty sure that patch #1 of Wei Li's patch series would
still be needed.  Would you object to landing it now just to get one
patch outta the way?

Thanks for the pointer!  Unfortunately this is yet another area that
I'm keenly interested in it working but pretty much clueless about how
this whole area of the system works.  :-|

My first question, though, is why would we want interrupts enabled
while we're single stepping?  If you're trying to get the processor to
just step one instruction forward you don't really want a bunch of
IRQs going off in the middle of it, do you?  While in kgdb and
debugging the kernel I would assume that a single step would run the
very least amount of code that it could (other than debugger code).
In general every time I exit kgdb (and re-start running the kernel
normally) I sorta assume that there's a chance that something in the
system will hit a timeout (maybe it's talking to external hardware
that will give up or something).  If I'm stepping through code I just
want that little bit of code I'm running to move forward and the rest
of the kernel to stand still.  If I want the rest of the kernel to
proceed I guess I'd set a breakpoint and then say "continue".

It seemed like with Wei Li's patch that we were closing holes and
being more consistent about keeping interrupts disabled when stepping
and I liked that.  Maybe if we made it so that taking interrupts
didn't break everything then it would be _OK_ to let them fire, but if
I had a choice I'd rather they didn't.

...of course, I'm looking at all this from the point of view of kgdb.
I don't know nearly enough about how other parts of the kernel use
single step to comment much on what would be best for them.


Did what I said make sense at all, or was it gibberish?  ...or not
gibberish but not what you were looking for?
