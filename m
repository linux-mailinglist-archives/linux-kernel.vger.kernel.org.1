Hi! Since I got dropped from the thread, many responses inline

no need - currently because of some confusion that got caused by the Intel HDR
backlight interface being the only backlight interface that works properly on
a lot of panels (many panels will advertise both interfaces, but might only
work with the Intel one), we actually rely on a small allowlist of "approved"
panels for enabling DPCD backlight control.

â€¦however, many of these panels are annoying and don't actually provide a
reliable enough OUID to use for quirk detection, which is why we had to add
EDID quirk detection as a temporary workaround for this. The current list of
panels lives in drm_dp_helper.c:

/*
 * Some devices have unreliable OUIDs where they don't set the device ID
 * correctly, and as a result we need to use the EDID for finding additional
 * DP quirks in such cases.
 */
static const struct edid_quirk edid_quirk_list[] = {
	/* Optional 4K AMOLED panel in the ThinkPad X1 Extreme 2nd Generation
	 * only supports DPCD backlight controls
	 */
	{ MFG(0x4c, 0x83), PROD_ID(0x41, 0x41), BIT(DP_QUIRK_FORCE_DPCD_BACKLIGHT) },
	/*
	 * Some Dell CML 2020 systems have panels support both AUX and PWM
	 * backlight control, and some only support AUX backlight control. All
	 * said panels start up in AUX mode by default, and we don't have any
	 * support for disabling HDR mode on these panels which would be
	 * required to switch to PWM backlight control mode (plus, I'm not
	 * even sure we want PWM backlight controls over DPCD backlight
	 * controls anyway...). Until we have a better way of detecting these,
	 * force DPCD backlight mode on all of them.
	 */
	{ MFG(0x06, 0xaf), PROD_ID(0x9b, 0x32), BIT(DP_QUIRK_FORCE_DPCD_BACKLIGHT) },
	{ MFG(0x06, 0xaf), PROD_ID(0xeb, 0x41), BIT(DP_QUIRK_FORCE_DPCD_BACKLIGHT) },
	{ MFG(0x4d, 0x10), PROD_ID(0xc7, 0x14), BIT(DP_QUIRK_FORCE_DPCD_BACKLIGHT) },
	{ MFG(0x4d, 0x10), PROD_ID(0xe6, 0x14), BIT(DP_QUIRK_FORCE_DPCD_BACKLIGHT) },
	{ MFG(0x4c, 0x83), PROD_ID(0x47, 0x41), BIT(DP_QUIRK_FORCE_DPCD_BACKLIGHT) },
};

Also note that I think just about every panel on that list supports the Intel
HDR backlight interface, so it's -possible- that the VESA interface could be
broken on these panels. But, that would be a lot of different panels from
different vendors to all be broken in the same way.

Honestly I'm not hard to convince :P, if it looks like we got the bit shift
wrong for the majority of devices and everyone else agrees then I'm fine with
assuming that's the case. I'm just quite surprised, seeing as we've tested
many different panels from a few vendors and haven't run into any issues with
this before.

Honestly - if there's this much uncertainty about it, maybe we should just ask
VESA directly what the correct interpretation of this is? Note I'm not on the
VESA board (I get access to DP/eDP specs through X.org) so unless the contacts
I've got from VESA would work (Bill Lempesis bill at vesa dot org) for that it
might be a better idea for someone from Google or Intel to ask.

Usually, I just try to stick with what the majority of machines need to do. I
still think it'd be a good idea for us to verify this with VESA if there's
that much confusion though
