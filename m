Do we really want the exception handling to do the CLAC?  Having
unsafe_get_user() do CLAC seems surprising to me, and it will break
use cases like:

if (!user_access_begin(...)
  goto out;

ret = unsafe_get_user(...);

user_access_end();

check ret;

I have no problem with a special ex_handler_uaccess_clac, but I don't
think it should be the default.
