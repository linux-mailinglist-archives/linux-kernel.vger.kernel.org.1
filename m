Lets try to find the root of misunderstanding, shall we?

I'm assuming that your statement is encapsulated to:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-sgx/32fc9df4-d4aa-6768-aa06-0035427b7535@intel.com/

I do agree with this.

And here is a direct quote:

"It is also stashed off and then later compared with enclave PTEs to
ensure that any future mmap()/mprotect() operations performed by the
enclave creator or the enclave itself are consistent with the earlier
declared permissions."

Without the mprotect callback in place, by using EMODPE and mprotect,
one could surpass the permisssions that we declared earlier.

With the callback in place this is not possible. EMODPE can be freely
used but mprotect() always caps the permissions. It enables us to *not
care* about EMODPE.

My problem is that I fully agree what you say in your description but
disagree on that EMODPE should not be mentioned.

Not sure if it is or not. It is merely to state that execve() path is
possible. Perhaps should be toned down in some way. Should be like the
a small remark at most.

Agreed.

Yes, this should be refined, agreed. Source can be either anonymous page
or a file, I do of course understand that.

Agreed.

Disagree on this. I wrote my statement about. Maybe it should not be
driving argument but should be definitely part of the description.

Yes it is. It's fine to use EMODPE to upgrade the perms, and by having
this hook, doing anything nasty with it is impossible.

I should have added a disclaimer that my description is not up to date.
Just do not want to make anything final before this EMODPE discussion
has some conclusion.

I'm fine using your description as basis for the commit message if as long
as these few details are settled.
