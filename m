Could you drop me your config, please? I need to dig here a little and I
should have seen this on qemu, right?

I dropped that patch in v5.4.3-rt1. I couldn't reproduce the issue that
was documented in the patch and the code that triggered the warning was
removed / reworked in commit
    b5466f8728527 ("ARM: mm: remove IPI broadcasting on ASID rollover")

So it looked like no longer needed and then got dropped during the
rebase.
In order to get it back into the RT queue I need to understand why it is
required. What exactly is it fixing. Let me stare at for a littleâ€¦
