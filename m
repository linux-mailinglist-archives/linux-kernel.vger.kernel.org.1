Which path do you suppose that the unbind should be called from, remove
callback? Here we are talking about the drivers which are builtin, where
remove callbacks are not called from the driver core during 
reboot/shutdown,
instead shutdown callbacks are called which needs to be defined in order 
to
trigger unbind. So AFAICS there is nothing to be fixed.

msm_pdev_shutdown()
  platform_drv_shutdown()
   device_shutdown()
    kernel_restart_prepare()
     kernel_restart()
      __arm64_sys_reboot()

Thanks,
Sai
