I think PV is much more easy on that regard, as it doesn't have MMIO
holes except when using PCI passthrough, and in that case it's
trivial to identify those.

However on HVM/PVH this is not so trivial. I'm certainly not opposing
to a solution that covers both, but ATM I would really like to get
something working for PVH dom0, or else it's not usable on Linux IMO.

Right, we could use the native memory map for that on dom0, and maybe
create a custom resource for the Xen balloon driver instead of
allocating from iomem_resource?

DomUs are more tricky as a guest has no idea where mappings can be
safely placed, maybe we will have to resort to iomem_resource in that
case, as I don't see much other option due to the lack of information
from Xen.

I also think that ZONE_DEVICE will need some adjustments, for once the
types in memory_type don't seem to be suitable for Xen, as they are
either specific to DAX or PCI. I gave a try at using allocate_resource
plus memremap_pages but that didn't seem to fly, I will need to
investigate further.

Maybe we can resort to something even simpler than memremap_pages? I
certainly have very little idea of how this is supposed to be used,
but dev_pagemap seems overly complex for what we are trying to
achieve.

Thanks, Roger.
