The dma heap API itself (what makes it specific to DMA, rather than any
special-purpose allocator?) seems like it could be what we're looking for. 
The issue with drivers/misc/sram.c is that it seems like its main purpose is
to get sram description from the device tree, but this sram isn't static (it's
a reconfiguration of L2 cache into SRAM mode) and thus can't be described by
mmio-sram.
