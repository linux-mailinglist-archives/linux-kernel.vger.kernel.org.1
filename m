But the provider does not know if *get is called in probe context or 
not, so it is not able to differentiate it.

So the whole idea is for me suspicious/wrong. Kind of proof:

1. If you insist that provider's EPROBE_ERROR must be always propagated 
to driver core then.

2. You must enforce that resources can be gathered only from probe.

3. But this is against current practice, even if majority of drivers 
does it from probe, there are many which doesn't.

QED :)


So if you really want to go this way it would be good to look at these 
drivers, check why they do it this way, and try to convert them.

But I do not think it is a good way.
