Good luck!  :)

Ok, yes, that makes more sense now, thank you.

Then you are going to have problems, that is exactly what flow control
was designed for.  To ignore that is to have problems.

Also, there is software flow control when you do not have any control
lines.  This "issue" was solved decades ago :)

Again, usb-serial devices do not use a uart on the host, so they have a
totally different design and code flow.

Then that is a design mistake, please fix that.

good luck!
