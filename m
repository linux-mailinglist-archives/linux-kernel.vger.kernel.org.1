A TID, I think. If you pass your own TID, you tag yourself as
not-sharing. If you tag yourself with another tasks's TID, you can do
ptrace tests to see if you're allowed to observe their junk.

As a corrolary yes. I mostly meant that a blanket 'enable' doesn't
specify a 'who' you're sharing your bits with.

Yeah, but I think that same guy said that that was a shit interface and
only hacked up because it was easy :-)

For #2 I think I prefer failure.

But having the rationale spelled out in documentation (man-pages for
example) is important.

With the TID idea above you get the ptrace tests.
