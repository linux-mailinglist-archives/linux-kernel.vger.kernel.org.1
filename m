Debug.  Debug.  Debug. ;)  The parameter was added to debug broken installations
and kernel boots.

Not the generation of the initramfs, but blocking a module loaded during the
boot.  The installation may have failed and there's no easy way to then debug
what module was responsible for the failure.

Both of those options only work if the filesystem is mounted IIRC.  It could be
the case that modprobe.blacklist now works earlier in the boot, however, I've
never used it because module_blacklist is the biggest and best hammer that I can
use to get through a broken installation or boot.

In any case you're incorrectly assuming that the system has a filesystem on it.
That's not necessarily the case as I'll explain below.

This is the situation I have repeatedly come across :  A system at a remote site
will not boot any flavor of Linux.  Since the system would not install the only
way to debug was to provide install images to workaround a module load failure.
As you can imagine that is a time consuming process as well as a bad end user
experience.

I got so sick of it that I wrote the code above (well similar to it anyway --
thanks for the review Randy ;)) to add the module_blacklist parameter to make
debugging an uninstallable "bricked" system easier.

It's come in handy in some unexpected ways.  We've had situations where modules
have loaded and corrupted memory and blacklisting them revealed that the modules
were responsible for the memory corruption.
