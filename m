Unless I misread Baoquan's explanation we do have struct pages for e820
resrved memory, but they are properly linked to their node and zone and
marked as reserved.

Before the commit memmap_init_zone() looped over all pfns in node in
zone and the reserved pages were passed to __init_single_page with node
and zone where their pfn belongs.

Afterwards, free_low_memory_core_early() reserved them because they were
present in memblock.reserved and form here on nothing would touch them.

After the commit, we skip over the holes in memblock.memory during
memmap_init_zone() which leaves the zone and node link zeroed for e820
reserved pages and that evetually triggers
VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(!zone_spans_pfn(page_zone(page), pfn)).

I think that simpler fix would be to have e820 reserved ranges
reigstered as memory in memblock and not only as reserved. If we will
have these regions in both memblock.memory and memblock.reserved the
struct pages for them will be properly initialized as reserved.
