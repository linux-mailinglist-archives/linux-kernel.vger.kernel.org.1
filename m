I understand that if a particular user (zonefs, btrfs etc) is not
sending regular-write and sending append instead, write-lock is not
required.
But if that particular user or some other user (say F2FS) sends
regular write(s), write-lock is needed.
Above block-layer, both the opcodes REQ_OP_WRITE and
REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND are available to be used by users. And I thought
write-lock is taken or not is a per-opcode thing and not per-user (FS,
MD/DM, user-space etc.), is not that correct? And MQ-deadline can
cater to both the opcodes, while other schedulers cannot serve
REQ_OP_WRITE well for zoned-device.

Sure I can keep it that way, once I get it right. If it is really not
required for native-append drive, it should not be here at the place
where I added.

Are we saying applications should switch schedulers based on the write
QD  (use any-scheduler for QD1 and mq-deadline for QD-N).
Even if it does that, it does not know what other applications would
be doing. That seems hard-to-get-right and possible only in a
tightly-controlled environment.
