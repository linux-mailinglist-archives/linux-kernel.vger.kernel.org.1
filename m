Yes I see this too as we call replicator_reset() in probe. What I wanted 
to highlight was the below part where it is set to 0x0 before enabling 
dynamic replicator.

That is right.

I was trying to narrow down further as you suggested. There are other 
ETMs like AOP ETM which use this replicator, will need to check with the 
firmware team for details.
