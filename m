In case your "why" refers to why I stated that the KDF implementations are=
=20
similar to eventually consolidate them into a template eventually:

A KDF is conceptually a logic on top of a (hash) algorithm like a block=20
chaining mode on top of a block cipher or a deterministic RNG on top of an=
=20
underlying cipher.

So, conceptually with the kernel crypto API, we would have a KDF template t=
hat=20
can be used like hkdf(sha256) or hkdf(sha256-avx2).

The behavior of a KDF is identical to a deterministic RNG. Thus, a long tim=
e=20
ago, I had a patch developed that adds a very small addition to the existin=
g=20
RNG API to allow the KDFs to be used. See [1]. Yet, that was not desired at=
=20
the time due to different reasons.

Yet, the crypto API as it stands today knows of templates and basic=20
algorithms. Having a separate library API providing a crypto algorithm is n=
ew=20
to the crypto API. You see that with the test manager which works well with=
=20
the templates / algorithms but does not provide any helpers for some "libra=
ry=20
APIs".



In case your "why" refers to whether I am not using a template to begin wit=
h:

Some time back I provided the patch using a template (see [1] for example).=
 At=20
that time, Herbert wanted to have a service API instead.
