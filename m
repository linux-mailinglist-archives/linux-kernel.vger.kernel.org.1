I don't think so, but again, that code is not trivial to follow. I do
know that the MDS keeps around a "strays directory" which contains
unlinked inodes that are lazily cleaned up. My suspicion is that it's
satisfying lookups out of this cache as well.

Which may be fine...the MDS is not required to be POSIX compliant after
all. Only the fs drivers are.

No, that shouldn't happen. The caps mechanism should ensure that it
can't be observed by other clients until after the change.

That said, Luis' current patch doesn't ensure we have the correct caps
to check the i_nlink. We may need to add that in before we can roll with
this.

No. Open files in ceph are generally per-client. You can't pass around a
fd (or equivalent).

Got it. That makes sense.

I'm leaning toward something like what Luis has proposed, but adding in
appropriate cap handling.

Basically, we have to consider the situation where one client has the
file open and another client unlinks it, and then does an
open_by_handle_at. Should it succeed in that case?

I can see arguments for either way.
