Ah, I was about to say this is something that Kate keeps reminding me
to add to the wiki, but looking, I already did!

https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/start

"Tagging policy of the PREEMPT_RT stable releases. Each PREEMPT_RT
stable release is tagged with the version number of the upstream Linux
stable kernel as well as its own “-rt” counter that is appended. The
-rt counter will increment for the following:

 - When forward ported to the latest upstream Linux stable version.
 - When any merge with a upstream Linux stable causes a conflict.
 - When a backport of the PREEMPT_RT development branch is done.

A backport will not be done with a forward port of a stable version.
They will be done separately, and tagged separately."

Tom, I sign all tags, we probably should be consistent with that too.
