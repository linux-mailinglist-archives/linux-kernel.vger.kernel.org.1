you have reverted only this patch ?

TBH, there is no link between these 2 metrics and I don't see how the
init value of runnable_avg can impact loadavg. As explained, loadavg
is doing a snapshot of nr_running every 5 seconds whereas the impact
of changing this init value will have disappeared in far less than
300ms most of the time.

Let me try to reproduce this on my system
