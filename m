FWIW, I retested my sparc32 patches with PREEMPT=y and I don't see any
issues. However, linux-next is a different story, where I don't get very far
at all:

BUG: Bad page state in process swapper  pfn:005b4

If you're seeing this on powerpc too, I wonder if it's related to:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200514170327.31389-1-rppt@kernel.org

since I think it just hit -next and the diffstat is all over the place. I've
added Mike to CC just in case.
