Lima ('Utgard') has separate units for geometry and pixel processing 
(GP/PP). For Panfrost ('Midgard'/'Bifrost') we don't have that 
separation, however there are multiple job slots. which are implemented 
as multiple DRM schedulers. So the same fix is appropriate, but clearly 
I missed this comment because it's referring to GP/PP which don't exist 
for Midgard/Bifrost.

Technically this is a fix - there's a small race which could cause the 
devfreq information to become corrupted. However it would resolve itself 
on the next devfreq interval when panfrost_devfreq_reset() is called. So 
the impact is very minor (devfreq gets some bogus figures). The 
important variable (busy_count) was already an atomic so won't be affected.
