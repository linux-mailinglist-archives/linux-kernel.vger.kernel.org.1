Yes, so perhaps a more generalized summary of the feature is that is simply places a per-task maximum number of 
iterations on the various 'for_each_cpu' loops (whose max is platform dependent) in this path. Any other technique to 
short circuit the loop below this max would be fine including the fact that the very first 'idle' check in a loop may 
succeed and that is perfectly ok in terms of minimizing the search latency. This really only kicks in on busy systems 
and while system or scheduling domain wide heuristics can reduce the cost to tasks for not doing something per-task like 
this, they can't drive the loop iteration search to 0 because that is BAD policy when applied to the wrong tasks or too 
many tasks.

Agreed and I hope I've clarified how the attribute in question should not affect that as the default for the attribute 
is basically "no short cut because of this", other heuristics may apply.
