Before the commit  8a931f801340c2be ("mm: memcontrol: recursive
memory.low protection"), the A1's elow should be 0, while after this
commit A1's elow is 2G.
That is a behavior change.

Then this case gives us another example why accessing emin and elow in
the very deap reclaiming code (get_scan_count) is the root of ALL
EVIL.
