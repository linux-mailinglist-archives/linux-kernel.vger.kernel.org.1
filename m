Applied with a few additional updates as shown below.  As always, please
let me know if I messed anything up.

    rcu: Clarify nocb kthreads naming in RCU_NOCB_CPU config
    
    This commit clarifies that the "p" and the "s" in the in the RCU_NOCB_CPU
    config-option description refer to the "x" in the "rcuox/N" kthread name.
