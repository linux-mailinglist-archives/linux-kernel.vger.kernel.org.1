Kernel bug is not a legit condition. Neither is a silicon failure. We do
not document speculated kernel bugs. If we used that kind of pattern for
documentation, we would have to put similar statements about every
single line of code.

Describing legit failure conditions with the best knowledge available is
the whole point why people read documentation in the first place.
Otherwise, the documentation has absolutely no value.

Documentation is also always, without exception, inaccurate. Lacking
something is not an issue, if it is not done on purpose.

I'd refine what I did as

"The function deinitializes enclave and returns -EIO when EPC was lost,
 while entering to a new power cycle, or any other condition where EPC
 gets invalidated."

It is not perfect, nothing ever is, but it is heck a lot more useful
than being too generic to fail.

To have understandable semantics you have to map error codes to
conditions rather than opcodes. -EIO means loss of enclave in the event
of EPC gone invalid. Enclave is already lost, that is the reason why we
deinitialize the kernel data structures.

EADD must have a different error code because nothing is actually lost
but the failure conditions are triggered outside. -EFAULT would be
probably the most reasonable choice for that.
