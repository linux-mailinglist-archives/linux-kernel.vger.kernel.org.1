Hi,

lemme try to reply to three emails at once.

First of all, the two of you: pls do not top-post.

So Jue says below that the VMM has unmapped the guest page from the EPT.
So the guest cannot touch the poison anymore.

How is then possible for the guest to touch it again if the page is not
mapped anymore?

The guest should get a #PF when the page is unmapped and cause a new
page to be mapped.

Aha, so you've flipped the functions order in the trace. It all starts
at

  set_mce_nospec(m->addr >> PAGE_SHIFT);

Now it makes sense.

Ok, good.

So IIUC that set_mce_nospec() thing should check whether m->addr is
mapped first and only then mark it _uc and whatever monkey business it
does. Not this blanket

  if am I a guest?

test.

Imagine a hypervisor which doesn't set X86_FEATURE_HYPERVISOR, i.e.,
CPUID(1)[EDX, bit 31]?

Thx.
