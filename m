Are you sure it prevents that?  Where is the lock that handles dropping
a reference count and incrementing it at the same time?

krefs are not "lock free" entirely, they need to have some type of other
control somewhere to prevent foolish things from happening :)

But don't do that by checking a kref value.  You should never care about
the value of it, that is not how you use it at all, and one reason I
hate that function is even present in the kernel...
