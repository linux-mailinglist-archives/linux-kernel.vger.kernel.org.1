It's not for just one such situation, we have already had one to warn
out in mm/hugetlb.c, please check hugetlb_hstate_alloc_pages().

As Mike said, in one time of persistent huge page number setting,
comparing the old value with the new vlaue is good enough for customer
to get the information. However, if customer want to detect and analyze
previous setting failure, logging message will be helpful. So I think
logging the failure or partial success makes sense.

Thanks
