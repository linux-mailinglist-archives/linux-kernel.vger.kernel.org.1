It is much better to have an irqchip structure per irqchip type,
rather than one per instance, as you can then make the irqchip const.
It also saves memory when you have more than a single instance.

The only case where it doesn't work is when PM gets involved, as the
parent_device pointer is stupidly stored in the irqchip device.

Yes, a spinlock is the conventional way to solve it. Make sure
you use the irqsave/irqrestore versions, as mask/unmask can
also occur whilst in interrupt context.

It is indeed the 16bit accesses that reminded me of the MTK
code, as that's very unusual.

Hopefully you can work with the MTK guys to resolve this quickly.
