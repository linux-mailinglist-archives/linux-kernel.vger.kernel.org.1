It's in the commit as comments, but I'll copy it here too for clarity.

I'm confused why this isn't an error path.  We're about to return a
non-zero value from the function (indicating an error) and we didn't
actually do the write.  Isn't this an error path?

In any case, "unlock" is fine with me so I'll change it, but maybe you
can help clarify so I don't make the same mistake next time.

I was referring to the __tcs_set_trigger() function call two lines
below.  I'll clarify.
