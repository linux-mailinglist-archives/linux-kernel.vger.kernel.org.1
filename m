Marc suggested to use SDEI in another reply. I think it might be the
appropriate way to deliver page-not-present. To some extent, it could
be regarded as exception, which doesn't use ESR at all. It matches with
what Paolo is thinking of: paravirtualized exception vector that doesn't
use ESR at all. However, it seems it's not supported in kvm-arm yet. So
I assume it needs to be developed from scratch. Marc, could you please
help to confirm? Thanks in advance.

I agree with Paolo PPI (interrupt) might be the best way to deliver
page-ready currently. I don't think SDEI is suitable because there
are no big difference between SDEI and currently used DABT injection
to some extent. With SDEI, We will have the issues we are facing.
For example, some critical code section isn't safe to receive SDEI
if I'm correct.


Thanks,
Gavin
