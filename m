Subject: [PATCH v3 12/13] arm64: Add fixup routines for usercopy load exceptions
Date:   Thu, 14 May 2020 14:32:26 +0000

This adds the fixup routines for exceptions that occur on load
operations while copying, by providing the calling code with a more
accurate value for the number of bytes that failed to copy.

The three routines for load exceptions work together to analyse
the position of the fault relative to the start or the end of the
buffer, and backtrack from the optimized memcpy algorithm to
determine if some number of bytes has already been successfully
copied.

The new template uses out-of-order copying, and this fixup routine is
specific to the latest memcpy implementation. It is assumed there is
no requirement to follow through with the copying of data that may
reside in temporary registers on a fault, as this would greatly
increase the fixup's complexity.
