Sorry. The last meeting's agenda was derailed for numerous reasons.
Are you okay with discussing this during the next meeting ?
I have not scheduled one yet but will probably schedule it on next
Wednesday (8th July) if there is no objection.
I can check with Anup if he can present the SBI PMU extension as well.
