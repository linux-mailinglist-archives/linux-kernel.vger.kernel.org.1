Hello Andrew! With "fixes" I mean that this patch fixes aliases list in
that mentioned commit as it was incomplete. Probably better would be
"related" or "extended" keyword in this case. But I do not know.

I would not say it is a "new feature". But rather that patch in this
email fixes issue that Linux kernel did not set correct MAC address for
DSA slave ports. I think it is something which could be backported also
to stable releases as "ignoring" vendor/factory MAC address is not
correct behavior.

If you have an idea how to reformulate commit description I will do it.
