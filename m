This seems to be an orthogonal change against what this series tried to do.  We
use host_initiated=true in current code, and this series won't change that fact
either.  As I mentioned in the other thread, at least the rdmsr warning is
ambiguous when it's not initiated from the guest if without this patchset, and
this series could address that.

Yeah I can add another patch for that.  Also if to repost, I tend to also
introduce KVM_MSR_RET_[OK|ERROR] too, which seems to be cleaner when we had
KVM_MSR_RET_INVALID.

Any objections before I repost?
