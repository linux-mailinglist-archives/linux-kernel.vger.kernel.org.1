Oh, so it isn't even the SPI controller, just a flash chip hanging off
a random SPI controller, or possibly something else. I suppose it could
be any MFD device, or possibly something different.

The problem is more the namespace: as the driver has almost nothing
to do with spi, this is not what the function should be named. The other
problem is that the function should not really exist in the first place,
as no driver has any business reading the register base of a random
other device that already has a driver.

To answer all the above points: This needs to be in a driver, and
in case of pch, that driver is drivers/mtd/spi-nor/intel-spi.c.

This driver already has access to the registers you need, and the
information you pass corresponds to the devices that this driver
manages, which in turn is where user space would logically search
for it. You can read the registers in the intel_spi_probe() function
and then add attributes to the mtd device in sysfs.

I think a good way to handle this in a generic way would be to add
members to the mtd_info structure and then have the attributes
created by the mtd core code for any device that initializes those
struct members, along with the existing 'type', 'size', 'flags',  etc
attributes.
