Thanks for sending the section info.

The cros-ec-typec driver only receives a USB_PD_MUX_INFO [1] host
command after we've
already entered the mode as far as PD communication is concerned
(steps 1-5 and even PD communication
to enter the mode is already done by the time cros-ec-typec receives
PD_MUX_INFO).
There is no further PD communication to be done in this case (for a
particular mode), at least nothing that
is triggered by the AP.

I apologize but I still didn't see anything there enforcing an
ordering for those on any AP switches. The state
machine you're referring to ((I assume you are referring to Figure
4-12 to Figure Figure 4-18)
is already implemented in the TCPM in the Chrome EC for the Chrome OS
Platform [2]

Perhaps we can take that discussion off-mailing list if necessary ?
(I'd like to avoid blasting the large mailing list
with more discussion email, but also happy to continue here if that's
the preference).

To be clear, all these comments are limited to the only Chrome OS platform.

My response was w.r.t section 2.3 (the section which was originally
quoted) which deals
with things like:
"
- Source-to-Sink attach/detach detection
- Plug orientation/cable twist detection
- Detect if cable requires Vconn
"
etc.

All these things are performed by the Chrome OS EC (via TCPM or the TCPC).
For the items listed in Section 4.5.1.2, AFAIK those steps are
performed by the Chrome OS EC (via
a combination of the TCPM and TCPC).

I agree with this, but since the role of TCPM is performed by the
Chrome EC, I'm not convinced this patch is
addressing any spec related ordering requirements.

As I mentioned above, the Chrome OS EC is following the state machine
as well as the section
of the spec you referred to.

I would suggest:
- Merging Patch 1 (role set correction) and Patch 2 (moving the
usb_role_switch_set_role() inside cros_typec_configure_mux()
*but* keep it at the end to preserve existing ordering) into 1 patch.
- Add another patch which re-orders the calls and which in the commit
message lists out all the reasons why this re-ordering
needs to be done.

Doing the above will help keep better track of why the changes were made.
