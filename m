Yes.  "High", i.e. asserted, means "termination enabled" in the case of
my patch and "receiver enabled" in the case of Heiko's patch.

For termination, the default is "low", i.e. termination disabled.
I talked to our hardware engineers and they said that disabling
termination by default is the safe choice:  If multiple devices
on the RS485 bus enable termination, then no communication may
be possible at all.  Whereas if termination is disabled,
communication should always work at least for short cables.
And for longer cables, users may have to disable it using the
TIOCSRS485 ioctl.

In the case of Heiko's patches, the default is "high", i.e.
the receiver is enabled by default so you're able to receive
data over the bus after opening the tty.  Once you start
transmitting, the GPIO may be switched to low for the duration
of the transmission if half-duplex mode is enabled.

Thanks,

Lukas
