So I spent a good chunk of today looking the code over and what I
realized is that we probably don't even really need to have this code
protected by the zone lock since the LRU bit in the pageblock should
do most of the work for us. In addition we can get rid of the test
portion of this and just make it a set only operation if I am not
mistaken.

I don't think that patch helps to address anything. You are now
failing to set the bit in the case that something modifies the
pageblock flags while you are attempting to do so. I think it would be
better to just leave the cmpxchg loop as it is.

I can rebase off of that tree. It may add another half hour or so. I
have barely had any time to test my code. When I enabled some of the
debugging features in the kernel related to using the vm-scalability
tests the boot time became incredibly slow so I may just make certain
I can boot and not mess the system up before submitting my patches as
an RFC. I can probably try testing them more tomorrow.

Yes and no. The same code is also ran outside the lock and that is why
I suggested merging the two and creating this block of logic. It will
be clearer once I have done some initial smoke testing and submitted
my patch.

So I thought that the call to page_ref_freeze that is used in
functions like split_huge_page_to_list is meant to address this case.
What it is essentially doing is setting the reference count to zero if
the count is at the expected value. So with the get_page_unless_zero
it would either fail because the value is already zero, or the
page_ref_freeze would fail because the count would be one higher than
the expected value. Either that or I am still missing another piece in
the understanding of this.

Thanks.
