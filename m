What I meant, but did probably not find a good way to say it.

There are places where credentials of other threads are written,
e.g. set no new privs on a thread, that already started to execve
a setuid process.

You always have the right to change the credentials of the own thread,
you dont need a mutex for it.

This is at least what is my impression how the existing mutexes are used,
a mutex called "cred_guard_mutex" is a not very good self explaining name,
in my opinion, it is totally unclear what it does "guard", and why.
