The problem here is priority inversion, not latency: Android runs
surface-flinger as SCHED_FIFO, so when surfaceflinger does something it
can preempt the kernel's commit work, and we miss a frame. Apparently
otherwise the soft-rt of just having a normal worker (with maybe elevated
niceness) seems nice enough.

Aside: I just double-checked, and vblank work has a per-crtc kthread.
