But clearing TASKLET_STATE_RUN independently happens by the task, that
set it / part of tasklet_schedule().
tasklet_tryunlock() does a cmpxchg() with only the RUN bit so it won't
work if the additional CHAINED bit is set.

The tasklet itself (which may run on another CPU) sets the RUN bit at the
begin and clears it at the end via cmpxchg() together with the CHAINED
bit. 

I've been staring at it for sometime and I don't see how this can
happen.
