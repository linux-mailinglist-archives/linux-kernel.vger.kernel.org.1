Hi all.

I try to suggest the Block Layer Interposer (blk_interposer) again.
It`s allows to intercept bio requests, remap bio to another devices
or add new bios.

Initially, blk_interposer was designed to be compatible with
device mapper. Our (my and Hannes) previous attempt to offer
blk_interposer integrated with device mapper did not receive
any comments from the dm-devel team, and without their help
I will not be able to make a full implementation. I hope later
they will have time to support blk_interposer in device mapper.

And my blk-snap module requires an architecture change to
support blk_interposer.

This time I offer it along with a sample.
Despite the fact that blk_interposer is quite simple,
there are a few non-obvious points that I would like to clarify.

However, I suggest the blk_interposer now so that people
could discuss it and use it in their projects as soon as possible.
