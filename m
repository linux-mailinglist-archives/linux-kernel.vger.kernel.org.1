Checked.

That is because with the patch both lib.mk and x86/Makefile add
the $(OUTPUT) prefix.

So the question is to agree about the convention, should lib.mk
targets expect short test names for TEST_PROGS or full path from
the subtests' Makefiles.

The existing code is hackish (incorrectly -- adding $(OUTPUT)
only to the first list members -- tries to handle it only for
out-of-tree build).

I can make the patch without adding $(OUTPUT). It will require to
fix possible tests which provided only one test and rely on that
behaviour for the OOT build. Do you have an easy way to get a
list of such tests?
