My 5 cents. I was also surprised when I found cpumask_any() nailed to the first
CPU. But for my use I found it beneficial.

Namely, all system IRQs and other events are targeted to the first CPU which is
considered as system maintenance unit. Other CPUs are dedicated to user-specific
payloads using task isolation. This approach improves latency a lot.

Systems that have many cores operating in idling/powersave mode probably benefit
from the state of things as well - they don't wake up sleeping cores and therefore
save power and improve IRQ turnaround.

Thanks,
Yury
