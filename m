Ahh, sorry for my unclear comment.
I think "PLL settings" is very board/platform specific,
so, adding such code to common driver will be issue in the future.
This is the reason why I don't want add it to audio-graph-card.

But, as I mentioned above and Sameer is already doing,
you can reuse audio-graph-card and customize it.

	Reuse audio-graph-card + Use your own PLL code
	= your own customized audio-graph-card

You can reuse audio-graph-card code by calling graph_parse_of(),
and customize before/after that.
I think no duplicate code is needed.

I hope it can help you.

Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
