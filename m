I'm entirely convinced that this area of pstore needs to be cleaned up
and I want to have the pstore backends be able to declare their kmsg
dump reason filters in a configurable fashion. So at least on the pstore
end, I intend to have some way to do this.

Yup. dump_oops will be deprecated in favor of whatever we settle on here.

I'm also fine with this. I can have pstore infrastructure doing the
filtering if kmsg dump doesn't want to. Given the existence of
printk.always_kmsg_dump, though, it seemed like it was better to have
kmsg dump do this filtering instead.

At this point my preference is to switch to a bit field -- I don't see a
reason for ordering. The only cases that remain "special" appear to be
PANIC and EMERG (which, again, aren't ordered adjacent).
