If I correctly understand your question, yes I think so.
If a hight-order free page was allocated on ALLOC_HARDER context, and the p=
age
was the last order-1, then zone->nr_reserved_highatomic will be increased b=
y
pageblock_nr_pages even though there was actually no free page moved to the
highatomic free page list.

The highatomic logic, I think, was originally designed to reserve in
that coarse grained
way to mitigate highatomic allocation failure.

I do not know well, but I think high-order lower than 1/2 of pageblock_nr_p=
ages
also should be considered. i.e) a system using huge order-3 atomic allocati=
on
in a short time.

> "reserved_highatomic:32768KB and actually 14232kB free."

I think this unwanted case might happen by freed pages. The pages allocated
for non-high-atomic also would be freed back into highatomic free
list. But I guess
there was sudden huge use of highatomic and partially freed.
