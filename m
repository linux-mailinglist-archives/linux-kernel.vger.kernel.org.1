Wow, thank you for the near immediate response.  I'm am quite impressed.

It was our understanding that the preference is not to add new misc 
devices.  As I go and try to find a supporting reference for that, I 
cannot find one, so I'm not entirely sure where that idea came from.

In addition, we see that the Habana Labs driver also uses chardev, and 
has chosen the same max.  We assumed that since their driver is already 
accepted, using the same mechanisms where applicable would be the 
preferred approach.

Specific to the max, 256 was chosen as being a factor larger than the 
largest system we have, therefore we figured it wouldn't be hit for a 
long while even as we try to have a look at what might happen down the 
road.  Looking at the Habana code, it looks like they have the same 
value for much of the same reasons, although their usecases may vary 
from ours somewhat.

At this time, I don't think we have a strong requirement for a chardev, 
so we could investigate a switch over to a misc dev if you would prefer 
that over following the Habana Labs precedent.  All I ask is a 
confirmation that is the approach you would like to see going forward 
after reviewing the above.
