The distros were shipping policies for their respective LSMs that
confined some subset of the processes, and userspace was leveraging
those LSMs (both to get/set labels and to get policy decisions for
userspace enforcers) well before Android adopted SELinux.  I think
that counts as usage.  If by usage you mean end users were writing
their own policies, that certainly is a more specialized class of
users but that's even less so in Android, where end users aren't
allowed to modify the policy at all.
