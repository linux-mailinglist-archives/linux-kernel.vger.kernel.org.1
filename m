Well... That makes passing data between Windows and Linux machines
using USB stick "interesting", right?

I know, but bear with me.

No need to pull straw men for me.

This thread suggested that kernel is _not_ supposed to be robust
against corrupt filesystems (because fsck is not integrated in
kernel). Which was news to me (and I'm not the person that needs
warning in execve documentation).

I'd certainly like to hear that VFAT and EXT4 _is_ supposed to be
robust in that way.

And if we have filesystems where corrupt image is known to allow
arbitrary code execution, we need to

a) document that.

b) disable them when secure boot is enabled.

Because with secure boot, we are supposed to be secure against attacks
=66rom root, and root can prepare malicious filesystems. ("The problem,
simply put, is this: the objective of secure boot is to prevent the
system from running any unsigned code in a privileged mode. So, if one
boots a Linux system that, in turn, gives access to the machine to
untrusted code, the entire purpose has been defeated. The consequences
could hurt both locally (bad code could take control of the machine)
and globally (the signing key used to boot Linux could be revoked), so
it is an outcome that is worth avoiding. Doing so, however, requires
placing limitations in the kernel so that not even root can circumvent
the secure boot chain of trust." -- https://lwn.net/Articles/514985/
