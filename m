To clarify something further: I'm genuinely not looking to push hard on
the limits or corners of the kernel/userspace boundary here, nor do I
want to create an imposition on development. I'm happy to attempt to be
a little more flexible than most userspace. I'm trying to make
substantial, non-trivial use of the userspace side of a kernel/userspace
boundary, and within reason, I need to rely on the kernel's stability
guarantees. I'm relying on the combination of
Documentation/filesystems/ext4 and fs/ext4 as the format documentation.
The first time I discovered this issue was in doing some "there's about
to be a new kernel release" regression testing for 5.9, in which it
created a debugging adventure to track down what the problem was. I'd
like to find a good way to report and handle this kind of thing going
forward, if another issue like this arises.
