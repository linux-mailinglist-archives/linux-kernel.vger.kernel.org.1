I'm surely not proud of it and neither is anyone else involved in that.

Sorry, I was not aware of that.

We tried hard to keep all that separate, but at some point the resulting
conflicts became interesting.

 1) There was interest to keep the KCSAN history intact because Paul had
    stuff depending on it already

 2) Will's changes conflicted heavily and we had to make a decision what
    has to based on what

 3) Peter's an my efforts to get the whole entry maze sorted out
    introduced another massive change in the same area.

After discussing things back and forth we came to the conclusion that
KCSAN is ready to go and we base all that other stuff on top. In
hindsight maybe not the most brightest idea.

They got shipped independently because they were legit bugs and the
fixes independent of KCSAN.

TBH, yes. We played a reasonable amount of patch testris to avoid this
kind of interdependenies already and yes I have to admit that at some
point I gave up with the KCSAN/Will/Peterz conflicts.

I spent quite some time over the past weekend to rebase everything which
still depends on that (tip: x86/entry and ras/core ] onto a Will ->
Peterz scheme and make KCSAN a separate entity, but I'm still facing a
few subtle bugs which I have not decoded yet.

That said, I would appreciate if you bite the bullet and take the mess
as is, but I'm perfectly willing to bite the bullet and get all of this
restructured in the hope to get it done in time.

What really would cause massive frustration would be to sacrifice the
entry rework for this.

Anyway, I hope I gave you enough context and as I'm not going to touch
any of this before tomorrow morning, please take your time and let me
know.

Thanks,

        Thomas
