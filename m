Actually, for more serious problem consider arch/x86/lib/copy_user_64.S

In case of an unhandled fault on attempt to read an (unaligned) word,
the damn thing falls back to this:
SYM_CODE_START_LOCAL(.Lcopy_user_handle_tail)
        movl %edx,%ecx
1:      rep movsb
2:      mov %ecx,%eax
        ASM_CLAC 
        ret

        _ASM_EXTABLE_UA(1b, 2b)
SYM_CODE_END(.Lcopy_user_handle_tail)

We could do what alpha, sparc et.al. are doing - have both reads and
writes aligned, with every output word being a mix of two input ones.
But I would expect that to be considerably slower than the current
variants.  Sure, we can set AC in .Lcopy_user_handle_tail, but that
doesn't look right.

And while squeezing every byte on a short copy is not a hard requirement,
in situation when the source is one byte before the end of page and
destination is aligned, raw_copy_from_user() really must copy at least
one byte if it's readable.

So I suspect that we need a variant of extable entry that does not
clear AC, at least for these fallbacks.

PS: I'm still going through the _ASM_EXTABLE... users on x86, so there
might be more fun.  Will post when I'm done...
