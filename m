I think it does. I would rather my patch which doesn't add a barrier to=20
the "fast" path though (by the time we get here I think the fast path is
that we are sleeping on the page, doing the IO).

Alternatively (although this still adds more branching than necessary at
least it doesn't have a barrier for the sleeping case), you could set
the running state as an else case if you don't schedule.

Thanks,
Nick
