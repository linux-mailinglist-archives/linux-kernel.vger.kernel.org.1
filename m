Then, this reasoning will be also applicable to

  [PATCH] printk: Add loglevel for "do not print to consoles".

in a sense that "don't try to quickly queue a lot of messages" rule. This concern
cannot be solved even if asynchronous printk() and per console loglevel are
supported someday, and oom_dump_tasks() is not allowed to count on these for
solving the stall problem caused by reporting all OOM victim candidates at once.

We could assign per task_struct buffers and per CPU interrupt context buffers
(like we discussed about how to handle KERN_CONT problem). But managing these
off stack buffers is out of scope for this patch.

OK. I think that redirecting pr_debug() to vsnprintf(NULL, 0) will be
better than modifying dynamic_debug path, for

since "enabling all entries by default" will redirect pr_debug() calls to
printk(KERN_DEBUG), the "don't try to quickly queue too much messages" above
remains (i.e. it is essentially same with what this patch is doing).
