Okay, got it.  So, correct me if this is wrong, the information that is
needed to boot the enclave is:

* the kernel, in bzImage format

* the initrd

* a consecutive amount of memory, to be mapped with
KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION

Off list, Alex and I discussed having a struct that points to kernel and
initrd off enclave memory, and have the driver build EIF at the
appropriate point in enclave memory (the 8 MiB ofset that you mentioned).

This however has two disadvantages:

1) having the kernel and initrd loaded by the parent VM in enclave
memory has the advantage that you save memory outside the enclave memory
for something that is only needed inside the enclave

2) it is less extensible (what if you want to use PVH in the future for
example) and puts in the driver policy that should be in userspace.


So why not just start running the enclave at 0xfffffff0 in real mode?
Yes everybody hates it, but that's what OSes are written against.  In
the simplest example, the parent enclave can load bzImage and initrd at
0x10000 and place firmware tables (MPTable and DMI) somewhere at
0xf0000; the firmware would just be a few movs to segment registers
followed by a long jmp.

If you want to keep EIF, we measured in QEMU that there is no measurable
difference between loading the kernel in the host and doing it in the
guest, so Amazon could provide an EIF loader stub at 0xfffffff0 for
backwards compatibility.

That's great to hear!
