This link is not guaranteed to be stable and the commit should have the
full description rather than referring to another email.

It also needs Fixes: and Cc: stable tags.

I can see how this could happen but it would be useful to provide a
concrete example in the commit log.

The instruction opcode built by call_undef_hook() first reads a u16 as a
T16 instruction and the above should be fine. However, if this looks
like a T32 opcode, it reads a subsequent u16 which becomes the lowest
half-word and the above mask/val may inadvertently match it.

The patch looks fine to me as long as you update the commit log.

Thanks.
