Nothing fundamental, it's just that we don't have a large code model in the C
compiler.  As a result all the global symbols are resolved as 32-bit
PC-relative accesses.  We could fix this with a fast large code model, but then
the kernel would need to relax global symbol references in modules and we don't
even do that for the simple code models we have now.  FWIW, some of the
proposed large code models are essentially just split-PLT/GOT and therefor
don't require relaxation, but at that point we're essentially PIC until we
have more that 2GiB of kernel text -- and even then, we keep all the
performance issues.

Essentially what's above, the modules smell the same as the rest of the
kernel's code and therefor have a similar set of restrictions.  If we build PIC
modules and have the PLT entries do GOT loads (as do our shared libraries) then
we could break this restriction, but that comes with some performance
implications.  Like I said in the other email, I'm less worried about the
instruction side of things so maybe that's the right way to go.

Our PIC codegen, probably better addressed by my other email and above.
