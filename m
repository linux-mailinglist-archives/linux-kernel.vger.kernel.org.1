__get_user_pages is documented as
 * -- If nr_pages is 0, returns 0.
 * -- If nr_pages is >0, but no pages were pinned, returns -errno.
 * -- If nr_pages is >0, and some pages were pinned, returns the number of
 *    pages pinned. Again, this may be less than nr_pages.

but let me double check the actual code... There seem to be only one
exception the above rule AFAICS. faultin_page returning EBUSY will
be overriden to either 0 for the first page or return the number of
already pinned pages. So nr_pages > 0 && ret = 0 is indeed possible
from __get_user_pages :/ That will be the case only for VM_FAULT_RETRY,
thoug.

Now __get_user_pages_locked behaves differently. It keeps retrying the
fault until it succeeds unless FOLL_NOWAIT is specified. Then it would
return 0. Why we need to return 0 is not really clear to me but it
seem to be a long term behavior. I believe we need to document it.

> And if it is, then the current code is harmless.

Yes from the above it seems that the check is indeed harmless becasue
this path doesn't use FOLL_NOWAIT and so it will never see 0 return.
I find a reference to EINTR confusing so I would still love to change
that.

Would you mind this patch instead?

    mm, mempolicy: fix up gup usage in lookup_node
    
    ba841078cd05 ("mm/mempolicy: Allow lookup_node() to handle fatal signal") has
    added a special casing for 0 return value because that was a possible
    gup return value when interrupted by fatal signal. This has been fixed
    by ae46d2aa6a7f ("mm/gup: Let __get_user_pages_locked() return -EINTR
    for fatal signal") in the mean time so ba841078cd05 can be reverted.
    
    This patch however doesn't go all the way to revert it because the check
    for 0 is wrong and confusing here. Firstly it is inherently unsafe to
    access the page when get_user_pages_locked returns 0 (aka no page
    returned).
    Fortunatelly this will not happen because get_user_pages_locked will not
    return 0 when nr_pages > 0 unless FOLL_NOWAIT is specified which is not
    the case here. Document this potential error code in gup code while we
    are at it.
