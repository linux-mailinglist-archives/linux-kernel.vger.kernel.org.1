It is the NIOS2 soft processor mostly used in the FPGA. I see the there
is an arch/nios2 folder in kernel.

On Intel PAC N3000 card, the embedded NIOS2 core in FPGA does some
Board initialization work (Mostly the configuration of ethernet retimer)
on reboot. And the dfl-n3000-nios private feature in DFL is actually the
handshake interfaces for host to communicate with the NIOS2 core, about 
what parameters to use, when the configuration is finished ...

Thanks,
