Yes, the MMU page-size is better here.

I still have some questions regarding MMUPageSize VS. KerelPageSize.
Could you please clarify?

I checked the show_smap code in fs/proc/task_mmu.c. We defined a __weak 
function for vma_mmu_pagesize(), which invokes vma_kernel_pagesize(). 
The comments also say that "In the majority of cases, the page size used 
by the kernel matches the MMU size. On architectures where it differs, 
an architecture-specific 'strong' version of this symbol is required."
I searched the vma_mmu_pagesize(). It seems that PowerPC is the only one 
that defines a 'strong' function. In other words, the MMUPageSize and 
KerelPageSize are the same for X86. However, it seems not true for the 
above compound page cases. Is it a bug for smaps? Or am I missed anything?

Thanks,
Kan
