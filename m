I have talked quite a bit about Fair Pay here, that we need for correct 
streaming and OS developlment.

I think a new branch of OpenMandriva would be good. "Star-X".

Philosophically the problem is Tao that is a Fire Lizard, and 
Theoprastus, that seems to be about the same, and nonsensical church 
teachings, that hinder development.

They both seem based on Sinc, something that many programmers know.

They way we can solve this is making Uni more about relevant Business 
and Psychology.

Education here does not support Tao/Theoprastus.

Indeed they are about viking partycustoms, something I know from my own 
time in Business School.

I have also made a youtube channel on this: Uni Suf - 
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCorCUBYDCbTDcPtglKwfwpw (on popular 
demand).

Suf (woolrobe) philosophists like the Sinc aswell!

Watch if you like Whiskey Odes.

Serenity!
