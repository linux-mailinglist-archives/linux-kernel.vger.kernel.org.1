I haven't seen where anyone has suggested that such junk hardware
exists. Do you know of or expect any firmware that has mismatched
TCG_PCR_EVENT2.digests.count and TCG_EfiSpecIdEvent.numberOfAlgorithms
values?

I would think that the userspace code that's parsing
/sys/kernel/security/tpm0/binary_bios_measurements would also have
issues with such an event log.

Small but important correction: it is a zero-hashes case, not a
zero-supported-hashes case

There's no handshake involved or anything like that. This would only
cause problems if the firmware provided no hashes, which means the
firmware event log is unusable, anyways.
