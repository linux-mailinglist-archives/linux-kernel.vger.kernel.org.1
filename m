Regs width difference between BDW and BYT comes from specification. BDW 
has IPC registers which are 32 wide. This fact ain't exactly the reason 
to modify sst_shim32_read64.

I'm sharing Amadeo's point of view. Your change should slow down 
execution a bit - but that might be just what handlers needed to make 
everything work again. Debug prints also slow down the execution what 
could have prevented you from spotting the real problem.
Let's ignore the memcpy stuff for a moment - could you focus on 
elaborating the scenario where such issue occurs? Your initial commit 
message also skips important bits such as platform used when reproducing 
and so on, please add them.

Thanks,
Czarek
