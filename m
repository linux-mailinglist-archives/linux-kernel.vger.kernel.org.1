For us, this part of modification have reached a consensus.

Nonono, I don't want to set bt_bmc->irq to rc, I think they are irrelevant.

The logic of the previous code will continue to execute even if 
platform_get_irq() failed,which will be brought devm_request_irq() 
failed too. "bt_bmc->irq = 0" here is just for bt_bmc_remove() to 
execute del_timer_sync(). Otherwise the function del_timer_sync() will 
not execute if not set "bt_bmc->irq" to zero, because it's negative 
actually.

But now, the logic is: if the platform_get_irq_optional() failed, it 
returns immediately, the irq at this point is negative,the 
bt_bmc_probe() continue to operate. But in the function bt_bmc_remove(), 
we need status check in order to execute del_timer_sync(), so change 
"!bt_bmc->irq" to "bt_bmc->irq < 0".

So, when the judgment of "bt_bmc->irq" in the function bt_bmc_remove() 
goes back to  the original negative value, the "bt_bmc->irq = 0" in the 
line 410 become redundant. That's why I remove it.



I am very glad to communicate and discuss with you these days.

Thanks,

Tang Bin
