Qian,

can you please ensure that people who got cc'ed because the problem
affects their subsystem are included on your replies even if you are
replying to a different subthread?

I explicitely did:

     Cc:+ Alexander

at the very beginning of my reply:

   https://lore.kernel.org/r/87v9k3jdc6.fsf@nanos.tec.linutronix.de

to make you aware of that.

Yes, email sucks, but it sucks even more when people are careless.

This loop has absolutely nothing to do with stack entry usage. 

foo()
  do {
     bar();
  } while (condition);
}

If you take a stack trace inside bar() it will be the same stack trace
for every single loop iteration. And that stack trace will not be any
different from:

foo()
{
  bar():
}

assumed that the call chain leading to foo() is the same in both cases.

And you can add even more loops in subsequent call chains within
bar(). They do not matter at all.

And this one is completely irrelevant because the interrupt which we are
looking at is a PCI interrupt which CANNOT be shared. IOW, the number of
loop iterations and the number of handlers invoked is exactly ONE.

I seriously have no idea what you are trying to demonstrate by finding
loops in a SINGLE callchain.

That stack trace for each invocation of free_fn() in this loop is
exactly the same stack trace. The same stack trace is not eating up any
memory because the hash matches, i.e. the stack trace in the depot is
already known.

Here is the simplified difference between the old code and the new code:

  Old                             New

  handle_edge_irq                 handle_edge_irq
  do_IRQ	                  asm_call_on_stack
  common_interrupt                common_interrupt
                                  asm_common_interrupt

IOW, for every _UNIQUE_ interrupt related call chain, there is exactly
ONE stack entry more than before.

For a loop which generates the exact same stack trace for every
iteration this extra entry is not a problem.

But what matters is that interrupts can hit any random code path. So the
amount of possible non-unique call chains is pretty much unlimited. And
with a high number of non-unique call chains the extra entry starts to
matter.

It's trival math, isn't it?

TS  = Total Size of depot
as  = average size of all stored unique stack traces
ms  = maximum number of unqiue stack traces which fit in TS

    ms_old = TS / as

Lets further assume that the vast majority of stack traces are taken
from interrupt context. That means with the new code this results in:

    ms_new = TS / (as + 1)

==> ms_new = ms_old * as / (as + 1)

Depending on the value of 'as' the +1 can shave off a significant
percentage of capacity. IOW, the capacity is simply too small now for
the test scenario you are running. Truly a surprising outcome, right?

To get facts instead of useless loop theories, can you please apply the
patch below, enable DEBUGFS and provide the output of

       /sys/kernel/debug/stackdepot/info

for a kernel before that change and after? Please read out that file at
periodically roughly the same amounts of time after starting your test
scenario.

Note, that I doubled the size of the stack depot so that we get real
numbers and not the cutoff by the size limit. IOW, the warning should
not trigger anymore. If it triggers nevertheless then the numbers will
still tell us an interesting story.

Thanks,
