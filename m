Yes, we should certainly not have any SBI call for reading the PMU counter.
The S-mode software should always have direct access to the actual counter
value (i.e. CSR for HW counters and memory location for SBI specific counters).

The SBI calls that we have been discussing here only deal with describing
counters and configuring it.

I agree with 1) and 2) limitations mentioned above. We certainly need a
RISC-V PMU extension in RISC-V privilege spec. Maybe you can propose
creating a working-group for this ??

My worry is that defining RISC-V PMU extension will take time and meanwhile
more HW will show-up this year and next year which will have the same set of
basic HPMCOUNTER CSRs. We are trying to brainstorm the best thing we can
do when we have just HPMCOUNTER CSRs accessible to S-mode. The SBI
PMU extension discussed here only tries to complement existing HPMCOUNTER
CSRs so that SOC designers can at least provide implementation specific CSRs
for configuring HW counters. The SBI PMU extension won't be able to solve the
counter overflow detection so we will have to depend on software techniques to
detect overflow.

I agree. This guide should be either updated or removed.
