A PLT slot is allocated for each b or bl instruction that refers to a
symbol that lives in a different section, either of the same module
(e.g., bl in .init calling into .text), of another module, or of the
core kernel.

I don't see how you end up with plt_max_entries in this case, though.
Are you sure you have CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE enabled?

Yes please.
