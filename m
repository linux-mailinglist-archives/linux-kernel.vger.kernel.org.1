It's been a month so I think it's a good idea to go forward
applying IMX and STM patches (probably with the usual
rebase dance).

As for Rockchip...

... I'll be getting some DSI hardware to help with the pending
Rockchip issues, so we can tackle Rockchip as well. I'm quite sure
we'll loop Heiko as well if needed :-)
