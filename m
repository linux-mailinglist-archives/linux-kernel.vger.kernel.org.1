Correct.

I think it would be reasonable to add new, less erratic PTRACE_SETxyz
modes, but the old ones will stay as is.

Strictly speaking, the issue you had wasn't a ptrace change.  It was a
context switching change.  Before the change, you were programming
garbage into the tracee state, but the context switch code wasn't
capable of restoring the garbage correctly and instead happened to
restore the state you actually wanted.  With the new code, the context
switch actually worked correctly (for some value of correctly), and
the tracee crashed.  Not that this distinction really matters.
