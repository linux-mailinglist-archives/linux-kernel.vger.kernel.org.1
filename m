Hi Jarkko,

patch 1 is indeed wrong (I oversaw the action call in case of error),
so please ignore it.

However patches 2 and 3 are based on bugs I encountered while working with
TPM. I am sorry if I did not make the issues clear enough in the patches
commit messages. Let me try to explain it in more detail:

The bugs showed up after unloading the TPM chip driver module while one
process still had the /dev/tpmrm device open.

It is easy to reproduce:

1. open /dev/tpmrm* and keep it open
2. remove the tpm chip driver (in my case this was tpm_tis_spi)
3. try to write() to the still opened device /dev/tpmrm*


This results in warnings like the following:

After some investigation I found out that the two warnings concerning a re=
fcount
underflow pop up due to an invalid chip->dev. Writing to
/dev/tpmrm* eventually calls tpm_common_write() which makes use of tpm_try=
_get_ops().
The latter function tries to get a ref for chip->dev which at this time al=
ready has
hit 0.

As it turned out, the reference we lack here is exactly the one that is su=
pposed to
be taken in tpm_chip_alloc():

if (chip->flags & TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2)
	get_device(&chip->dev);

If you take a look at these lines and the code above you will figure that =
there
is no program path in which TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 could ever be set at this t=
ime.
So the reference is never taken, even if we are using TPM2 with /dev/tpmrm=
*.

I tried to follow the history of this bug and it seems to start with commi=
t
fdc915f7f719 which introduced the support for /dev/tpmrm.
This commit seemed to have already in mind that /dev/tpmrm could still be =
opened
after the tpm chip driver has been unregistered.
For this reason an extra reference to chip->dev was taken.
See this excerpt of commit fdc915f7f719:

<SNIP>
+       chip->devs.release =3D tpm_devs_release;
+       /* get extra reference on main device to hold on
+        * behalf of devs.  This holds the chip structure
+        * while cdevs is in use.  The corresponding put
+        * is in the tpm_devs_release
+        */
<SNAP>

This reference was supposed to be freed in tpm_devs_release() as the comme=
nt says:

<SNIP>
+static void tpm_devs_release(struct device *dev)
+{
+       struct tpm_chip *chip =3D container_of(dev, struct tpm_chip, devs)=
;
+
+       /* release the master device reference */
+       put_device(&chip->dev);
+}
<SNAP>

However the code did not work as expected at this time, because the refere=
nce
to chip->devs that we get with device_initalize() is never release.
This prevents tpm_devs_release() from being called which as a consequnce m=
isses
the put on chip->dev we do there.

This led to behaviour which commit 8979b02aaf1d tried to fix.
See the message of this commit:

" The main device is currently not properly released due to one additional
    reference to the 'devs' device which is only released in case of a TPM=
 2.
    So, also get the additional reference only in case of a TPM2."

Actually the additional reference was _never_ released even not in TPM2 ca=
se
(as described above).
The right fix at this point would IMHO have been to make sure that chip->d=
evs
reference is put one more time to make sure that tpm_devs_release() is cal=
led
and also chip->dev is put one more time.

Instead 8979b02aaf1d chose another approach:

+       if (chip->flags & TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2)
+               get_device(&chip->dev);

was introduced to avoid getting the reference in the first place for the n=
on-TPM2 case.
This fixed the non-TPM2 case but now left the TPM2 case without an additio=
nal reference,
too (since as stated above there is nothing that sets the needed flag to g=
rap the ref
for TPM2).

So while before we had taken the ref in both cases TPM2 and non-TPM2 and n=
ever released
it in either case (which was wrong), we now do not take it in neither case=
 (which is
also wrong).

And this is what we have today. If we open /dev/tpmrm* and then unregister=
 the chip
all references to chip->dev are already gone. An attempt to write() to /de=
v/tpmrm* then
results in the reference underflow warning, because we try to grab a ref t=
o chip->dev in
tpm_try_get_ops() while the chip-dev refcount already has hit 0.


So what patch 2 is supposed to do is 1st. revert 8979b02aaf1d:

-       if (chip->flags & TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2)
-               get_device(&chip->dev);
+       get_device(&chip->dev);

to get the extra ref to chip->dev unconditionally as originally proposed b=
y commit
fdc915f7f7193.

And 2nd. fix the actual issue of fdc915f7f7193 namely a missing put of chi=
p->devs to
eventually release the extra reference to the main device (aka. chip->dev)=
.

+       rc =3D devm_add_action_or_reset(pdev,
+                                     (void (*)(void *)) put_device,
+                                     &chip->devs);

I hope this makes patch 2 a bit clearer. Beside an older kernel I tested i=
t
with the mainline kernel and the patch fixes the above issues. However any=
one
is welcome to test it themselfes.
If you are fine with this solution I am going to prepare a v2 which fixes =
the
action handler part. Otherwise please let me know what your concerns are a=
nd
I will try to address it.



Now concerning patch 3: If after steps 1 - 3 above you do

4. close /dev/tpmrm*

you will run into the next issue, which is unrelated to the reference coun=
t bug, namely
a NULL pointer dereference:

AFAIU this is since at the time the file is closed and the files release()=
 function
is called the chips ops pointer is already NULL. It has been set to NULL a=
t the time
when the chip was unregistered (see tpm_del_char_device()).

The fix here is to first check if the ops pointer is still valid. That sho=
uld be true
as long as the chip has not been unregistered. If the chip has been unregi=
stered
already the ops pointer wont be accessable any more. In this case skip flu=
shing the
sessions.

However please ignore this patch for now, too, since while it works with a=
n older
kernel (4.19 is the one I am working with) it turned out not to be the cor=
rect
solution for the mainline kernel. I would have to take a closer look for t=
he
mainline case and then send a patch as soon as I have one.

Regards,
Lino
