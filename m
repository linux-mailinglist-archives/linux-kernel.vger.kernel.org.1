Fair enough. But don't "voltage corner" based devices NEED to use OPP
framework to set their frequencies?

Because, if voltage corners are only handled through OPP framework,
then any device that uses voltage corners doesn't get to pick and
choose when to vote for what path. Also, maybe a one liner helper
function to enable BW voting using OPP framework by default might be
another option. Something like:
dev_pm_opp_enable_bw_voting(struct device *dev)?

If devices with voltage corners can still do their own
frequency/voltage corner control without having to use OPP framework,
then I agree with your point above.
