As a conclusion on research, I been working with organizing information 
and media from the last 30 years, since an OS ultimately deals with pop 
aspects, and I have been a producer myself (to promote good OS 
engineering aswell ("trance" was this)).

And I have suggested a move to Islamic background for Fair Pay.

Actually a muslim remix of the graphics scene fits perfectly. As "Mesa" 
(also in Black Mesa) reflects the mesosphere, "Nur" (arabic) is a 
correct version of this.

Serene Greetings,
