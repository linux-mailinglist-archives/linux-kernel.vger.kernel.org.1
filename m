Only relevant on SGX2 hardware, see discussion below.

I don't believe that enclaves should be plural in this context.

The 'me' should be 'be' in the above line.

Just some further clarifications that should, arguably, be included in
the kernel documentation given their security implications.

The 900 pound primate in the room, that no one is acknowledging, is
that this technology was designed to not allow the operating system to
have any control over what it is doing.  In the mindset of kernel
developers, the operating system is the absolute authority on
security, so we find ourselves in a situation where the kernel needs
to try and work around this fact so any solutions will be imperfect at
best.

As I've noted before, this is actually a primary objective of enclave
authors, since one of the desires for 'Confidential Computing' is to
hide things like proprietary algorithms from the platform owners.  I
think the driver needs to acknowledge this fact and equip platform
owners with the simplest and most effective security solutions that
are available.

The only reason that mprotect protections are needed in this driver
are to close a security loophole on SGX2 hardware, ie. hardware that
supports the ENCLU[EMODPE] instruction.  This instruction allows an
enclave to modify page permissions that are encoded in the Enclave
Page Cache Metadata (EPCM) at initialization time.  In all likelihood,
this is going to be the only relevant hardware that this driver runs
on.

On SGX2 hardware, enclave based code can conspire with its untrusted
runtime to allow executable regions to have write permissions.  This
would allow the enclave to load and execute whatever code that it
pleases and that the operating system would have no visibility into
whatsoever.

The non-SGX2 platforms don't need mprotect protections since even if
they were to modify at the OS level their page permissions, any
attempts to access a page with modified permissions would be trapped
by the EPCM protections that are unmodifiable after the enclave has
been initialized.

In light of this, given the decision by the driver authors to not
fully equip the driver with EDMM support, the mprotect protection
requirements are straight forward and minimalistic.  All that is
needed is a binary valued variable, set on the command-line, that
either allows or denies anonymous code execution by an enclave,
ie. access to page protection changes after initialization.

The enclave page mapping callback is elegant but has little use if the
objective of all this is to allow the driver to enforce SGX1 semantics
on a platform that has SGX2 instruction support.  Save the elegant
solution until a reasoned arguement can be made as to what anyone
would actually be able to do with the per page permissions checks,
even on an EDMM capable driver.

I could go into detail on that issue as well but I hesitate to be an
insufferable bore.

I hope all of this is helpful.

Have a good weekend.
