I've wondered about the mm-commits messages too, and concluded that the most probable explanation is that Andrew tried to add your series to mmotm and then tried mmotm merge to linux-next and found out the series is already there via your rcu tree :)

OK, I will check the other code.

Yeah, that should do the trick to prevent accessing garbage dbg_userword.

But I wrote the comments about SLAB first and only in the SLUB part I realized
about the larger picture. So now I would consider something like below, which
should find the closest valid object index and resulting pointer offset in
kmem_dump_obj() might become negative. Pointers to padding, below page->s_mem or
beyond last object just become respectively large negative or positive pointer
offsets and we probably don't need to warn for them specially unless we warn
also for all other pointers that are not within the "data area" of the object.

void kmem_obj_info(struct kmem_obj_info *kpp, void *object, struct page *page)
{
        struct kmem_cache *cachep;
        unsigned int objnr;
        void *objp;

        kpp->kp_ptr = object;
        kpp->kp_page = page;
        cachep = page->slab_cache;
        kpp->kp_slab_cache = cachep;
        kpp->kp_data_offset = obj_offset(cachep);
	if (object < page->s_mem)
		objnr = 0;
	else
        	objnr = obj_to_index(cachep, page, object);
	if (objnr >= cachep->num)
		objnr = cachep->num - 1;
        objp = index_to_obj(cachep, page, objnr);
        kpp->kp_objp = objp;
        if (DEBUG && cachep->flags & SLAB_STORE_USER)
                kpp->kp_ret = *dbg_userword(cachep, objp);
}

I don't think it could be possible, could you describe the conditions?

> Or am I missing something subtle here?

A version analogical to the SLAB one above could AFAICS look like this:

...
        kpp->kp_ptr = object;
        kpp->kp_page = page;
        kpp->kp_slab_cache = s;
        base = page_address(page);
        objp0 = kasan_reset_tag(object);
#ifdef CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG
        objp = restore_red_left(s, objp0);
#else
        objp = objp0;
#endif
        kpp->kp_data_offset = (unsigned long)((char *)objp0 - (char *)objp);
        objnr = obj_to_index(s, page, objp0); // unlike SLAB this can't underflow
	if (objnr >= page->objects)
		objnr = page->objects - 1;
        objp = base + s->size * objnr;
        kpp->kp_objp = objp;
	// no WARN_ON_ONCE() needed, objp has to be valid, we just might have negative
	// offset to it, or a larger than s->size positive offset
#ifdef CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG
	// etc, no changes below
