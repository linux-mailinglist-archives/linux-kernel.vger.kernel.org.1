Thank you for reviewing it!

Yeah, I agree that using monospaced fonts on this case too would
be nice. The C domain actually uses italic monospaced fonts for
broken XREFs.

I suspect that changing this at automarkup.py would be simple, but
not sure if it would be safe.

Jon can tell more about that, as he's the author of automarkup,
but I suspect that the reason for the current behavior is to avoid 
false-positives. 

I mean, if "struct foo" symbol doesn't exist at the C domain, this
might mean that the parser is doing something wrong. So, a more
conservative approach is to keep the string as-is.

On the other hand, if one finds a valid "struct foo" using normal
fonts, this would mean that either the doc is outdated, mentioning
an struct that were removed/renamed or that there's a missing 
kernel-doc markup.

In any case, the fix is to simply fix the kernel-doc markup for
struct foo.

I guess in the future automarkup.py could issue a warning in
order to warn about missing cross-references, perhaps when
W=1 or W=2 is used.

Thanks,
Mauro
