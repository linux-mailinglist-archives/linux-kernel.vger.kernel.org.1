Hi Suman,

AFAIK, most (if not all) the drivers are using ioremap to expose the
remoteproc memories. Since these are IO memories, then care should be
taken when writing/reading from them and memset_io/memcpy_fromio
/memcpy_toio should be used (or ioread/write). Currently, this is not
the case in the remoteproc driver and it works because everything is
aligned and there is no misaligned access. IMHO, as suggested by Peng,
remoteproc core should use such accessors.

We (at Kalray) have some modifications to do that since
there were some misalignment after modifying the resource table (64 bits
fields).

The only drawback that I can see using io memcpy is potentially a loss
of performance for processors not requiring any alignement check. But
other than that, it seems safer for everyon and performance in init does
not seems really critical.

This does not only apply to firmware loading. This applies to all the
resource table accesses which are currently done using direct accesses
to members. They should also used io memcpy.
