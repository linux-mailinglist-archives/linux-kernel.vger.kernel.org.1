Sorry for the confusion and the above note might have scared people.
Also I misunderstood some internal discussions we had as part of my
SMCCC SOC_ID series[1]. I realised(rather Mark made me realise) this
SCMI SMC is kind of dependent on PSCI as we reuse the conduit from there.
So for now I will make it depend on PSCI to fix the build temporarily.

Also I will try to work out if we can move HAVE_ARCH_SMCCC to something
like HAVE_ARCH_RAW_SMCCC and use HAVE_ARCH_SMCCC for newer changes that
depend on PSCI for probing and conduit. The legacy SMCCC can then go under
HAVE_ARCH_RAW_SMCCC. This was Mark's suggestion, I will try to work it
out and may be post it as part of my SMCCC SOC_ID series also moving
code under drivers/firmware/smccc
