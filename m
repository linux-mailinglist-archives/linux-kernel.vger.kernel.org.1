Or should not have been submitted.

KASAN is documented.  The difficulty is that this race is obviously 
hard to trigger, and without the ability to reproduce it we can't run 
diagnostics to find the underlying cause.

We can't even ask syzbot to try running tests for us; without a valid 
reproducer it won't agree to rerun the original test program.
