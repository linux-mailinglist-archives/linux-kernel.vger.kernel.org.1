I think this is probably fine to change now. I'd always wanted to
"upgrade" the default to KILL_PROCESS, but wanted to wait for
KILL_PROCESS to exist at all for a while first. :)

I'm not aware of any filter generators (e.g. libseccomp, Chrome) that
depend on unknown filter return values to cause a KILL_THREAD, and
everything I've seen indicates that they aren't _accidentally_ depending
on it either (i.e. they both produce "valid" filters). It's possible
that something out there doesn't, and in that case, we likely need to
make a special case for whatever bad filter value it chose, but we can
cross that bridge when we come to it.

I've added Kyle and Robert to CC as well, as they have noticed subtle
changes to seccomp behavior in the past. I *think* this change should be
fine, but perhaps they will see something I don't. :)

I need to think a little more, but I suspect we should change the coredump
logic (above the quoted code) too... (i.e. "action == SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS"
-> "action != SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD")
