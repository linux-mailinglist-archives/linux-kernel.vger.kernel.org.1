It violates how the shash API is meant to be used in general, but there is a
test that enforces that the shash_desc_ctx for crc32c must be just the single
u32 crc value.  See alg_test_crc32c() in crypto/testmgr.c.  So it's apparently
intended to work.

Ard Biesheuvel recently sent a patch to reduce the alignment of struct
shash_desc to ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN
(https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20210107124128.19791-1-ardb@kernel.org/),
since apparently most of the bloat is from alignment for DMA, which isn't
necessary.  I think that reduces the size by a lot on arm64.

Are you referring to the '2 * sizeof(struct shash_desc)' rather than just
'sizeof(struct shash_desc)'?  As mentioned in the comment above
HASH_MAX_DESCSIZE, there can be a nested shash_desc due to HMAC.
So I believe the value is correct.

As I mentioned in my other response, crc32c_le() isn't a proper library API
(like some of the newer lib/crypto/ stuff) but rather just a wrapper for the
shash API, and it doesn't handle modules being dynamically loaded/unloaded.
So switching to it may cause a performance regression.

What I'd recommend is making crc32c_le() able to call architecture-speccific
implementations directly, similar to blake2s() and chacha20() in lib/crypto/.
Then there would be no concern about when modules get loaded, etc...
