The SetPageLRU is done under lru_lock, but the store to page->mapping
is not, so what ensures ordering between them? And what prevents the
compiler from tearing the store to page->mapping?

The writer does this:

	CPU 0
	page_add_new_anon_rmap()
	  page->mapping = anon_vma + PAGE_MAPPING_ANON
	lru_cache_add_inactive_or_unevictable()
	  spin_lock(lruvec->lock)
	  SetPageLRU()
	  spin_unlock(lruvec->lock)

The concern is what CPU 1 will observe at page->mapping after
observing PageLRU set on the page.

1. anon_vma + PAGE_MAPPING_ANON

   That's the in-order scenario and is fine.

2. NULL

   That's possible if the page->mapping store gets reordered to occur
   after SetPageLRU. That's fine too because we check for it.

3. anon_vma without the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON bit

   That would be a problem and could lead to all kinds of undesirable
   behavior including crashes and data corruption.

   Is it possible? AFAICT the compiler is allowed to tear the store to
   page->mapping and I don't see anything that would prevent it.

That said, I also don't see how the reader testing PageLRU under the
lru_lock would prevent that in the first place. AFAICT we need that
WRITE_ONCE() around the page->mapping assignment that's referenced in
the changelog of this patch but I cannot find in any tree or patch.
