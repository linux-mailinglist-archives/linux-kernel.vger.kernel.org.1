From your description, it appears that you are using cluster readahead
instead of vma readahead.  Can you verify this via,

# cat /sys/kernel/mm/swap/vma_ra_enabled

And if it returns false, you can enable it via,

# echo 1 > /sys/kernel/mm/swap/vma_ra_enabled

Because now swapoff code swapin pages in the page table order instead of
the swap entry order.  But this will turn the sequential disk read to
random disk read too.  Let's see the performance results.

And please make sure that in unuse_pte_range(), after
lookup_swap_cache() returns non-NULL page, it's unnecessary to call
swapin_readahead().
