Yep, they're a distraction and serve absolutely no purpose. They're also
utterly moronic, of course it's code and of course it's bloody well C.

I don't mind the re-indent.

Of course it is, if kerneldoc complains that a perfectly good comment
is no good, then the fault lies with kerneldoc.

It's like checkpatch; assume it is wrong :-)

I've nothing against improving comments, I'm just saying that RST is
absolute atrocious shite and has nothing to do with good comments.

If sphinx doesn't like "NOTE:' when go teach it.

I've never claimed that. My claim is that RST is shite and has no added
value.
