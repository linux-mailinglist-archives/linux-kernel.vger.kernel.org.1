Hello Julien,

Could we elaborate on this point, please? 'Stack validation' means
getting an accurate picture of all kernel code that will be executed
at some point in the future, due to the fact that there are stack
frames pointing to them. And this ability is essential in order to do
live patching safely?

If this is the goal, I wonder whether this is the right approach for
arm64 (or for any other architecture, for that matter)

Parsing/decoding the object code and even worse, relying on GCC
plugins to annotate some of the idioms as they are being generated, in
order to infer intent on the part of the compiler goes *way* beyond
what we should be comfortable with. The whole point of this exercise
is to guarantee that there are no false positives when it comes to
deciding whether the kernel is in a live patchable state, and I don't
see how we can ever provide such a guarantee when it is built on such
a fragile foundation.

If we want to ensure that the stack contents are always an accurate
reflection of the real call stack, we should work with the toolchain
folks to identify issues that may interfere with this, and implement
controls over these behaviors that we can decide to use in the build.
In the past, I have already proposed adding a 'kernel' code model to
the AArch64 compiler that guarantees certain things, such as adrp/add
for symbol references, and no GOT indirections for position
independent code. Inhibiting optimizations that may impact our ability
to infer the real call stack from the stack contents is something we
might add here as well.

Another thing that occurred to me is that inferring which kernel code
is actually live in terms of pending function returns could be
inferred much more easily from a shadow call stack, which is a thing
we already implement for Clang builds.

In summary, I would not be in favor of enabling objtool on arm64 at
all until we have exhausted other options for providing the
functionality that we need it for (given that objtool provides many
other things that only x86 cares about, IIUC)
