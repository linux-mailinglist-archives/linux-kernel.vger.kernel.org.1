My workflow is often

  $ vi kernel/livepatch/core.c
  $ make kernel/livepatch/core.o

That way I don't have to wait to see what I broke (compile or objtool).

And if whatever I changed was in response to an objtool warning for
kernel/livepatch/core.o, and the warning didn't show up after doing the
above, I might stupidly assume I fixed it.

That's what I meant about it being confusing.  Maybe that's just me
though.
