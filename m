I noticed that this was included in the current pull request and I remembered that
I wasn't sure about this part. Did some more digging and it turns out that FWB
implies no cache maintenance needed for *data to instruction* coherence. From ARM
DDI 0487F.b, page D5-2635:

"When ARMv8.4-S2FWB is implemented, the architecture requires that
CLIDR_EL1.{LOUU, LOIUS} are zero so that no levels of data cache need to be
cleaned in order to manage coherency with instruction fetches".

However, there's no mention that I found for instruction to data coherence,
meaning that the icache would still need to be invalidated on each vcpu in order
to prevent fetching of patched instructions from the icache. Am I missing something?

Thanks,
Alex
