Arnd sent the pull request for this and I expected it to be pulled
from his tree, since he already had my approval for the change. Maybe
Linus was expecting it to come through me. This seems to have been a
miscommunication.

Frustratingly, I _still_ don't have an official tree on kernel.org for
the purpose of being the canonical place for linux-next to pull from,
due to policies around pgp keys and nobody following up on signing
mine. This is all really silly since there are ridiculously many
independent channels I could cryptographically validate identity
through with vanishing probability that they're all compromised. For
the time being I'll reactivate my repo on git.musl-libc.org.
