Subject: Re: [PATCH v3] mm: hugetlb: optionally allocate gigantic hugepages
 using cma 65;5803;1c Commit 944d9fec8d7a ("hugetlb: add support for gigantic
 page allocation at runtime") has added the run-time allocation of gigantic
 pages. However it actually works only at early stages of the system loading,
 when the majority of memory is free. After some time the memory gets
 fragmented by non-movable pages, so the chances to find a contiguous 1 GB
 block are getting close to zero. Even dropping caches manually doesn't help a
 lot.

It is a bit difficult to keep track of all the followup patches.  One
small issue below.

The documentation is already 'out of date' as you added support for arm64.
Not a huge deal as documentation rarely keeps up with code, but we should
at least be correct here.

I have a patch series in progress which cleans up existing hugetlb command
line processing.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20200401183819.20647-1-mike.kravetz@oracle.com/

No need to make any changes here, but assuming this support goes in first
I would make the following changes as part of my series:
- Don't list architectures in Documentation.  Just say support is arch
  dependent.
- Introduce some mechanism to print an error if hugetlb_cma is specified
  on the command line, but not supported by architecture.  IIUC, no message
  is printed today.  IMO, this only becomes important if the documentation
  does not list supported architectures.
 
Not insisting that documentation be updated to include arm64.
