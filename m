I think you are getting too focused on the uswapd use-case only. The
proposed interface enables the proactive reclaim as well which we
actually use in production.

Are you saying doing the compression asynchronously? Similar to how
the disk-based swap triggers the writeback and puts the page back to
LRU, so the next time reclaim sees it, it will be instantly reclaimed?
Or send the batch of pages to be compressed to a different CPU and
wait for the completion?

BTW the proactive reclaim naturally offloads that to a different context.

I don't see the exposure of internal memory reclaim implementation.
The interface is very simple. Reclaim a given amount of memory. Either
the kernel will reclaim less memory or it will over reclaim. In case
of reclaiming less memory, the user space can retry given there is
enough reclaimable memory. For the over reclaim case, the user space
will backoff for a longer time. How are the internal reclaim
implementation details exposed?

It is the limitation of the interface. My concern is in fixing the
interface we might convolute the memory.high interface making it more
burden to maintain than simply adding a new interface.
