Hmm, I like keeping them separated along similar lines to the other
code because it makes it easier to see the intended correspondence and
likely will keep the files more readable / smaller. I could
just move them out of arch/missing and into missing_check.c and so forth.

What do you think of that?

Yeah, that was the original reasoning and this is an artifact of the
previous patch set.

This makes sense. I'll incorporate that in the next posting.

Definitely -- I'll set them all to n above then we can just have one
ifeq block per arch.

Thanks for the Review!
