Yes, you're right.

Oh, yes, indeed. For some reason I confused myself thinking that we
also skip the access for software KASAN.

IIRC, no, but it will be executed right after we skip the brk.

Which one of these would be simpler to implement?

Perhaps we could somehow only skip faulting instructions that happen
in the KASAN test module?.. Decoding stack trace would be an option,
but that's a bit weird.

Overall, this feature is not essential, but will make testing simpler.

OK, we can do this.
