Please, find few comments below. They are primary about improving
the comments. There are also 3 ideas how to clean up the code
a bit[*].

Everything might be solved by followup patches. Well, I would prefer
to update the comments in the next respin if you do it because
of the third patch.[**]

The small code changes can be done later. I do not want to introduce
eventual problems at this stage.

[*] I have pretty good feeling about the code. And I really like the extensive
    comments. The remaining ideas are mostly from the nits department.

[**] We are getting close to push this into linux-next. I think that
     it makes sense only when also the 3rd patch is ready.

     Also we should have a solution for the crashdump/crash tools at hands.
     But I think that this is already the case.

This sounds strange. The information in the descriptor is valid when
the descriptor is in the committed or reusable state. But the data
in the data block are valid only when the related descriptor is in
the committed state.

The data block might get reused faster than the descriptor that owned
it earlier.

This is true. But this cross check is needed only when the assocoated
descriptor is found via the ID stored in the data block. It is not
needed when the data block is found via id/seq number stored in
the descriptor that is in commited state.


> + *   3) The data block is within the head/tail logical position range.

Also this is true. But it works by design. It does not need to be
checked when validating the data.

I would like to make this clear. So, I would write something like:


  The raw data stored in a data block can be considered valid when the
  the associated descriptor is in the committed state.

  The above condition is enough when the data block is found via
  information from the descriptor that was chosen by its ID.

  One more check is needed when the data block is found via
  blk_lpos.next stored in the descriptor for the previous data block.
  The data block might point to a descriptor in a committed state just
  by chance. It is the right one only when blk_lpos.begin points back
  to the data block.

I do not know. It might be to complicated. I actually did not mind
about the original text in previous versions. But I realize now that
it might have been the reason why the checks in data_make_reusable()
were too complicated in the previous versions.

AFAIK, the trailing '\0' is missing even the the text is not
truncated. We need to always add it here. Otherwise, we could not
print the text using %s below.

Also it means that it is not safe to copy the text using
memcpy(new_buf, &r.text_buf[0], r.text_len) because r.text_len
might be greater than r.text_bug_size.

I would prefer a more safe API where r.text_len is set to
the length that is really stored r.text_buf. The information
about truncation might be passed via another struct member,
e.g. r.text_truncated or so.

Well, this might be done later. The printk() code does not have
this problem because the length of the stored messages is
limited on the store side. The reader side uses buffers that
are always big enough. But I consider this error prone and
non-intuitive. It might hit us in the long term.

"array index values" makes the feeling that it is a direct position in
the array. We should make it clear that it is growing with each
overlap.

Also my understanding is that "tagged states" are the two bits.

See below for an alternative text.

Finally, lpos does does not include the tagged state. Or the meaning of "tagged
state" is rather confusing.

I would replace this with something like:

   To help avoid ABA issues, both descriptors and data blocks are
   referenced by logical positions that are growing with each
   wrap. Where the position of the descriptor is stored together
   with the state bits so that they can be manipulated atomically.

I am not sure that this list is really needs. It might get outdated
easily. It does not help me to make sure that all these barriers
are enough to keep the consistency.

That said, feel free to keep it if it helps anyone.

"raw data" is ambiguous here. Does it mean "data" array or the entire
structure. See below for an alternative text.

I think that the relation between desc.state_val, id, and, and state
bits is not descried anywhere. It might be confusing for someone
trying to understand the code for the first time.

Also we should make it clear that id is the logical position without
the state bits. For example, the meaning of DESC_COUNT, DATA_SIZE

It might really help to describe of all struct members here, e.g.

/**
 * struct prb_data_block: maps to the data block stored in the data ring
 *
 * @id: logical position in desc array (without state bits)
 * @data[0]: raw data stored by the writer
 */
struct prb_data_block {
	unsigned long	id;
	char		data[0];
};

This might deserve a description of possible n values: id, seq, state_val.

Is there any specific reason to check data_ring->data is not NULL,
please? It is not a bit deal. I am just curious because it is
not checked on other locations.

seq should never become zero here. It would take ages to overflow
and just creates false assumption about the logic. I would replace
this with for(;;)

It might be worth to add some information. And maybe also define who

We should emphasise that is should be manipulated only by
the ring_buffer code. Also @id and @text_space might deserve
some explanation. I think that it is better to use the full

It might be worth emphasizing that @s is internal value. The reader
should check r->seq to see that acutally read sequence number.

IMHO, it is not clearly visible from the code. At least, I had
to check prb_read_valid() to realize this,

That's it. Uff, it is a huge relief that there was nothing memory
