Catching up on the discussion which was going on while I was asleep...
So it sounds like there is a consensus that oom_adj should be moved to
mm_struct rather than trying to synchronize it among tasks sharing mm.
That sounds reasonable to me too. Michal answered all the earlier
questions about this patch, so I won't be reiterating them, thanks
Michal. If any questions are still lingering about the original patch
I'll be glad to answer them.
