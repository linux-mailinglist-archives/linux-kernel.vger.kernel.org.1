It should work on rocktech too. The patch mostly increases/reorders the delays
slightly, to match the controller documentation. I don't see a reason to
complicate the driver with per panel special delays, unless these patches don't
work on your panel.

The init sequence is still suboptimal, and doesn't follow the kernel docs
completely, even after these patches. Controller spec also talks about adding
some delay before enabling the backlight to avoid visual glitches.

Which is what enable callback is documented to be for. Currently part of the
initialization that belongs to prepare callback is also done in enable callback.

I see the glitch (small vertical shift of the image on powerup), but personally
don't care much to introduce even more delays to the driver, just for the
cosmetic issue.

regards,
	o.
