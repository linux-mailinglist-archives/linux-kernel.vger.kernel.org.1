The opposite is that the extended metadata might be missing for some
lines. This might cause quite some confusion.

For example, I can't find any reasonable way how to produce missing
timestamps.

From my POV, if we support 3 timestamps then they must be stored
reliably. And dict ring is out of the game.


And I am not comfortable even with the current dictionary handling.
I already wrote this somewhere. The following command is supposed
to show all kernel messages printed by "pci" subsystem:

	$> journalctl _KERNEL_SUBSYSTEM=pci

It will be incomplete when the dictionary metadata were not saved.

You might argue that the problem already exists when the entire
message gets lost. But this situation can be detected by missing
sequence numbers and journalctl even add messages about it.
But the user currently is not informed about missing
dictionary.


Regarding the waste of space. The dict ring currently has the same
size as the text ring. It is likely a waste of space as well. Any tuning
is complicated because it depends on the use case.

The advantage of the fixed @ext_info[] array is that everything is
clear, simple, and predictable (taken space and name length limits).
We could easily tell users what they will get for a given cost.
