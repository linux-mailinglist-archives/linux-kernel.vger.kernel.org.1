It can interfere with ATOMIC allocations in critical paths in extreme
circumstances as it potentially puts increased pressure on the emergency
reserve as watermarks are bypassed. That adds to the risk of a functional
failuure if reclaim fails to make progress.  The number of pages are likely
to be limited and unpredictable. As it uses any PCP type, it potentially
causes fragmention issues. For the last point, the allocations may be
transient in the RCU case now but not guaranteed forever. As the API is
in gfp.h, it's open to abuse so the next guy that comes along and thinks
"I am critical no matter what the name says" will cause problems. While
you could argue that would be caught in review, plenty of GFP flag abuses
made it through review.

Fundamentally, this is simply shifting the problem from RCU to the page
allocator because of the locking arrangements and hazard of acquiring zone
lock is a raw spinlock is held on RT. It does not even make the timing
predictable as an empty PCU list (for example, a full drain in low memory
situations) may mean the emergency path is hit anyway. About all it changes
is the timing of when the emergency path is hit in some circumstances --
it's not fixing the problem, it's simply changing the shape.

As the emergency path and synchronising can be hit no matter what, why
not increase the pool temporarily after the emergency path is hit and
shrink it again later if necessary?

OOM would only be a major factor if the size of the pools meant the
machine could not even operate or at least was severely degraded. However,
depleting the PCPU lists for RCU may slow kswapd making reclaim progress
and cause an OOM in itself, or at least an intervention by a userspace
monitor that kills non-critical applications in the background when memory
pressure exists.

After an emergency, temporarily increase the size of the pool to avoid
hitting the emergency path again in the near future.

That's not the same class of abuse as it can go to the buddy lists to
refill the correct PCP lists, avoid fragmentation issues, obeys watermarks
and wakes kswapd if it's not awake already.
