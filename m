Agreed.

That sounds like a lateral move in naming to me. The mapping prefix is
a slight improvement, but without the "find" it sounds like a refcount
operation and hides the fact that this is doing some sort of lookup
and has higher complexity.

It also makes working on this code easier on people not yet familiar
with it at the cost of people familiar with it. Remembering new names
for known concepts is a ton of mental churn.

So IMO the new names should be unambigously and significantly better
than the old ones to justify this.

Signed: somebody who is still struggling with the change from
exceptional entries in the radix tree to value entries in the xarray
(Are pointers or integers the values? Aren't they both "values"?)
