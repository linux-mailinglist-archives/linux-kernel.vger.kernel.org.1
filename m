Sorry I wasn't clear last time, but this still has the same fundamental issue:
it forces 64-bit kernels to be relocatable, which imposes a performance
penalty.  We don't have any hardware that can actually take advantage of sv48,
so I don't want to take anything that penalizes what people are actually using
in order to add a feature people can't use.

I'd be OK taking this if sv48 support simply depended on a relocatable kernel,
as then users who want the faster kernel could still build one.  I don't want
to take something that forces all 64-bit kernels to be relocatable.
