Actually on closer inspection it appears to be "correct" behaviour. I'm 
still subscribed to LAKML and the IOMMU list on this account, but 
normally Office 365 deduplicates so aggressively that I have rules set 
up to copy list mails that I'm cc'ed on back to my inbox, in case they 
arrive first and cause the direct copy to get eaten - apparently there's 
something unique about your email setup that manages to defeat the 
deduplicator and make it deliver all 3 copies intact... :/
