Subject: [PATCH v2 2/4] dt-bindings: mailbox: add doorbell support to ARM MHU
Date:   Thu,  8 Oct 2020 20:14:50 +0100
Message-Id: <20201008191452.38672-3-sudeep.holla@arm.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1

The ARM MHU's reference manual states following:

"The MHU drives the signal using a 32-bit register, with all 32 bits
logically ORed together. The MHU provides a set of registers to enable
software to set, clear, and check the status of each of the bits of this
register independently.  The use of 32 bits for each interrupt line
enables software to provide more information about the source of the
interrupt. For example, each bit of the register can be associated with
a type of event that can contribute to raising the interrupt."

This patch thus extends the MHU controller's DT binding to add support
for doorbell mode.

Though the same MHU hardware controller is used in the two modes, A new
compatible string is added here to represent the combination of the MHU
hardware and the firmware sitting on the other side (which expects each
bit to represent a different signal now).
