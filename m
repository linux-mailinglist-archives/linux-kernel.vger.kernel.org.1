Not true at all, please read:
    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/stable-kernel-rules.html
for how to do this properly.  Please do not spread incorrect
information.

And Jason did this properly, he put cc: stable@ in the s-o-b area and
all is good, I will pick up this patch once it hits Linus's tree.

And there is no problem actually sending the patch to stable@vger while
under development like this, as it gives me a heads-up that something is
coming, and is trivial to filter out.

If you really want to be nice, you can just do:
	cc: stable@kernel.org
which goes to /dev/null on kernel.org, so no email will be sent to any
list, but my scripts still pick it up.  But no real need to do that,
it's fine.

> Also, the fixes tags are really quite sufficient.

No it is not, I have had to dig out patches more and more because people
do NOT put the cc: stable and only put Fixes:, which is not a good thing
as I then have to "guess" what the maintainer/developer ment.

Be explicit if you know it, cc: stable please.

Those "bots" are still driven by a lot of human work, please make it
easy on us whenever possible.

thanks,
