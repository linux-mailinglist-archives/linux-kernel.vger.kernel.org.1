I really fail to see a difference. It is clear the one is subset of the
other but in practical life tasks might come and go at any time and if
you try to reduce the hard limit and there are no tasks that could be
reclaimed then I believe we should complain whether it is only oom
disabled tasks or no tasks at all. It is certainly unexpected situation
in some cases because there are resources which are bound to the memcg
without any task we can act on.

This is very much possible situation when all eligible tasks have been
already killed but they didn't really help to resolve the oom situation
- e.g. in kernel memory leak or unbounded shmem consumption etc...
