It is unfortunate that you relied on the behavior that's changed, sorry about
that.

Reverting the above commit is still an option, so please let me know if you
want me to do that.

Well, feel free to propose specific changes in there.

This way one can only say whether or not a key has been pressed during the
period between two consecutive wakeup_count reads.  That may not even be
related to waking up the system from sleep, though.

Thanks!
