Right.  Also I assumed the kernel space DAMON users as the primary users of
this feature.

Seems you are saying about the user space DAMON use.  Indeed, it would be quite
complicated.  For example, maybe the user space could read '/proc/pid/pagemap'
of every process, but this really sounds awkward.  Thank you for pointing this
:)  Even in the virtual address case, it could be complicated.

For this reason, I am developing DAMON-based Operation Schemes[1].  It is
designed to do the monitoring and optimization of specific regions fit in
special monitoring result by DAMON itself.  Nonetheless, current version of it
supports only virtual address spaces.  A support of physical address space from
the feature will be another future work.

If the user space really need to do that by itself, we could provide the
physical address to virtual address mapping info in addition to the monitoring
result in future.

And, yes, we have so many TODO tasks that really necessary.  I will eventually
do all of those, but also concerning about my limited time.  Nevertheless, I
believe it would better to focus on the core of DAMON[2] for now and continue
further TODO tasks after it is merged in the mainline, because maintainance of
the code will be much easier and hopefully more developers could collaborate
for the many TODO tasks.
