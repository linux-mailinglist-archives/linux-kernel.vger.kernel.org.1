Hi Hugh,

Thanks for comments!

There are some discussion on this point a couple of weeks ago,
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/9/760

Matthew Wilcox and Kirill have the following comments,
> I don't understand how we get to split_huge_page() with a page that's
> not on an LRU list.  Both anonymous and page cache pages should be on
> an LRU list.  What am I missing?

Right, and it's never got removed from LRU during the split. The tail
pages have to be added to LRU because they now separate from the tail
page.

So the only path to the removed part should be a bug, like  sth here,
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/10/118
or
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/10/972

I am not object to merge them into one, I just don't know how to say
clear about 2 patches in commit log. As patch 18, TestClearPageLRU
add the incorrect posibility of remove lru bit during split, that's
the reason of code path rewrite and a WARN there.

Thanks
Alex

I thought the xa_lock and lru_lock relationship was described clear
in the commit log, and still no idea of the move_lock in the chain.
Please refill them for what I overlooked.
Thanks!

Ok. let's remove his signed-off.

the gain based on the patch 26.

single linked list is more saving, but do we have to reverse walking to seek
the head or tail for correct sequence?

Ok, looking forward for your new solution!
