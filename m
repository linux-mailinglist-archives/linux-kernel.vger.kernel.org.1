That POC tool looks ugly for now as it only a draft to prove this
works, sorry about it.

For the patch, yes, it is expecting IOMMU to lower the chance of
potential DMA issue, and expecting DMA will not hit userspace/free
page, or at least won't override a massive amount of reusable old
memory. And I thought about some solutions for the potential DMA
issue.

As old memories are used as a block device, which is proxied by
userspace, so upon each IO, the userspace tool could do an integrity
check of the corresponding data stored in old mem, and keep multiple
copies of the data. (eg. use 512M of old memory to hold a 128M block
device). These copies will be kept far away from each other regarding
the physical memory location. The reusable old memories are sparse so
the actual memory containing the data should be also sparse.
So if some part is corrupted, it is still recoverable. Unless the DMA
went very wrong and wiped a large region of memory, but if such thing
happens, it's most likely kernel pages are also being wiped by DMA, so
the vmcore is already corrupted and kdump may not help. But at least
it won't fail silently, the userspace tool can still do something like
dump some available data to an easy to setup target.

And also that's one of the reasons not using old memory as kdump's
memory directly.

The problem with the user space is that, kdump is expected to dump to
different kinds of dump targets, and there are some very memory
consuming ones, eg. the NFSv3 case. And there are many other labor
heavy jobs for the dump target setup, like network setup, lvm setup,
iscsi setup, multipath etc, etc, not to mention potential corner cases
with these dump targets. And it is not practical to reimplement them
again in a memory friendly way.

And the user space is growing, even if user only included "bash
makedumpfile ssh ip" and required libs in initramfs, which are
essential for dumping the vmcore over SSH (dump over SSH is commonly
used), the initramfs will take 20M after decompressed.

The kernel driver memory usage is trackable and I only encountered a
few of such issues, and many have applied workaround for kdump. And if
userspace memory pressure is reduced, kernel will also have more
memory.

And now in Fedora, it is using the existing tool Dracut to generate
the initramfs, which heavily depends on systemd indeed. Even with
these helpers, it has been taking quite some work to support all the
dump targets.
