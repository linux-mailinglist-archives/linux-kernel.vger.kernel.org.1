Only with the fix 
"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200422220430.254014-5-irogers@google.com/" 
(without other json modifications), the issue was still there.

localhost:~ # perf stat -M DRAM_Read_Latency
event syntax error: 
'../event=0x36,,umask=0x21/,cha/event=0x35,cha_0/event=0x0/}:W,duration_time'
                                   \___ parser error

  Usage: perf stat [<options>] [<command>]

     -M, --metrics <metric/metric group list>
                           monitor specified metrics or metric groups 
(separated by ,)

So you added other commits which changed the json to let the parse work. 
But I don't know if we have to do with this way because it should be a 
regression issue.

In my opinion, we'd better fix the issue in 26226a97724d ("perf expr: 
Move expr lexer to flex") and try not to change the json if possible.

Thanks
Jin Yao
