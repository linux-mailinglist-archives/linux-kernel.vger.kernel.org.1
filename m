Brief looking into the code raises several questions:
 - is it driver from the last decade?
 - why it's not using what kernel provides?
 - we have a lot of nice helpers:
   - DMA Engine API
   - BIT() and GENMASK() macros
   - tons of different helpers like regmap API (if you wish to dump
registers via debugfs)

Can you shrink this driver by 20-30% (I truly believe it's possible)
and split DMA driver to drivers/dma (which may already have something
similar there)?
