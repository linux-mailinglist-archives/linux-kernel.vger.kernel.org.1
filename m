What a mess.  This is no way to upstream a new driver.

Firstly, could you please add versioning to your submissions.  I know
this at least version 2.  Were there previous submissions?  Is this
the latest?

Secondly and more importantly, you have submitted what looks like a
new driver (bearing in mind that I'm only concerning myself with the
MFD related changes), then in the same submission you are adding and
removing large chunks.  Please just submit the new driver, on its own
as a single patch, complete with its associated Makefile and Kconfig
changes.

What are your reasons for submitting this via Staging?  Is it not
ready yet?  Are the resultant components not at a high enough level of
quality or enablement to go straight into the subsystems, which is
more typical?  From an MFD perspective, I would be reviewing the
driver as a whole when (if) it moves from Staging into MFD anyway, so
why are you jumping through hoops with this additional, seemingly
superfluous step?

Finally, the subject of authorship is often a contentious one, but
this is a problem you need to work out with the original author, not
something that should require special handing by upstream.  You have a
couple of choices, but bear in mind that upstreaming a non-suitable
driver then bringing it up to standard is not one of them.

1. Keep the original author's authorship and SoB, make your changes
   and get them to review to ensure they are still happy about being
   associated with the resultant code.  Ensure you mention all of the
   changes you make in the commit message and follow-up by adding your
   own SoB.

2. This is the contentious bit.  If you've made enough changes, there
   is an argument for you to adopt authorship.  You should discuss
   with the original author whether they are happy for you to retain
   their SoB.  My suggestion is always try to keep the SoB as a bare
   minimum to preserve patch history and out of pure courtesy.
