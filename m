Can you pls file a bug report, linking to this thread here?

Maybe also link to the docs:

https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/gpu/drm-kms.html?highlight=3Ddrm_plane=
#c.drm_plane_type

"For userspace which is universal plane aware and which is using that
atomic IOCTL there=E2=80=99s no difference between these planes (beyong wha=
t
the driver and hardware can support of course)."

Also feel free to cc me on the github issue (I'm @danvet over there)
in case there's more questions.

Cheers, Daniel
