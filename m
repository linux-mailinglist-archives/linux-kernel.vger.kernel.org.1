Based on my 30 years of experience, from c64 to amiga to *nix, and the 
amiga was Irix inspired, I have made the instance Queen Ar 3-D, and 
suggest a unified effort in a Queen Ar 3-D engine and and levelmaker, 
that could interface with a Queen Ar open hw graphics card.

That would be the *nix way to do things.

And the 3-D scene then is represented optimally on *nix. With the 
levelmaker enabling anyone who did 3-D before, to do this now on *nix, 
and related codewizards putting the necessary stuff into the engine.

All readied for integrated €uro, or the equivalent where you live.
