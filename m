Ah, maybe still that.  The B-tree records the start of the mapping in
the tree, but we still keep vma->vm_start as pointing to the current top
of the stack (it's still the top if it grows down ... right?)  The key is
that these numbers may now be different, so from the tree's point of view,
the vm addresses for 1MB below the stack appear to be occupied.  From the
VMA's point of view, the stack finishes where it was last accessed.

We also get rid of the insanity of "return the next VMA if there's no
VMA at this address" which most of the callers don't want and have to
check for.  Again, from the tree's point of view, there is a VMA at this
address, but from the VMA's point of view, it'll need to expand to reach
that address.

I don't think this piece is implemented yet, but it's definitely planned.
