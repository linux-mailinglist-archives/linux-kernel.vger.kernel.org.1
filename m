Hehe, no I didn't mean 0x5 * 4 = 0x20 because I mentioned 320KB and 2MB 
specifically
for the same reason in case people think that ;) I just meant that we 
are correcting
the copied size from SDM845, but I agree I need to make it clear in the 
commit msg
which warrants a V2.

No, it is not required to fix any functional problems but is correcting 
the
wrong size which I think qualifies for a fixes tag? I don't have a 
strong opinion
though, so I can remove the tag if you feel strongly about it.

It's not describing the cache size, it is the LLCC(LLC Controller) 
register space.
But I believe that the confusion is because of my commit msg, so I will 
post a v2
clearing this with something like below (I have removed the confusing 4 
banks info
of SDM845).

"
There is one LLCC logical bank(LLCC0) on SC7180 SoC and the size of the 
LLCC0 base
is 0x50000(320KB) not 2MB, so correct the size and fix copy paste 
mistake
carried over from SDM845.
"

Thanks,
Sai
