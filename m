As I said before, there is no X on left-hand of this formula. To
access all Pn and
re-access P1, we need 1200M file list scan and reclaim. More scan isn't nee=
ded.
With your patch "limit the range of LRU type balancing", scan ratio
between file/anon
list is limited to 0.5 ~ 2.0, so, maximum anon scan would be 1200 M *
2.0, that is,
2400 M and not bounded by X. That means that file list cannot be
stable with some X.

If my lastly found example is a correct example (your confirm is required),
it is also related to the correctness issue since cold pages causes
eviction of the hot pages repeatedly.

In this case, they (without patch, with patch) all have some correctness
issue so we need to judge which one is better in terms of overall impact.
I don't have strong opinion about it so it's up to you to decide the way to=
 go.

Thanks.
