Two things, one unnecessary mixers, second thing is we need to know how 
many FE dais are in the system, which should be derived from the number 
of dai child nodes. These can potentially be SoC specific or firmware 
specific.

My plan is to cleanup the BE DAIs as well!, any patches welcome!

I think this is mistake from myside. Alteast according to bindings 
direction property is only "Required for Compress offload dais", code 
should have explicitly ignored it. Here is change that should fix it.
