Right!  Thanks for sharing your opinion. :)

Yes, but this is like a radical change.  This would be nice to deal
with repetition in the event list.  But I guess mostly we only use a
small number of events (beside the cgroups)...

Right.  I wonder whether they're gonna take the new option
(maybe --for-each-cgroup ?) or not regardless of the syntax change.

Thanks
