Because the high limit reclaim is a best effort rather than must to
either get over reclaim watermarks and continue allocation or meet the
hard limit requirement to continue.

In an ideal world even the global resp. hard limit reclaim should
consider fairness. They don't because that is easier but that sucks. I
have been involved in debugging countless of issues where direct reclaim
was taking too long because of the unfairness. Users simply see that as
bug and I am not surprised.

This would be quite challenging considering the page allocator wouldn't
be able to make a forward progress without doing any reclaim. But maybe
you can be creative with watermarks.

I have tried to explain my thinking elsewhere in the thread. The bottom
line is that high limit is a way of throttling rather than meeting a
specific target. With the current implementation we scale the reclaim
activity by the consumer's demand which is something that is not
terribly complex to wrap your head around and reason about. Because the
objective is to not increase the excess much. It offers some sort of
fairness as well. I fully recognize that a full fairness is not
something we can target but working reasonably well most of the time
sounds good enough for me.

I do see your point of course. But I do not give the code consistency
a higher priority than the potential unfairness aspect of the user
visible behavior for something that can do better. Really the direct
reclaim unfairness is really painfull and hard to explain to users. You
can essentially only hand wave that system is struggling so fairness is
not really a priority anymore.

I have to admit that I would prefer a much less aggressive tone. We are
discussing a topic which is obviously not black and white and there are
different aspects of it.

Thanks!
