I was thinking in terms of a bit in the rcu_data structure into
which rcu_nocb_lock() and friends stored the status, and from which
rcu_nocb_unlock() and friends retrieved that same status.  Sort of like
how preemptible RCU uses the ->rcu_read_lock_nesting field in task_struct.

As noted, this does require reworking the hotplug code to avoid the
current holding of two such locks concurrently, which I am happy to do
if that helps.

Or am I missing a subtle (or not-so-subtle) twist here?

I was assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that an intermediate phase between
not-offloaded and offloaded would take care of all of those cases.

Unless and until someone does a copy-pasta, thus unconditionally
doing the wrong thing.  ;-)

If we cannot avoid different spellings of ->cblist in different places,
such is life, but I do want to make sure that we have fully considered
the alternatives.

						Thanx, Paul
