exclusive cpusets is used now to control scheduler load balancing on
a group of cpus.  It seems to me that this is the same idea and is part
of the isolation concept.  Having a toggle for each subsystem/feature in
cpusets could provide the needed userspace api. 

Under the covers it might be implemented as twiddling various cpumasks.

We need to be shifting to managing load balancing with cpusets anyway.
