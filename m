This looks sane to me!
Acked-by: Christian Brauner <christian.brauner@ubuntu.com>

One thing I noticed when checking the failure paths. In init_listener we
allocate the notifier by directly storing it into filter->notif and if
anon_inode_getfile() fails we simply kfree(filter->notif) but don't NULL
it and leave filter->notif pointing to freed memory.
Since we have a few places where we check filter->notif whether it is
initialized or not maybe we should NULL filter->notif if init_listener()
fails or alloc the notifier into a tmp variable and only assign it to
filter->notif after we can't fail anymore in init_listener().

Just a thought since the error path in seccomp_set_mode_filter() is a
little more complex. :)

Thanks!
Christian
