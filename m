I don't think there's a compatibility issue here though. The current 
kernel doesn't care if the property is longer than 1 base+size. It only 
checks if the size is less than 1 base+size. And yes, we can rely on 
that implementation detail. It's only an ABI if an existing user 
notices.

Now, if the low memory is listed first, then an older kdump kernel 
would get a different memory range. If that's a problem, then define 
that low memory goes last.
