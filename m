...replying to my early self here (o_O)....I'd add that I've tested the above changes (removing
initialized and enabled) triggering this _exit path by brutally unbinding the platform protocol
driver and I can see the notifications flow stop and the queues emptied as expected without
tragedy...the SCMI stack in general is not so happy though at that point, since it is not even
supposed to be unloaded ever in fact...I wonder if this limit condition(unbind of a core SCMI
driver which is not even modularizable in Kconfig) makes sense to be tested at all...
(if not for testing this specific code path...)
