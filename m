I am sorry I am still not bought in. I think the parts you're talking about are
in the lockless part of the scheduler which are really hard to debug as several
cpus could be traversing these data from different code paths. But here this is
just extra churn.

If an imbalance has happend this means either:

	1. enqueue/dequeue_task() is imablanced itself
	2. uclamp_update_active() calls dec without inc.

If 1 happened we have more reasons to be worried about. For 2 the function
takes task_rq_lock() and does dec/inc in obvious way.

So I don't see any reason to add new info in task_struct and sprinkle #ifdefs
to protect against something that I can't see we can't reason correctly about
now.

We don't use pr_debug() in scheduler (I guess no computer would have booted
with that on), otherwise that would have been a good candidate for one, yes.
But we can't do that.

Thanks
