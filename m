There is a race if we allow other CPUs to exit without pm lock
below scenarios can happen.

1. for the last cpu (CPU-x) CPU_PM_ENTER notification came
2. On CPU-x, rpmh_flush() is in progress with drv->lock held, which is 
at the flush_batch() stage
3. Meanwhile any other CPU (CPU-y) woken up and did CPU_PM_EXIT
4. From the woken up cpu, rpmh_invalidate() is invoked.
5. It takes ctrlr->cache_lock and empties the cached batch requests 
(making list empty and kfree() the cached requests)
6. The last cpu (CPU-x) which was doing rpmh_flush() suddently gets the 
list empty which it was traversing in flush_batch(),
    leading to null pointer derefence.

To Fix above race condtion, ctrlr->cache_lock should be taken inside 
rpmh_flush() starting point.
also need to remove lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled() which got insterted, 
since IRQ might be enabled by this time if some CPU exits.

Maulik
