Great, thank you for testing.

No need to feel bad, I know the feeling, many people mangle
my last name. So I always try to get this right.

So I will fix the mis-spelling of your name and change the:

Reported-by: Samuel Čavoj <samuel@cavoj.net>

to:

Reported-and-tested-by: Samuel Čavoj <samuel@cavoj.net>

And then submit this upstream.

Yes, I just hope that the fix works for the model in the
bugzilla too. I expect it will, but you never know.

You're welcome, thank you for helping me quickly address this
regression.
