Interesting.

So the original Cadence DP patches for TI SoCs did create a common driver with Rockchip's older mhdp
driver. And looks like the IMX series points to an early version of that patch ("drm/rockchip:
prepare common code for cdns and rk dpi/dp driver").

We gave up on that as the IPs did have differences and the firmwares used were apparently quite
different. The end result was very difficult to maintain, especially as (afaik) none of the people
involved had relevant Rockchip HW.

The idea was to get a stable DP driver for TI SoCs ready and upstream, and then carefully try to
create common parts with Rockchip's driver in small pieces.

If the Rockchip and IMX mhdp have the same IP and same firmware, then they obviously should share
code as done in the series you point to.

Perhaps Cadence can clarify the differences between IMX, TI and Rockchip IPs and FWs?

I'm worried that if there are IP differences, even if not great ones, and if the FWs are different
and developed separately, it'll be a constant "fix X for SoC A, and accidentally break Y for SoC B
and C", especially if too much code is shared.

In the long run I'm all for a single driver (or large shared parts), but I'm not sure if we should
start with that approach.
