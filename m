I think the objections I remember were on using lkml.org rather than
lkml.kernel.org. Sorry!

My assumption would be that while lore may fade (it hasn't been there for
that long, who knows what will come next), lkml.kernel.org ought to be
perennial. Keyword here being "assumption".

Providing it isn't too much of a head scratcher (and admittedly what I am
suggesting is borderline here), I believe it is worthwhile to add debug
helps in what is assumed to be impossible cases - even more so in this case
seeing as it had been deemed worth to check previously. We've been proved
wrong on the "impossible" nature of some things before.

We have a few of those checks strewn over the scheduler code, so it's not
like we would be starting a new trend.

Hence why I'd put this under CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG.
