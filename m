That happens to all of us!

Sounds good.

You may want to simplify your commit message and just state what you 
described, e.g.

"Since 64xfs clocks cannot be generated, the NAU8825 is configured to 
re-generate its system clock from the BCLK using the FLL. The link is 
configured to use a 48kHz frame rate, and 24 bits in 25-bit slot. The 
SSP configuration is extracted from NHLT settings and not dynamically 
changed. Listening tests and measurements do not show any distortion or 
issues".
