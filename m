Can't printk hold that lock through console/netconsole?

I want to believe that the timestamp are not correct, have no clue if it
is even possible.

But let's talk about facts:
1. It is started after -rc1 (we don't test linux-next).
2. This workaround helped to eliminate the splat.
3. My machine experiences the extra splat all the time
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200414070502.GR334007@unreal/

Unfortunately, I can't bisect because the failure mentioned in the
commit message because it  doesn't happen on one machine all the time,
but when we are talking about night run regression, at least one of the
runners hits such lockdep prints.

I can add to our regression any debug patch and get results day after,
if it helps.
