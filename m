PS: there's another fun issue here:

fill a file with zeroes
mmap that file in two areas, MAP_SHARED
thread 1:
munmap() the first area
fill the second one with 'X'
thread 2:
write() from the first area into pipe

One could expect that nothing by zeroes gets written into
pipe - it might be a short write() (or -EFAULT), but finding
any 'X' there would be a bug.

Your patches allow for a possibility of write() doing
get_user_pages_fast(), getting the first page just as
munmap() is about to remove it from page tables and bugger
off.  Then thread 1 proceeds with the store (via the
second area).  And then thread 2 does memcpy() from that
thing via a kmap_atomic()-created alias, observing the
effect of the store.

That might or might not be a POSIX violation, but it does
look like a QoI issue...
