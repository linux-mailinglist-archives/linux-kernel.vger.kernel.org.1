I don't think so, but I haven't looked at the migration path at all.
I'm hoping it "just works", but experience with the rest of the mm has
taught me there's probably an assumption in there that THP => PMD that
will need to be fixed.  I'm not currently testing on a NUMA machine, and
I'm still debugging other paths.
