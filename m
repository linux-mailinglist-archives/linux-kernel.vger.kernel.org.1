Subject: [PATCH] perf vendor events: Update Skylake client events to v50
Date:   Wed,  4 Nov 2020 09:51:02 +0800
Message-Id: <20201104015102.30363-1-yao.jin@linux.intel.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

- Update Skylake events to v50.
- Update Skylake JSON metrics from TMAM 4.0.
- Fix the issue in DRAM_Parallel_Reads
- Fix the perf test warning

Before:

root@kbl-ppc:~# perf stat -M DRAM_Parallel_Reads -- sleep 1
event syntax error: '{arb/event=0x80,umask=0x2/,arb/event=0x80,umask=0x2,thresh=1/}:W'
                     \___ unknown term 'thresh' for pmu 'uncore_arb'

valid terms: event,edge,inv,umask,cmask,config,config1,config2,name,period,percore

Initial error:
event syntax error: '..umask=0x2/,arb/event=0x80,umask=0x2,thresh=1/}:W'
                                  \___ Cannot find PMU `arb'. Missing kernel support?

root@kbl-ppc:~# perf test metrics
10: PMU events                                 :
10.3: Parsing of PMU event table metrics               : Skip (some metrics failed)
10.4: Parsing of PMU event table metrics with fake PMUs: Ok
67: Parse and process metrics                  : Ok

After:

root@kbl-ppc:~# perf stat -M MEM_Parallel_Reads -- sleep 1

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

         4,951,646      arb/event=0x80,umask=0x2/ #    26.30 MEM_Parallel_Reads       (50.04%)
           188,251      arb/event=0x80,umask=0x2,cmask=1/                                     (49.96%)

       1.000867010 seconds time elapsed

It is counted on a dedicated fixed counter, leaving the four (eight when Hyperthreading is disabled) programmable counters available for other events. Note: On all current platforms this event stops counting during 'throttling (TM)' states duty off periods the processor is 'halted'.  The counter update is done at a lower clock rate then the core clock the overflow status bit for this counter may appear 'sticky'.  After the counter has overflowed and software clears the overflow status bit and resets the counter to less than MAX. The reset value to the counter is not clocked immediately so the overflow status bit will flip 'high (1)' and generate another PMI (if enabled) after which the reset value gets clocked into the counter.
