I wanted to keep it pause and resume because it could get confusing for 
someone
looking at this pair of APIs, that a client driver would also need to 
"start"
channels after "preparing" them. Since that is not that case, and the
mhi_prepare_for_transfer() API itself is supposed to also start the 
channels, it
would be better to keep these as "pause" and "resume" instead IMO.

Any comments in favor or "stop" and "start"?

Your idea is good but it would not have much additional benefits and 
would
involve MHI core "enabling" channels and allocating memory for each 
channel
context when they are only declared as supported by the controller but 
are not
actually being put to use.

mhi_prepare_for_transfer() does both channel context initialization and 
starts
the channels, which is good because it allocates memory when needed. So, 
this
benefits system memory if a controller with support for many channels 
exists but
only a few channels are used.

Regarding the states to track from host:
-> DISABLED (We know channels are not active: in reset state or not 
probed yet)
-> ENABLED (Active and running when needed for data transfers)
-> STOP (Paused: leaves the channel context as is since channels are not 
reset)
-> SUSPENDED (Unload in progress: Entered before resetting 
channels/remove())

BTW, we have the debugfs entry for "channels" that dumps the context to 
show
exactly what the channel states are from device perspective. We can rely 
on it
if needed.

If there are some comments I can add to make things clear, please let me 
know.

Thanks,
Bhaumik
