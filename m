Code churn to keep code checkers quiet for pointless reasons?  What
could go wrong with that...

It should be pretty obvious to any reader that you are in a sysfs show
method, as almost all of them are trivially tiny and obvious.  Yes, it
doesn't help with those that make blanket statements like "sprintf is
evil", but I think that kind of just shows them that they shouldn't be
making foolish blanket statements like that :)

Anyway, we've had this for 20 years, if sysfs calls are the only left
remaining user of sprintf(), then I'll be glad to consider using a
"wrapper" function or macro.

thanks,
