I can imagine the same holds true for us there.

I just want to avoid yet another implementation of the underlying
mechanism. For DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS we can mess with the LR before
pauth or SCS sees it, so those definitely work.

If KRETPROBES works by messing with the LR at the instnat the function
is entered, that should work similarly. If it works by replacing the
RET it should also work out since any pauth/SCS work will have been
undone by that point. If it attempts to mess with the return address in
the middle of a function then it's not reliable today.

I'll take a look, since

Sounds like I might need to do some digging...

Mark.
