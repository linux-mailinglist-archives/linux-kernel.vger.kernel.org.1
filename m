The grub EFI handover entry patch is busted in mixed-mode for another
reason -- while it allocates init_size, it doesn't use the correct
alignment. I tested on a Debian buster VM in mixed-mode (that was the
one I was able to get to install/boot with mixed-mode), and the early
pagetable from startup_32 ends up in unallocated memory due to the
rounding up of the bzImage address to account for kernel alignment. This
would be an existing problem prior to these patches.

Should we try to handle this in the kernel? At some point KASLR is going
to pick that memory for the kernel and overwrite the pagetables I would
think, resulting in sporadic crashes that are almost unreproducible.
