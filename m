I appreciate your time. But if you are looking for some grand
justification, I'm afraid I won't be able to give one, because, as it's
titled, this is just a series of cleanup patches.

My questions above are meant to determine which parts are not clear.
Well, I still don't know. So let's try this. What's your impression upon
reading the first sentence of this patch?

Here is how I would think when I read it (which is purely subjective
since I wrote it):

  'replaces the only (an outlier) open-coded (bad) with
   page_off_lru() (the norm)'

It seems to me it has everything I need to know (or say). Of course I
could spell them all out for you if that's how you'd prefer. And if
it's not enough, then please show me some examples and I'll study
them carefully and try my best to follow them.
