Looking into this some more, I see we do have..

static const struct of_device_id of_skipped_node_table[] = {
         { .compatible = "operating-points-v2", },
         {} /* Empty terminated list */
};

..in drivers/of/platform.c, so its not being added to the device list.

And atleast in case of qup, I am having to duplicate the OPP tables once for
each qup instance. Not to mention, having them inside the first qup device
just makes it a little confusing to read who the OPP table belongs to.
