I would think the simpler way to proceed is to have a device specific
property indicating that standard mode is not available. From the
driver, you can then switch from standard to DSM when this property is
present.

I think it is difficult to come up with a generic property for that as
most other RTCs with level/threshold switching have a fast edge
detection feature that is usually enabled by default. So what they would
require instead is a property indicating that the voltage is ramping
down at a certain rate allowing to disable fast edge detection and
saving a bit of power.
