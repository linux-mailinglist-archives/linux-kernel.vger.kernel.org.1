Subject: [PATCH v4 tip/core/rcu 06/15] kcsan: Update API documentation in kcsan-checks.h
Date:   Wed, 15 Apr 2020 11:34:02 -0700
Message-Id: <20200415183411.12368-6-paulmck@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.9.5
In-Reply-To: <20200415183343.GA12265@paulmck-ThinkPad-P72>
References: <20200415183343.GA12265@paulmck-ThinkPad-P72>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Marco Elver <elver@google.com>

Update the API documentation for ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_* macros and make them
generate readable documentation for the code examples.

All @variable short summaries were missing ':', which was updated for
the whole file.

Tested with "make htmldocs".
