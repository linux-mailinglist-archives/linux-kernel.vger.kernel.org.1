Good point, I think Documentation/driver-api/ is good for now as there
are no other IOMMU docs.

Yes, I meant guest IOVA for mdev which has "multiple IOVA spaces per
device" based on aux domain. I will add this to the IOVA case description.

"The primary use cases for IOASID are Shared Virtual Address (SVA) and
multiple IOVA spaces per device. However, the requirements for IOASID
management can vary among hardware architectures.

For baremetal IOVA, IOASID #0 is used for DMA request without
PASID. Even though some architectures such as VT-d also offers
the flexibility of using any PASIDs for DMA request without PASID.
PASID #0 is reserved and not allocated from any ioasid_set.

Multiple IOVA spaces per device are mapped to auxiliary domains which
can be used for mediated device assignment with and without a virtual
IOMMU (vIOMMU). An IOASID is allocated for each auxiliary domain as default
PASID. Without vIOMMU, default IOASID is used for DMA map/unmap
APIs. With vIOMMU, default IOASID is used for guest IOVA where DMA
request with PASID is required for the device. The reason is that
there is only one PASID #0 per device, e.g. VT-d, RID_PASID is per PCI
device.
