Hi Trent,

> When alt mode 6 is not available, fallback to the kernel <= 5.7 behavior
> of always using alt mode 1.
> 
> Prior to kernel 5.8, btusb would always use alt mode 1 for WBS (Wide
> Band Speech aka mSBC aka transparent SCO).  In commit baac6276c0a9
> ("Bluetooth: btusb: handle mSBC audio over USB Endpoints") this
> was changed to use alt mode 6, which is the recommended mode in the
> Bluetooth spec (Specifications of the Bluetooth System, v5.0, Vol 4.B
> §2.2.1).  However, many if not most BT USB adapters do not support alt
> mode 6.  In fact, I have been unable to find any which do.
> 
> In kernel 5.8, this was changed to use alt mode 6, and if not available,
> use alt mode 0.  But mode 0 has a zero byte max packet length and can
> not possibly work.  It is just there as a zero-bandwidth dummy mode to
> work around a USB flaw that would prevent device enumeration if
> insufficient bandwidth were available for the lowest isoc mode
> supported.
> 
> In effect, WBS was broken for all USB-BT adapters that do not support
> alt 6, which appears to nearly all of them.
> 
> Then in commit 461f95f04f19 ("Bluetooth: btusb: USB alternate setting 1 for
> WBS") the 5.7 behavior was restored, but only for Realtek adapters.
> 
> I've tested a Broadcom BRCM20702A and CSR 8510 adapter, both work with
> the 5.7 behavior and do not with the 5.8.
> 
> So get rid of the Realtek specific flag and use the 5.7 behavior for all
> adapters as a fallback when alt 6 is not available.  This was the
> kernel's behavior prior to 5.8 and I can find no adapters for which it
> is not correct.  And even if there is an adapter for which this does not
> work, the current behavior would be to fall back to alt 0, which can not
> possibly work either, and so is no better.
