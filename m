I did consider this when reviewing the support we have now, but I didn't
see a way to make it reliably run inbetween the stop and start during a
recovery.
Now we have the rproc_unprepare_subdevices(), so that might have worked
out, although you probably only want this when crashed = true.

That said, I don't think you should see subdevice == device here, we can
create a new device (to host the sysfs attribute) regardless of it being
a "subdevice" or not. I do however not see that the two* booleans
warrants the complexity a new device comes with.

It's not adequate to depend on compilation options, we really want these
features to be functional in a multiplatform kernel (e.g. upstream
arm64 defconfig)

But for certain resource constraint devices, where alternative means of
debugging the remoteprocs exists it does make sense to be able to
disable the coredumps altogether, so I think we should move the coredump
functionality out of core.c and include it conditionally using Kconfig.

Sounds good, then from where we are now we at least need to allow
disabling of the coredump collection.

This sounds quite interesting. I'm not sure about turning the coredump
handling into its own device and use this for decoupling it from the
core, but I'm looking forward to see your patches.
