Because WRMSR is cheap, right?

You have to unconditionally {dis,en}able it on #DB entry/exit. Not only
when it's a DR_BUS_LOCK, _always_. Then maybe. I'm too tired to think
through the IST mess.

IST's suck, they're horrible crap.

Suppose we get a #DB, then we get an NMI right before it does WRMSR, so
BUS_LOCK is still on, then the NMI does a dodgy LOCK op, we die.

So that means, you get to disable it on every NMI-like exception too,
but we happen to care about performance for those, you loose.


Also, what happens if you have a hardware watchpoint on the instruction
that causes DR_BUS_LOCK? Does that work as expected?
