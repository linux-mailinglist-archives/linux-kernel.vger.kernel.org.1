The SMT mask would be inaccurate on the P8, rather than the current case
where it's inaccurate on the P9.

Which would be our preference, because the backward migration case is
not common AIUI.

Or am I missing a reason we'd be even more toast than that?

Under PowerVM the kernel does know it's being migrated, so we could
actually update the mask, but I'm not sure if that's really feasible.

We already get told by firmware that we're running in "p8 compat" mode,
because we have to pretend to userspace that it's running on a P8. So we
could use that as a signal to leave things alone.

But my understanding is most LPARs don't get migrated back and forth,
they'll start life on a P8 and only get migrated to a P9 once when the
customer gets a P9. They might then run for a long time (months to
years) on the P9 in P8 compat mode, not because they ever want to
migrate back to a real P8, but because the software in the LPAR is still
expecting to be on a P8.

I'm not a real expert on all the Enterprisey stuff though, so someone
else might be able to give us a better picture.

But the point of mentioning the migration stuff was mainly just to
explain why we feel we need to present SMT8 to userspace even on P9.

cheers
