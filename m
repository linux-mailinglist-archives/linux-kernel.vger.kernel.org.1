Good Day,

I am Dr.Per Lessen and I work as a financial consultant with
Global Asset Management company LLC and some High Net worth
individuals from the MENA region and European Union .

Basically, my principals are interested in investing in projects that
are viable and has capacity of generating a reasonable ROI for the
investor.

I MUST consider you a privileged entity who shall be privy to many
sourcable CLEAN fund meant for foreign investment and you are able to
access up to One Billion Euro or More.

I will wish that you send a copy of your highlighted projects with a
elucidated BUSINESS PLANS and EXECUTIVE SUMMARY which I shall propagate
for its immediate approval for a minimal ROI return on investment which
you shall have sole mandate.


You should also bear in mind that funding of this nature is not
completed on email communication alone, there will be the need for a
face to face meeting with the investor or His representatives and have
the paperwork perfected and signed.

kindly reply as soon as possible if you have any viable project that you
will want us to be involved as indicated above.

Thanks

Dr. Per Lessen
