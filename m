OK, sounds good.  I think it's still good practice to include both the
SoC specific and the generic.  Even if the driver never does anything
with the SoC-specific compatible string it doesn't hurt to have it
there.  Thus, we'd want:

compatible = "qcom,msm8996-qfprom", "qcom,qfprom"

The driver itself would never need to refer to the SoC-specific name
but that does give us more flexibility.

Sure, this is OK with me then.  Originally Ravi had 3 ranges but then
he was (in the driver) treating it as one range.  As long as the
driver truly treats it as 3 ranges I have no problem doing it like
this.

In general, over the years, there has been a push to keep
implementation details out of the dts and rely more on the "of_match"
table to add SoC-specific details.  This becomes really important when
1 year down the road you realize that you need one more random
property or address range to fix some bug and then you need to figure
out how to try to keep old "dts" files compatible.  It's not a
hard-and-fast rule, though.

I'd up to you (and Rob H, who probably will wait for the next rev of
the binding before chiming in) but the "qcom,fuse-blow-frequency" is
the type of property that feels better in the driver and achieved from
the of_match table.  Then you don't need to worry about adding it to
the bindings.  Voltage (if needed) would be similar, but I would hope
we don't need it.

Sounds sane to me.
