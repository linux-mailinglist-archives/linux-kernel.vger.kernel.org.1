Well no "device" exported it, we did mostly automatically using only DT
information. When making a DT I don't want to be thinking about how
names will break userspace, for instance if node naming guidance is
updated do apps suddenly stop working? That worries me a bit.

Oh I agree here, net interface names and /dev/<hd> names have a history
of changing, but those did both break a lot of apps. It could be argued
they were abusing the API by making assumptions about the names, but we
still have old scripts floating assuming "eth0" is going to just work..

So the sooner we get this fstab scheme in place and in practice, the
fewer apps in the wild will hard-code names.

Sure, so this "fstab" style config will have to be a mapping of names
(which we will have to make static per heap in kernel) to properties
that interest the current users of a system. For now I can only think of
cached/uncached, contiguous/sg, and secure/mappable. Then maybe a list
of devices that can consume buffers of that variety, should allow for
simple constraint matching. I'll need to think on this a bit more as the
use-cases show up..
