Nice, will fix.

How do I use the defines from include/dt-bindings then? Or should I just
use the numeric values then, like:

  idt,mode:
    description:
      The output drive mode. Values defined in
      dt-bindings/clk/versaclock.h
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 6

?

Ok.

No, what I wanted to mean is that allowed cases are:
 * for idt,5p49v5933 and idt,5p49v5935:
   - only 'xin' (required)
 * for the other parts one of these:
   - only 'xin'
   - only 'clkin'
   - both 'xin' and 'clkin'

How do I express that?


A general note: as a newcomer to yaml bindings I found a steep learning
curve. Finding a correct construct (not to mention the best one) for
each situation is time consuming and frustrating. I've been looking at
existing files for suitable examples but it doesn't work very well.

Is there any guide to yaml bindings for beginners with examples of
typical cases? It would greatly help in producing better patches and
saving time for everybody.

Thanks,
