Yes, but this is a fundamental problem with the commit on close
model that the configfs binary attributes implement, and we have to
work around that somehow.  The current behavior is to entirely ignore
errors, which of course has major issues.  I guess the alternative might
be to just commit on every ->flush as the use case (and yes I know
people could abuse it) for the configfs files is a set of simple
write syscalls.  Then again the above might be better than that.

Lenny, can you look ingo that?
