Ah, interesting.  I didn't think about this case exactly.  I might
have a fix for it anyway.  At some point in time I was thinking that
the world could be solved by relying on lazily-disabled interrupts and
I wrote up a patch to make sure that they woke things up.  If you're
willing to check out our gerrit you can look at:

https://crrev.com/c/2314693

...if not I can post it as a RFC for you.  I'm sure I've solved the
problem in a completely incorrect and broken way, but hopefully the
idea makes sense.  In discussion we decided not to go this way because
it looked like IRQ clients could request an IRQ with
IRQ_DISABLE_UNLAZY and then that'd break us.  :(  ...but even so I
think the patch is roughly right and would address your point #1.

Right, the problem is #2.  We're not in the lazy mode.
