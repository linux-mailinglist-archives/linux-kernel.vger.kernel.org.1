Ick, no!  NEVER rebase a public branch.  Why does it matter the speed of
my branch vs. anyone elses?  Git handles merges very well.

Just like Linus's branches move much faster than mine, and I don't
rebase my branches, you shouldn't rebase yours.

Becides, I'm only taking _PATCHES_ for fpga changes at the moment, no
git pulls, so why does it matter at all for any of this?

What is the problem you are trying to solve here?
