The patch looks great, thanks. To that extent you can add my ack:

Acked-by: Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>

One concern about the API now exposed, though: to a new cgroup v2 user this 
looks fairly dodgy as a sole stat file (except for cgroup.stat) at the root. If 
I used cgroup v2 for the first time and only saw memory.stat and cgroup.stat 
there, but for some reason io.stat and cpu.stat are not available at the root 
but are available everywhere else, I think my first thought would be that the 
cgroup v2 developers must have been on some strong stuff when they came up with 
this ;-)

Even if they're only really duplicating information available elsewhere right 
now, have you considered exposing the rest of the stat files as well so that 
the API maintains a bit more consistency? As a bonus, that also means userspace 
applications can parse in the same way from the root down.
