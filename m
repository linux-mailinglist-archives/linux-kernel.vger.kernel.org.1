Each VM has a shared buffer for I/O requests passing with the
hypervisor. Currently, the hypervisor doesn't indicate the VMs which has
pending I/O requests. So when kernel get the notification interrupt, it
search all VMs' shared buffer and dispatch the pending I/O requests.

The current I/O requests dispatching implementation uses one global
tasklet (be scheduled in the hypervisor notification interrupt), so it
needs to iterate all VMs to do the dispatching.

Each VM has a dedicated hypervisor notification interrupt vector might
be suited (a vector can be linked with a VM). The disadvantage is that
it might occupy many vectors.

Looking forward to more suggestions. Thanks very much.

That will be great. :)
