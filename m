Hi Eric,

oh, sorry for that, that was requested in the peer review, I could not
get a patch approved that does not have such a boolean, that simplified
the error handling.

Actually I had sent you an e-mail with that patch 24H before I posted
the update, then Greg asked me to re-post the whole series, that
took at least another two days, so at that time I was seriously
concerned how you are doing, since I head nothing from you about the
updated patch with the exec_mmap_called.

Linus that is not the boolean I was talking in the other mail.
That boolean is called unsafe_execve_in_progres.

So, and now I also try to get some sleep....


Thanks
Bernd.
