That was exactly my plan.

I wrote this text precisely because I intended to support using other
tokens to specify other situations, such as failure :).

As a note, the GCC project has a GSoC project approved for this summer,
for GCC and/or binutils to participate in the jobserver protocol when
they do multithreading in the compiler/linker.  I think they are
planning on creating a generic "jobserver library" but I'm not
mentoring (I don't have the bandwidth for GSoC mentoring).  I do hope
to stay abreast of their work and perhaps toss in suggestions however.

Yes, I believe I have an enhancement in Savannah about this.

That's necessary, but my thinking is that more could be done.  What I
was going to do was if we write back an error token then we would also
go into a loop trying to read all the tokens off the jobserver and
write back error tokens, until we read an error token, then we'd exit
(after writing it back obviously).

If you don't do that you'll have to go through an entire set of builds
after the failure before everyone notices the failure.  If every
instance of make does this then you can propogate the error to everyone
more quickly.

My current work on GNU make is fixing the atrocious mess it has with
signal handling: don't even look and if you do, remember I inherited
this code (yeah, yeah, a long time ago but still... :)).  Right now
it's not so hard (especially with large -j) to have make instances
hanging when ^C is used due to race conditions in the signal handling.

As with all single-threaded applications, though, the problem is the
difficulty (in a portable way) of handling both signals and wait*(2)
reliably...

Anyway, this shouldn't be too difficult.
