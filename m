Hi,

Ingo and I talked about this thing this morning and tglx has had it on
his to-fix list too so here's a first attempt at it.

Below is just a brain dump of what we talked about so let's start with
it and see where it would take us.

Thx.

From: Borislav Petkov <bp@suse.de>

... without any exception handling and tracing.

If an exception needs to be handled while reading an MSR - which is in
most of the cases caused by a #GP on a non-existent MSR - then this
is most likely the incarnation of a BIOS or a hardware bug. Such bug
violates the architectural guarantee that MSR banks are present with all
MSRs belonging to them.

The proper fix belongs in the hardware/firmware - not in the kernel.

Handling exceptions while in #MC and while an NMI is being handled would
cause the nasty NMI nesting issue because of the shortcoming of IRET
of reenabling NMIs when executed. And the machine is in an #MC context
already so <Deity> be at its side.

Tracing MSR accesses while in #MC is another no-no due to tracing being
inherently a bad idea in atomic context:

  vmlinux.o: warning: objtool: do_machine_check()+0x4a: call to mce_rdmsrl() leaves .noinstr.text section

so remove all that "additional" functionality from mce_rdmsrl() and
concentrate on solely reading the MSRs.
