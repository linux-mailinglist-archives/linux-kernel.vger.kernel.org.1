Looks like we got at least one concrete example now in [1].

But it doesn't really ignore consumer requests though. In response to
all your comments above, I haven't done a good job of explaining the
issues and the solution. I'll try to redo that part again when I send
v3 and hopefully I can do better.

Ok. Thinking more about it, when I try to add voltage handling, I'll
need to call regulator_get_voltage_rdev(). So I might still need to
wait till supply is set up. However, if I don't really need it, I'll
make sure to drop any "future improvements" related changes.

I wouldn't call it delaying any requests. This is just an additional
constraint like any other consumer. This definitely makes things more
stable in cases where all the devices probe and even in cases where
some of those devices might never probe (example I gave in [2]).

Agreed. Which is why the timeout will be enabled by default and the
default behavior won't change. And I'm not making or asking for DT
changes. So it shouldn't break existing users.

MFDs are just one example. In any case, we can stick with how I did it
in v2 where the regulator framework can set up the sync_state()
callback for the driver if it hasn't already set one up.

This is definitely not true on real Android phones. Keep in mind all
of this only applies to resources actually left on by the bootloader.
So, that drastically cuts down what all devices are affected by this.
So, if a PMIC has 5 regulators and only 1 is left on by the
bootloader, then this patch series would be a NOP for the 4
regulators.

That's definitely not the case. sync_state() callbacks will come way
before all the modules are loaded. Again, going by testing it on real
hardware.
