/me looks at the .s file...

options passed comment at the top has -fno-omit-frame-pointer

Yes, start_secondary() is the function which is marked as
__attribute__((optimize("-fno-stack-protector"))) and it does:

# arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:264:        local_irq_enable();
        call    trace_hardirqs_on       #

(the local_irq_enable() is a macro which has the call to
trace_hardirqs_on().

Here's the preamble:

        .text
        .p2align 4
        .type   start_secondary, @function
start_secondary:
        pushl   %esi    #
        pushl   %ebx    #
        subl    $28, %esp       #,
# arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:226:        cr4_init();
        call    cr4_init        #
	...

Those two pushes on entry are for callee-saved regs, AFAICT, because it
is going to use them later. But no frame setup.

Looks like it. And that's 32-bit. 64-bit variant of this looks more like it:

        .text
        .p2align 4
        .type   start_secondary, @function
start_secondary:
        pushq   %rbp    #
        subq    $8, %rsp        #,

although it doesn't save %rsp on the stack. I think it leaves space on
the stack for the canary but I'm not sure.

Yap, see above.

Ok, I'll find you on IRC to talk details.

Thx.
