To some extent, but not entirely. Depending on the governor / workload,
some OPPs might never be used at all.

The only really reliable test we've had so far is the one I pointed out,
so please run it on one board at least

It's not really my point :)

My point is that since it's in the DTSI, every board using an H2/H3 will
now get to use those OPPs, even if they don't have the regulator support
and the voltage set for the highest frequency, so you can end up on
those boards with the CPU running at 1.2GHz and the voltage associated
to 1GHz
