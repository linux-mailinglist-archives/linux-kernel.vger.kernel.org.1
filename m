Add Sphinx reference links to HMM and CPUSETS, and numerous small
editorial changes to make the page_migration.rst document more readable.

The patch applies cleanly to the latest linux or linux-mm tree.
Since this is MM relatated, perhaps Andrew Morton would like to
take this into the linux-mm tree.

Changes in v2:
Applied suggestions from Randy Dunlap:
Replace outdated ftp:// link to https://github
Changed "off node" to "off-node" and "non-lru" to "non-LRU"
