Well, if (for example) we look at
"linux-next test error: WARNING: suspicious RCU usage in ovs_ct_exit"
(https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/000000000000e642a905a0cbee6e@google.com/),
it was sent to the maintainers of net/openvswitch/ where the warning occurred.
It was then ignored.

Would it help if bugs blocking testing on linux-next were Cc'ed to
linux-next@vger.kernel.org, so that Stephen could investigate?

FWIW, the issue of "syzbot report sent and ignored for months/years" is actually
a much broader one which applies to all bugs, not just build / test breakages.
There are tons of open bugs on https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream which are
definitely still valid (sort by "Last" occurred).  Long-term, to fix this we
really need syzbot to start sending reminders.  But first there's work needed to
make the noise level low enough so that people don't just tune them out.
