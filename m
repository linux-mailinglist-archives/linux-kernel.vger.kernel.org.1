Subject: [PATCH v4 4/5] soc: qcom: rpmh-rsc: Simplify locking by eliminating the per-TCS lock

The rpmh-rsc code had both a driver-level lock (sometimes referred to
in comments as drv->lock) and a lock per-TCS.  The idea was supposed
to be that there would be times where you could get by with just
locking a TCS lock and therefor other RPMH users wouldn't be blocked.

The above didn't work out so well.

Looking at tcs_write() the bigger drv->lock was held for most of the
function anyway.  Only the __tcs_buffer_write() and
__tcs_set_trigger() calls were called without it the drv->lock.  It
actually turns out that in tcs_write() we don't need to hold the
drv->lock for those function calls anyway even if the per-TCS lock
isn't there anymore.  Thus, from a tcs_write() point of view, the
per-TCS lock was useless.

Looking at rpmh_rsc_write_ctrl_data(), only the per-TCS lock was held.
It turns out, though, that this function already needs to be called
with the equivalent of the drv->lock held anyway (we either need to
hold drv->lock as we will in a future patch or we need to know no
other CPUs could be running as happens today).  Specifically
rpmh_rsc_write_ctrl_data() might be writing to a TCS that has been
borrowed for writing an active transation but it never checks this.

Let's eliminate this extra overhead and avoid possible AB BA locking
headaches.
