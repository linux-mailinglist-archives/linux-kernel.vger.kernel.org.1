Yeah sorry I overlooked that case and was thinking of it being invoked
from driver!

Yes this would make the snd_compr_stop() behave incorrectly.. so this
cant be done as proposed.

But we still need to set the draining stream state properly and I am
thinking below now:

diff --git a/sound/core/compress_offload.c b/sound/core/compress_offload.c
index 509290f2efa8..9aba851732d7 100644
--- a/sound/core/compress_offload.c
+++ b/sound/core/compress_offload.c
@@ -929,7 +929,9 @@ static int snd_compr_partial_drain(struct snd_compr_stream *stream)
        }
 
        stream->next_track = false;
-       return snd_compress_wait_for_drain(stream);
+       retval = snd_compress_wait_for_drain(stream);
+       stream->runtime->state = SNDRV_PCM_STATE_RUNNING;
+       return retval;
 }
