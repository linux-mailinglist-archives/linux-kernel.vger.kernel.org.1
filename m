Making an unfair rwsem that prefer readers (like the original rwlock
semantics) is certainly doable. I don't think that is hard to do. I can
think of 2 possible ways to do that. We=C2=A0 could make the unfairness
globally applies to all the readers of a rwsem by defining the fairness
state at init time. That will require keeping the state in the rwsem
structure increasing its size.

Another alternative is to add new functions like down_read_unfair() that
perform unfair read locking for its callers. That will require less code
change, but the calling functions have to make the right choice.

Cheers,
Longman
