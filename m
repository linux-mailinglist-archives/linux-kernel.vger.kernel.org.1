hm, this won't improve maintainability :(

- Everyone will need to remember when to use PageHighMem() and when
  to use PageHighMemZone().  If they get it wrong, they're unlikely to
  notice any problem in their runtime testing, correct?

- New code will pop up which gets it wrong and nobody will notice for
  a long time.

So I guess we need to be pretty confident that the series "mm/cma:
manage the memory of the CMA area by using the ZONE_MOVABLE" will be
useful and merged before proceeding with this, yes?

On the other hand, this whole series is a no-op until [10/10]
(correct?) so it can be effectively reverted with a single line change,
with later cleanups which revert the other 9 patches.

So I think I'd like to take another look at "mm/cma: manage the memory
of the CMA area by using the ZONE_MOVABLE" before figuring out what to
do here.  Mainly to answer the question "is the new feature valuable
enough to justify the maintainability impact".  So please do take some
care in explaining the end-user benefit when preparing the new version
of that patchset.
