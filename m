Worth noting that while in this case it happens to identify the SoC,
in general you can have distinct instances of system IP in a single
system, so I do think that we need *something* instance-specific, even
if that's combined with SoC info.

Where IP gets reused across SoCs, it makes sense for that to not depend
on top-level SoC info.

Thanks,
Mark.
