So somewhere BUS_MCEERR_AR was mentioned. So I'm assuming the error
severity was "action required". What does happen in the kernel, on
baremetal, with an AR error in kernel space, i.e., kernel memory?

If we can't fixup the exception, we die.

So why should the guest behave any differently?

Now, if you want for the guest to be more "robust" and handle that
thing, fine. But then you'd need an explicit way to tell the guest
kernel: "you've just had an MCE and I unmapped the page" so that the
guest kernel can figure out what do to. Even if it means, to panic.

I.e., signal in an explicit way that EPT violation Jue is talking about
in the other mail.

You can inject a #PF or better yet the *first* MCE which is being
injected should say with a bit somehwere "I unmapped the address in
m->addr". So that the guest kernel can handle that properly and know
what *exactly* it is getting an MCE for.

What I don't like is the "am I running as a guest" check. Because
someone else would come later and say, err, I'm not virtualizing this
portion of MCA either, lemme add another "am I guest" check.

Sure, it is a lot easier but when stuff like that starts spreading
around in the MCE code, then we can just as well disable MCE when
virtualized altogether. It would be a lot easier for everybody.
