I don't really see any other way to solve the priority inversion other
than per-CRTC kthreads.  I've been thinking about it a bit more, and
my conclusion is:

(1) There isn't really any use for the N+1'th commit to start running
before the kthread_work for the N'th commit completes, so I don't mind
losing the unbound aspect of the workqueue approach
(2) For cases where there does need to be serialization between
commits on different CRTCs, since there is a per-CRTC kthread, you
could achieve this with locking

Since i915 isn't using the atomic helpers here, I suppose it is an
option for i915 to just continue doing what it is doing.

And I could ofc just stop using the atomic commit helper and do the
kthreads thing in msm. But my first preference would be that the
commit helper does generally the right thing.
