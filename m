If the number of functions is really large, constraints may be a better
idea.

If the names of the functions are not actually known, constraints may be a
better idea.

If it is desired to collect some statistics about the matching process,
constraints allow that.

If it is desired to reason about values, for example that a constant is
greater or less than some value, then constraints allow that.

If it is desired to avoid changing code in a particular function, then
constraints allow that.

So there are a lot of reasons why constraints are useful.  There are
likely even more.  But hiding information that could be apparent to the
SmPL compiler and could be used to improve the performance of the matching
process is not one of them.
