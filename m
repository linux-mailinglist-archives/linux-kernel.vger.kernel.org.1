The skip bits are safe here, since even it race with other skip action,
It will still skip out. The skip action is try not to compaction too much,
not a exclusive action needs avoid race.

Sorry, I still can not follow you here. Compound code part is unchanged
and follow the original logical. So would you like to pose a new code to
see if its works?
