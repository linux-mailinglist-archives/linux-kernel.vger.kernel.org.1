For some reason this didn't land in my inbox.

Yeah I was considering how we can handle this potential new user without
a clash. But I thought we first need to agree this is indeed the right thing to
do.

The easiest way is to make the new API act on the task struct directly rather
than go through sched_setscheduler(). I.e: a wrapper around uclamp_se_set().

But first, I think we need to consider how accessible we want to keep
sched_setscheduler(). IMO it should be hidden because of its potential
misuse/abuse. Happy to help with that if you agree.

Thanks
