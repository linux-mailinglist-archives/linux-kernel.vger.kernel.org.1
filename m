I agree with Rob on landing what we have in DP driver. Of course, by 
addressing any outstanding comments. That would help in setting base 
functional code for DisplayPort
Bring-up. Other features such as PHY compliance and DP audio are 
dependent on these changes.

We don't want to keep PLL code in drm/msm directory and so we have 
removed bindings of PLL from DP node. Once base driver is merged, we can 
rebase Stephen's QMP PHY changes and merge them. Stephen's changes are 
removing PLL code from drm/msm directory already.

Other dependent patches for DisplayPort driver on msm are posted here:
