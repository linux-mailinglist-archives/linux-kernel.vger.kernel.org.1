Looks good, applied, thank you!  I reworked things a bit based on
previous patches and to more precisely capture why this patch does
not cause additional problems.  Please let me know if I messed
anything up.

							Thanx, Paul

commit 33847a34a2d261354a79b4a24d9d37222e8ec888

    rcu/tree: nocb: Avoid raising softirq for offloaded ready-to-execute CBs
    
    Testing showed that rcu_pending() can return 1 when offloaded callbacks
    are ready to execute.  This invokes RCU core processing, for example,
    by raising RCU_SOFTIRQ, eventually resulting in a call to rcu_core().
    However, rcu_core() explicitly avoids in any way manipulating offloaded
    callbacks, which are instead handled by the rcuog and rcuoc kthreads,
    which work independently of rcu_core().
    
    One exception to this independence is that rcu_core() invokes
    do_nocb_deferred_wakeup(), however, rcu_pending() also checks
    rcu_nocb_need_deferred_wakeup() in order to correctly handle this case,
    invoking rcu_core() when needed.
    
    This commit therefore avoids needlessly invoking RCU core processing
    by checking rcu_segcblist_ready_cbs() only on non-offloaded CPUs.
    This reduces overhead, for example, by reducing softirq activity.
    
    This change passed 30 minute tests of TREE01 through TREE09 each.
    
    On TREE08, there is at most 150us from the time that rcu_pending() chose
    not to invoke RCU core processing to the time when the ready callbacks
    were invoked by the rcuoc kthread.  This provides further evidence that
    there is no need to invoke rcu_core() for offloaded callbacks that are
    ready to invoke.
