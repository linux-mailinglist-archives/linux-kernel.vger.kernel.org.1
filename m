With mainline this isn't a problem; with the core scheduling stuff there is
an expectation that we can use the SMT masks in sched_cpu_starting().

As stated above, it's not a problem for mainline, and AIUI we can change
the core scheduling bits to only use the SMT mask in sched_cpu_activate()
instead, therefore not requiring any change in the arch code.

I'm not aware of any written rule that the topology masks should be usable
from a given hotplug state upwards, only that right now we need them in
sched_cpu_(de)activate() for SMT scheduling - and that is already working
fine.

So really this should be considering as a simple neutral cleanup; I don't
really have any opinion on picking it up or not.
