well, sendto in the end does a copy_from_user or a get_user_pages_fast,
both are covered (once we fix the make_accessible to work on FOLL_GET
too).

I tried your patch, but I could not reproduce the problem. I have a
Debian 10 x86_64 with the latest kernel from master and your patch on
top. is there anything I'm missing? which virtual devices are you using?
any particular .config options?

I could easily get the mm_make_accessible tracepoints, but I never
manage to trigger the mm_accessible_error ones.

are you using transparent hugepages by any chance? the
infrastructure for inaccessible pages is meant only for small pages,
since on s390x only small pages can ever be used for secure
guests and therefore become inaccessible.
