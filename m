Do we have any information on userspace that actually needs this functionality?

Note that we're _not_ talking here about the complete USERPTR
functionality, but rather just the very corner case of carveout memory
not backed by struct pages.

Given that the current in-tree ways of reserving carveout memory, such
as shared-dma-pool, actually give memory backed by struct pages, do we
even have a source of such legacy memory in the kernel today?

I think that given that this is a very niche functionality, we could
have it disabled by default for security reasons and if someone
_really_ (i.e. there is no replacement) needs it, they probably need
to use a custom kernel build anyway for their exotic hardware setup
(with PFN-backed carveout memory), so they can enable it.

Note that USERPTR as a whole generally has been considered deprecated
in V4L2 for many years and people have been actively discouraged to
use it. And, still, we're just talking here about the very rare corner
case, not the whole USERPTR API.
