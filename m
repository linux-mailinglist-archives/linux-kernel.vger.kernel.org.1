Sorry - bad choice of terminology. I was referring to the SMMU
ensuring that it had all its clients shut-down before if shut down. To
quote Sai...

I agree it is unlikely, but if removing the device from the CoreSight
infrastructure via coresight_unregister() is a potential source of a
crash, it would seem that there is a potential path where some
CoreSight driver side work might be possible. therefore a mode to
prevent this crash, and ensure that the device hardware remains off
and not sending trace to SMMU until such time as shutdown / reboot
restart occurs, seemed prudent.
