> * Move low-level enclave management routines, page fault handler and pa=
ge
>   reclaiming routines from driver to the core. These cannot be separate=
d
>   from each other as they are heavily interdependent. The rationale is =
that

> * Allow the driver to be compiled as a module now that it no code is us=
ing

>   essentially just a thin ioctl layer.
> * Reworked the driver to maintain a list of mm_struct's. The VMA callba=
cks
>   add new entries to this list as the process is forked. Each entry has=

>   its own refcount because they have a different life-cycle as the encl=
ave

>   and we allow forking by removing VM_DONTCOPY from vm flags.
> * Generate a cpu mask in the reclaimer from the cpu mask's of all
>   mm_struct's. This will kick out the hardware threads out of the encla=
ve
>   from multiple processes. It is not a local variable because it would
>   eat too much of the stack space but instead a field in struct
>   sgx_encl.
> * Allow forking i.e. remove VM_DONTCOPY. I did not change the API
>   because the old API scaled to the workload that Andy described. The
>   codebase is now mostly API independent i.e. changing the API is a
>   small task. For me the proper trigger to chanage it is a as concrete
>   as possible workload that cannot be fulfilled. I hope you understand
>   my thinking here. I don't want to change anything w/o proper basis
>   but I'm ready to change anything if there is a proper basis. I do
>   not have any kind of attachment to any particular type of API.

>=20
> v13:
> * Always use SGX_CPUID constant instead of a hardcoded value.
> * Simplified and documented the macros and functions for ENCLS leaves.

> * Use PM notifier per enclave so that we don't have to traverse

> * Removed unused SGX_LE_ROLLBACK constant from uapi/asm/sgx.h
> * Always use ioremap() to map EPC banks as we only support 64-bit kerne=

> * Refined sgx_arch.h to include alignment information for every struct =
that

> * Got rid of SGX_CPUID.
> * SGX detection now prints log messages about firmware configuration is=
sues.
>=20
> v11:
> * Polished ENCLS wrappers with refined exception handling.
> * ksgxswapd was not stopped (regression in v5) in
>   sgx_page_cache_teardown(), which causes a leaked kthread after driver=

>   deinitialization.
> * Shutdown sgx_le_proxy when going to suspend because its EPC pages wil=
l be

> * Set EINITTOKEN.VALID to zero for a token that is passed when
>   SGXLEPUBKEYHASH matches MRSIGNER as alloc_page() does not give a zero=

>   page.
> * Fixed the check in sgx_edbgrd() for a TCS page. Allowed to read offse=
ts

le.
> * On read access memcpy() call inside sgx_vma_access() had src and dest=

ls

il.
>   It did not, which caused weird races when trying to change other part=
s of

NVAL

>=20
> v10:

> * Close the anon inode when LE is stopped (regression in v9).

>=20

>=20

> * Fix the race in hash mrsigner calculation between the launch

>=20
> v7:

> * Squeezed struct sgx_encl_page to 32 bytes.
> * Fixed deferencing of an RSA key on OpenSSL 1.1.0.

>=20

> * Removed virtualization chapter from the documentation.
> * Changed the default filename for the signing key as signing_key.pem.

> * Cleaned up ptrace() code.
> * Refined commit messages for new architectural constants.
> * Sorted includes in every source file.
> * Sorted local variable declarations according to the line length in

> * Style fixes based on Darren's comments to sgx_le.c.
>=20

>=20

> * Use unused bits in epc_page->pa to store the bank number.
> * Removed #ifdef for WQ_NONREENTRANT.
> * If mmu_notifier_register() fails with -EINTR, return -ERESTARTSYS.

> * Documented sgx_encl_* functions.
> * Added remark about AES implementation used inside the LE.
> * Removed redundant sgx_sys_exit() from le/main.c.

> * Fixed SSA frame size calculation to take the misc region into account=
=2E
> * Implemented consistent exception handling to __encls() and __encls_re=
t().
> * Implemented a proper device model in order to allow sysfs attributes

> * Cleaned up various "find enclave" implementations to the unified
>   sgx_encl_find().
> * Validate that vm_pgoff is zero.
> * Discard backing pages with shmem_truncate_range() after EADD.
> * Added missing EEXTEND operations to LE signing and launch.
> * Fixed SSA size for GPRS region from 168 to 184 bytes.
> * Fixed the checks for TCS flags. Now DBGOPTIN is allowed.
> * Check that TCS addresses are in ELRANGE and not just page aligned.
> * Require kernel to be compiled with X64_64 and CPU_SUP_INTEL.
> * Fixed an incorrect value for SGX_ATTR_DEBUG from 0x01 to 0x02.
>=20
> v2:
