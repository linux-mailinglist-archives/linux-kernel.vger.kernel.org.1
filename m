Previously, Andrea has described their use case in the cloud environment
to hiberate the guest and swapoff after resuming.  So swapoff
performance is important for them.  I think that should be included.
For the business part, I mean something like "Ubuntu used in AWS EC2", I
think that isn't important for the patch description.
