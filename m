Just to throw in some 2c worth. A nice thing about Namhyung's approach
is that it can apply for metrics, events and pfm-events. It would be
nice if there were a single option for specifying these, perhaps we
can figure one out.

One thought that came to mind based on Namhyung's multiply name was
and assuming a cgroup could be a modifier:

perf record -e cycles:G1

there could be equivalent to a new syntax of lists and multiplies of:

perf record -e [cycles]*[:G1]

This would allow expressions like:

perf record -e [{instructions,cycles},branches]*[:u,:k]

which would be equivalent to (showing the effect on sibling groups):

perf record -e {instructions:u,cycles:u},branches:u,{instructions:k,cycles:k},branches:k

Adding in cgroups makes a longer list of events:

perf record -e [{instructions,cycles},branches]*[:u,:k]*[:G1,:G2]

becomes:

perf record -e {instructions:u:G1,cycles:u:G1},branches:u:G1,{instructions:k:G1,cycles:k:G1},branches:k:G1,{instructions:u:G2,cycles:u:G2},branches:u:G2,{instructions:k:G2,cycles:k:G2},branches:k:G2

This is somewhat similar to Arnaldo's proposal but trying to make
things a bit more generic, avoiding overloading the use of sibling
groups, .. Perhaps there is a syntax that others prefer or could be
borrowed from a familiar source like a programming language.

I think for Namhyung's sake it is important not to get too distracted
by desires for better syntax, as this change makes a benefit in a way
that works with the existing flags. If it is accepted, the man pages
need to be updated.

Thanks,
Ian
