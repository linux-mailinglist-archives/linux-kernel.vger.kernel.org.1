I agree this can go, it looks like I had it here as a sanity check while the KVM bits were
sorted out.

Please also remove the comment that says it does this:
| * Non-RAS SError's are reported as Uncontained/Uncategorized.

This becomes the callers problem.

KVM depends on this, please don't remove it.

What does 'fatal' mean?
To the arch code it means panic(), as we don't (yet) have the information to fix the
error. But to KVM 'fatal' means kill-the-guest. KVM does this as without user-space's
involvement, there is very little else it can do.

KVM can only do this if the error is contained. As it must have been contained by stage2,
so the host can keep running. But if the error was reported as uncontained, KVM would need
to panic() the host.

(An example of an Uncontained error is a store that went to the wrong address due to
corruption that wasn't caught in time. We can't trust any value in memory once we've seen
one of these.)


I agree it looks funny, but it was simpler for the arch code helper to do this, instead of
having an 'arm64_is_uncontained_ras_serror(), as now you'd always have to check three things.
