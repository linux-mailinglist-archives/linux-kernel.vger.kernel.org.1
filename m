Looking more into replicator1(swao_replicator) values as 0x0 even after 
replicator_reset()
in replicator probe, I added dynamic_replicator_reset in 
dynamic_replicator_enable()
and am not seeing any hardlockup. Also I added some prints to check the 
idfilter
values before and after reset and found that its not set to 0xff even 
after replicator_reset()
in replicator probe, I don't see any other path setting it to 0x0.

After probe:

Can we have a replicator_reset in dynamic_replicator_enable?
