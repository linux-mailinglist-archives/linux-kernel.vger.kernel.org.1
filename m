This sounds like it may not actually have finished enabling fully?

If the regulator has been disabled underneath us in a way that means it
won't come back the driver should be reflecting that in the status it
reports.

So it might generate an interrupt but then take a long time to take the
actions associated with the interrupt that allow us to tell what the
interrupt was about?  That doesn't seem great.  Do you know if this code
has ever been exercised, the error handling code appears unusually
involved here?  Normally errors don't routinely occur in production.

Only return IRQ_HANDLED if we actually managed to figure out an error to
report?
