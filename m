Well, support for https was broken at linuxtv.org. Not many media
developers use https instead of git.

The main issue is that we heavily use alternates there, in order
to minimize disk space usage. After some server upgrade, https
stopped working properly.

I just fixed it, by adding some new rewrite rules that will call
git http-backend in order to solve alternates.

Thanks for reporting it.

Yeah, agreed. Sorry for that. 

Not sure what would be the best way to minimize the issues, though.

I mean, I might place those documentation patches on my linux-next
branch, making them visible at tomorrow's linux-next, but that
doesn't sound a good idea, as this will be a source of conflicts,
since several patches from my tree are based on patches applied
via someone's else's tree.

Hopefully, after getting this series merged upstream, the
docs build for html will finally went into a clean state. Any new
warnings that might sleep though maintainer's reviews could
easily be fixed without depending on a 100+ patch series.

-

Btw, there was no new linux-next tag yesterday. The last one is
still next-20201002.

I'll wait for a while a today's linux-next. After rebasing on the
top of that, I'll submit a v5 of this series.

Thanks,
Mauro
