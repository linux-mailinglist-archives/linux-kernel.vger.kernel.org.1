Yes.

Bah, you're right. With removing the one path that Mathieu suggested,
took this player out of the game. Will remove in v2. Thanks for
pointing this out.

Thanks for pointing this out. before_stamp was originally just a normal
variable, but in discussions with Mathieu, it became apparent that it
needed to be atomic as well.

I'll update the change log in v2.

and they are now meaningless, but wasn't in the RFC. I'll remove it.

And I'll remove them.

Thanks for reviewing!
