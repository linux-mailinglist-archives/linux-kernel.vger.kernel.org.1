Hmm. While renaming them, can we perhaps clarify what the rules are?

We now have two different kinds of "unsafe". We have the
"unsafe_get_user()" kind of unsafe: the user pointer itself is unsafe
because it isn't checked, and you need to use a "user_access_begin()"
to verify.

It's the new form of "__get_user()".

And then we have the strncpy_from_user_unsafe(), which is really more
like the "probe_kernel_read()" kind of funtion, in that it's about the
context, and not faulting.

Honestly, I don't like the "unsafe" in the second case, because
there's nothing "unsafe" about the function. It's used in odd
contexts. I guess to some degree those are "unsafe" contexts, but I
think it might be better to clarify.

So while I think using a consistent convention is good, and it's true
that there is a difference in the convention between the two cases
("unsafe" at the beginning vs end), one of them is actually about the
safety and security of the operation (and we have automated logic
these days to verify it on x86), the other has nothing to do with
"safety", really.

Would it be better to standardize around a "probe_xyz()" naming?

Or perhaps a "xyz_nofault()" naming?

I'm not a huge fan of the "probe" naming, but it sure is descriptive,
which is a really good thing.

Another option would be to make it explicitly about _what_ is
"unsafe", ie that it's about not having a process context that can be
faulted in. But "xyz_unsafe_context()" is much too verbose.
"xyz_noctx()" might work.

I realize this is nit-picky, and I think the patch series as-is is
already an improvement, but I do think our naming in this area is
really quite bad.

The fact that we have "probe_kernel_read()" but then
"strncpy_from_user_unsafe()" for the _same_ conceptual difference
really tells me how inconsistent the naming for these kinds of "we
can't take page faults" is. No?
