Right, saying status = "okay" to a node which is missing required
properties (which can only be added by boards when the McASP is
connected up) does not sound a good solution.
How should the SW handle that? Fail the device probe and return with
-EINVAL or eat up the error and just probe with broken configuration.
Since the peripheral is not used, the broken configuration will not
cause much runtime errors as there will be no runtime use of the peripheral.

status of fail or fail-sss is not a good one either, their definition is:
"Indicates that the device is not operational. A serious error was
detected in the device, and it is unlikely to become operational without
repair."

The peripheral is fine, we are just trying to enable it without
providing the needed properties.

status = "disabled" is still the closest thing for everything which have
external dependencies. There is not much point to enable an i2c bus
without making sure that the signals are actually routed to the pins
where they supposed to go.

Or from other pow: a board design is not based on what is _not_
connected to outside world, but you actually _connect_ or _enable_
certain peripherals to external components, connectors.
