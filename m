I think this is where there's a disconnect with what is being requested by the
folks writing run times.  IIUC, they want to use the untrusted runtime's stack
to pass params because it doesn't require additional memory allocations and
automagically grows as necessary (obviously to a certain limit).  I.e. forcing
the caller to provide an alternative "stack" defeats the purpose of using the
untrusted stack.

Heh, I had exactly that typed out, then I reread this paragraph :-)

We do have this confidence, because it's required by the current version
of the VDSO.

But the callback is optional...  It's effectively mandatory if you want to
invoke the vDSO from anything but assembly, but it's not required.

But if these use cases come along (using a modern runtime to run existing
enclaves that do stupid things), and we didn't want to foist the effort of
writing an assembly wrapper onto the runtimes, couldn't we simply add a flag to
opt into saving non-volatile registers and/or loading an alternative RSP?  E.g.

test	$1,	SGX_ENCLAVE_RUN_FLAGS(%rcx)
	jz	.Lload_tsc
	mov	%rsp, SGX_SAVED_RSP(%rbp)
	mov	SGX_ENCLAVE_RUN_RSP(%rcx), %rsp

	/* Load TCS and AEP */
.Lload_tsc:
	mov	SGX_ENCLAVE_RUN_TCS(%rcx), %rbx
	lea	.Lasync_exit_pointer(%rip), %rcx

	/* Single ENCLU serving as both EENTER and AEP (ERESUME) */
.Lasync_exit_pointer:
.Lenclu_eenter_eresume:
	enclu

	/* EEXIT jumps here unless the enclave is doing something fancy. */
	mov	SGX_ENCLAVE_RUN_PTR(%rbp), %rbx
	test	$1, SGX_ENCLAVE_RUN_FLAGS(%rbx)
	jz	.Lblahblahblah

	mov	%rsp, SGX_ENCLAVE_RUN_RSP(%rbx)
	mov	SGX_SAVED_RSP(%rbp), %rsp

.Lblahblahblah:

Hmm, so IIUC, your pie in the sky goal is providing a vDSO that:

  a) is callable from C
  b) supports all existing enclaves
  c) doesn't require a callback

The problem is (c) conflicts the aforementioned desire to use the runtime's 
_stack_, not simply whatever SSA.RSP points at.  We can play games to allow
using the stack as is without a callback, but that would add some non-trivial
nastiness in the caller to avoid clobbering the "enclave's" stack, especially
for runtimes/enclaves that are reentrant.
