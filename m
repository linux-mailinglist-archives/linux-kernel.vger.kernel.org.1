Hi Valtentin,
Thanks for your email. It seems it is quite clear. May I ask what is the real harm
when group 2 is actually out of the span of diameter 2 here? What will happen when group2
doesn't span cpu0_domain1->span?
In domain-1, will scheduler fail to do load balance between group0 and group2?

> [    0.247654]    domain-2: span=0-3 level=NUMA
> [    0.247892]     groups: 0:{ span=0-2 mask=0 cap=3021 }, 3:{ span=1-3
> mask=3 cap=3047 }

Here domain-2 includes all span from 0 to 3, so that means we should still be able to do
load balance in domain-2 between cpu0 and cpu3 even we fail in domain-1?

Your kernel log is:
[    0.246998]   domain-1: span=0-2 level=NUMA
[    0.247145]    groups: 0:{ span=0-1 mask=0 cap=2019 }, 2:{ span=1-3
mask=2 cap=3025 }

it seems group0 should be:
group0: span=0-1, mask=0

but not
group0: span=0-2, mask=0 ?

is it a typo here?

It seems sensible to move span 3 out of the groups of cpu0-domain1.

Again, it seems sensible to move span 0 out of the group of cpu3-domain1.

What is the real harm you have seen in load balance? Have you even tried
to make cpu0,cpu1,cpu2 busy and wake-up more tasks in cpu0? Will cpu3
join to share the loading in your qemu topology?
