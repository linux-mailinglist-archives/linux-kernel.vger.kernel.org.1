Frankly speaking I have not used audio-graph-card before. I had a brief 
look at the related binding. It seems it can use similar DT properties 
that simple-card uses, although the binding style appears to be 
different. However I am not sure if it offers better solutions to the 
problems I am facing. For example, the ability to connect or form a 
chain of components to realize more complicated use cases with DPCM, 
some of which were discussed in [0]. Can you please help me understand 
why it could be preferred?
