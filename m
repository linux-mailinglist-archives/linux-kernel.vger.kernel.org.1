Ah, I went with a slightly looser invariant rule that allows CFI but
ensures they're the same for all alternatives, and the above orig text
has a giant unreachable hole (that we don't report because NOP), I'm
allowing the alternative CFI changes in that.

Maybe that's too much leaway, but I'm thinking it ought to work.

It will probably work just fine, it just feels off to me.

Variable length jump label support, I can't make gnu-as (I so hate that
thing) emit the right instruction at compile-time :/

Yeah, you're right. I'll look for a better place to stick it. Perhaps I
can frob it in validate_branch() somewhere.

And you're also right on the unreachable because of skip_orig thing,
I'll thnk about that.
