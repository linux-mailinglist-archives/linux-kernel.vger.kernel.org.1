From our perspective (and Darrick and I discussed this on this week's
ext4 video conference, so it represents the ext4 and xfs maintainer's
position) is that the file system format is different.  First, the
on-disk format is not an ABI, and it is several orders more complex
than a system call interface.  Second, we make no guarantees about
what the file system created by malicious tools will do.  For example,
XFS developers reject bug reports from file system fuzzers, because
the v5 format has CRC checks, so randomly corrupted file systems won't
crash the kernel.  Yes, this doesn't protect against maliciously
created file systems where the attacker makes sure the checksums are
valid, but only crazy people who think containers are just as secure
as VM's and that unprivileged users should be allowed to make the
kernel mount potentially maliciously created file systems would be
exposing the kernel to such maliciously created images.

Yes.  However...

Just because it won't be modifiable, shouldn't mean that e2fsck won't
check to make sure that such structures are valid.  "Won't be changed"
and "valid" are two different concepts.  And certainly, today we *do*
check to make sure the bitmaps are valid and don't overlap, and we
can't go back in time to change that.

That being said, on the ext4 weekly video chat, we did discuss other
uses of an incompat feature flag that would allow the allocation
bitmap blocks and inode table block fields in the superblock to be
zero, which would mean that they are unallocated.  This would allow us
to dynamically grow the inode table by adding an extra block group
descriptor.  In fact, I'd probably use this as an opportunity to make
some other changes, such using inodes to store locations of the block
group descriptors, inode tables, and allocation bitmaps at the same
time.  Those details can be discussed later, but the point is that
this is why it's good to discuss format changes from a requirements
perspective, so that if we do need to make an incompat change, we can
kill multiple birds with a single stone.

Ah, so you want to be able to let the other side "look at" the file
system in parallel with it being generated on demand?  The cache
coherency problems would seem to be... huge.  For example, how can you
add a file to directory after the reader has looked at the directory
inode and directory blocks?  Or for that matter, looked at a portion
of the inode table block?  Or are you using 4k inodes so there is only
one inode per block?  What about the fact that we sometimes do
readahead of inode table blocks?

I can think of all sorts of implementation level changes in terms of
caching, readahead behavior, etc., that we might make in the future
that might break you if you are doing some quite as outré are that.
Again, the fact that you're being cagey about what you are doing, and
potentially complaining about changes we might make that would break
you, is ***really*** scaring me now.

Can you go into more details here?  I'm sorry if you're working for
some startup who might want to patent these ideas, but if you want to
guarantee future compatibility, I'm really going to have to insist.
