I won't be adding this API. Mainly because I can't argue for it personally as
I'm still not convinced it's a valid way of handling RT default boosting
behavior from within the kernel. But it's a valid discussion to have if you
want to drive it.

I think this is the best way forward. I'm interesting in hearing what
difficulties you encounter while doing this work.

Regarding the patch [1], I need to tweak the way it is implemented and send v6,
but there are no objection to the idea and interface, so hopefully once I send
v6 it'd be accepted.

Thanks
