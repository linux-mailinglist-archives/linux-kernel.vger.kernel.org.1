[ There is GCC 4.9.4, no one should use an older 4.9. ]

I mentioned 5 for a reason: the whole function this patch is to did not
exist before then!  That does not mean the bug existed or did not exist
before GCC 5, but it does for example mean that a backport to 4.9 or
older isn't trivial at all.

Some distros have a GCC 4.8 as system compiler.  We allow building GCC
itself with a compiler that far back, for various reasons as well (and
this is very sharp already, the last mainline GCC 4.8 release is from
June 2015, not all that long ago at all).

But, one reason this works is because people actually test it.  Does
anyone actually test the kernel with old compilers?  It isn't hard to
build a new compiler (because we make sure building a newer compiler
works with older compilers, etc. :-) ), and as you say, most distros
have newer compilers available nowadays.
