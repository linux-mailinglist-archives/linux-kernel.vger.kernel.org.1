Ack, just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something.

Anyone writing softirq code can starve preemption, so I agree that we
should trust people to know what they're doing.

Yes.  I've tended to assume, rather than prove, that this kind of thing
is negligible -- so I confess I had not attempted to measure these
effects when writing the original code.

That sounds fine.

Probably you won't find a significant difference anyway.
