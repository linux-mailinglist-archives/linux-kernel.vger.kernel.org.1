I was actually thinking of a use case, where, we have a watchdog 
interrupt (which is a SPI), which is used for detecting software hangs
and cause device reset; If that interrupt's current cpu affinity is on a 
core, where interrupts are disabled, we won't be able to serve it; so, 
we need to group that interrupt as an fiq; I was thinking, if its 
feasible to mark that interrupt as pseudo NMI and route it to EL1 as 
irq. However, looks like that is not the semantic of a NMI and we would
need something like pseudo NMI ipi for this.

Thank you for the explanation!
