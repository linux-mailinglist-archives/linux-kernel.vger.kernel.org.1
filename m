Subject: [PATCH v4 00/10] drivers: qcom: rpmh-rsc: Cleanup / add lots of comments
Date:   Mon, 13 Apr 2020 10:04:05 -0700

In order to review Maulik's latest "rpmh_flush for non OSI targets"
patch series I've found myself trying to understand rpmh-rsc better.
To make it easier for others to do this in the future, add a whole lot
of comments / documentation.

As part of this there are a very small number of functional changes.
- We'll get a tiny performance boost by getting rid of the "cmd_cache"
  which I believe was unnecessary.
- We now assume someone else is in charge of exclusivity for
  tcs_invalidate() and have removed a lock in there. As per the
  comments in the patch, this isn't expected to cause problems.
- tcs_is_free() no longer checks hardware state, but we think it
  didn't need to.

These changes touch a lot of code in rpmh-rsc.  Luckily Maulik has
reported that he's tested them and they work fine for him.  They
should be ready to go.

I've tried to structure the patches so that simpler / less
controversial patches are first. Those could certainly land on their
own without later patches. Many of the patches could also be dropped
and the others would still apply if they are controversial.  If you
need help doing this then please yell.

These patches are based on Maulik's v17 series, AKA:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/1586703004-13674-1-git-send-email-mkshah@codeaurora.org

There are still more cleanups that we need to do, but to avoid having
too many patches flying through the air at once we'll do them after
Maulik's v17 and this series lands.

With all that, enjoy.

Changes in v4:
- Add "payload" to end of ("Don't double-check rpmh") patch subject
- Removed extra "make sure" in commit message.

Changes in v3:
- ("...are not for IRQ") is new for v3.
- ("Don't double-check rpmh") replaces ("Warning if tcs_write...")
- Add "TCS" in title (Maulik).
- Adjusted comments for rpmh_rsc_write_ctrl_data().
- Comments for new enable_tcs_irq() function.
- Comments for new rpmh_rsc_cpu_pm_callback() function.
- Extra blank line removed (Maulik).
- IRQ registers aren't in TCS0 (Maulik).
- Kill find_match moves from patch #9 to patch #5 (Maulik).
- Mention in message that I also fixed up kernel-doc stuff.
- Moved comments patch after ("Kill cmd_cache and find_match...").
- One space after a period now (Maulik).
- Plural of TCS fixed to TCSes following Maulik's example.
- Re-added comment in tcs_write() about checking for same address.
- Rebased atop v16 ('Invoke rpmh_flush...') series.
- Replace ("...warn if state mismatch") w/ ("...just check tcs_in_use")
- Replaced ("irqsave()...") + ("...never -EBUSY") w/ ("Caller handles...")
- Rewrote commit message to adjust for patch order.
- __tcs_set_trigger() comments adjusted now that it can set or unset.
- get_tcs_for_msg() documents why it's safe to borrow the wake TCS.
- get_tcs_for_msg() no longer returns -EAGAIN.

Changes in v2:
- Comment tcs_is_free() new for v2; replaces old patch 6.
- Document bug of tcs_write() not handling -EAGAIN.
- Document get_tcs_for_msg() => -EAGAIN only for ACTIVE_ONLY.
- Document locks for updating "tcs_in_use" more.
- Document tcs_is_free() without drv->lock OK for tcs_invalidate().
- Document that rpmh_rsc_send_data() can be an implicit invalidate.
- Document two get_tcs_for_msg() issues if zero-active TCS.
- Fixed documentation of "tcs" param in find_slots().
- Got rid of useless "if (x) continue" at end of for loop.
- More clear that active-only xfers can happen on wake TCS sometimes.
- Now prose in comments instead of struct definitions.
- Pretty ASCII art from Stephen.
- Reword tcs_write() doc a bit.
