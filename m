No problem. Will do.

That was extra-paranoid safety, looking at this one again, that should 
be totally unnecessary.
I think that removing this check entirely would be just fine also 
because.. anyway.. writing to these registers more than once won't do 
any harm, nor break functionality: I mean, even if it happens for 
whatever reason, there's *no real need* to avoid it from the hw perspective.

A switch statement looked like being a bit "too much" for just two cases 
where vreg->type cannot be anything else but QCOM_LAB_TYPE or 
QCOM_IBB_TYPE... but okay, let's write a switch statement in place of that.

Yeah, I'm definitely sure.

My bad, I forgot to clean this one up before sending.

...And I even wrote a comment saying "The Short Circuit interrupt is 
critical: fail if not found"!!! Whoa! That was bad.
Yeah, I'm definitely moving that to the appropriate place.
