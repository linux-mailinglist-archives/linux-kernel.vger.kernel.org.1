We talked sometimes on having a dedicated ML, but for one reason or the other,
and as we don't have a lot of volume, we didn't set up (could be an option).

Another thing that we can do (although this is specific for you and doesn't
solve the problem with people like you that are interested on this), is add you
as a reviewer in the MAINTAINERS file. The CrOS EC has a lot of subtleties, and
having more ChromeOS people involved in the reviewing upstream is more than welcome.

Regards,
Enric
