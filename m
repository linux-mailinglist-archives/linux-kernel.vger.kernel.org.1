I have applied the patch for fixes, thanks for testing!

Christoph, when it comes to the check of
"spi->master->dev.parent->dma_mask", I am keeping it for now. I am
simply not sure that all spi masters assign the pointer (even if most
are platform drivers). I think it's better that we remove that check
in a separate patch - to get it tested.

Kind regards
Uffe
