The discussion is whether regions marked as E820_RESERVED should be
considered as RAM or not.

For the hardware that cannot tolerate acceses to these areas like HPE
UV, it should not :)

I still think that keeping them only in memblock.reserved creates more
problems than it solves, but simply adding E820_RESERVED areas to
memblock.memory just won't work.

I'll try to come up with something better Really Soon (c).
