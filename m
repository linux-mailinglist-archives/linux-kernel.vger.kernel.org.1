This brings me back to my earlier question: if there are no PLT entries in
the module, then count_plts() will not find any R_AARCH64_JUMP26 or
R_AARCH64_CALL26 relocations that require PLTs and will therefore return 0.
The absence of these relocations means that module_emit_plt_entry() will not
be called by apply_relocate_add(), and so your patch should have no effect.

You seem to be saying that module_emit_plt_entry() _is_ being called,
despite count_plts() returning 0. One way that can happen is if PLTs are
needed for branches within a single, very large text section, but you also
say that's not the case.

So I think we need more information from you so that we can either reproduce
this ourselves, or better understand where things are going wrong.

Finally, you said that your kernel is "5.6.0-rc3+". Are you able to
reproduce with mainline (5.8-rc4)?

Will

P.S. whenever you reply, the mail threading breaks :(
