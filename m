Maybe I should introduce about the role of the spi-avmm in the system.
Usually it is used in a SPI slave chip which integrates an Avalon Memory
Mapped bus (Avmm bus) and several sub devices. Like the following
diagram:

In order for the host to access the sub device's register space, the
spi-avmm IP is needed to receive the formatted byte stream from host,
convert them to internal Avmm RW, and send back results to host.

We need to follow the 3 layers protocol for register accessing. On SPI
slave side, spi-avmm HW finishes the whole protocol encoding/decoding
work. But on host side, no dedicated IP block is designed. So host need
to handle all the protocol work by SW. This introduces the complexity of
the driver.
We don't introduce any extra software layers, just follows the
definition of 3 layers in HW spec. But I know reviewing the detail of the
protocol is tedious. Maybe I should put more comments about what part of
SPEC should be referenced for some piece of code. Hope this makes the
review work easier.

This spi-avmm IP is not dedicated to the intel Max10 bmc. It is a soft IP
provided in Altera (now Intel) IP library. It could be implemented on
FPGA/CPLDs according to designers need. Actually Max10 is the CPLD chip which
is programed to have this IP on it.
I think it may be good to implement the regmap to support any SPI chips with
this IP.

Another thing is, the Max10 could integrate some sub devices (soft IPs) which
are already supported by platform drivers. Using the regmap could make
the sub devices supported by these drivers in a generic way, just like the way
we do in recent spi-altera patchset.

I see. So should I change something here? I see the same case for other
regmap options.

Yes I'll add the table of definitions of these chars referenced in HW
spec.

I tried to use max(), but seems it can only be used within a function.
We intend to use the macro in struct definition:

  struct spi_avmm_bridge {
          ...
          char trans_buf[TRANS_BUF_SIZE];
          char phy_buf[PHY_BUF_SIZE];
  };

It will cause the compile error with max().

I have caculated and allocated 2 buffers that are large enough to
contain any possible data stream for regmap_bus.max_raw_read/write. See
the definition of TRANS_BUF_SIZE & PHY_BUF_SIZE.

So maybe we don't have to check the length?

Actually this is to fix issue found on systems with Realtime kernel
patchset. In the system you may be scheduled out for enough long time as
long as the higher priority tasks keep running. In that case the slightly
longer timeout didn't work. The number of times delay is not a good
solution either. So I still want to keep the last_try machanism. But
I'll try my best to rewrite this to make it clear when it terminates.

OK. I'll try to refactor the code and remove unnecessary function calls,
only keep the functions that represents the steps clearly defined in HW
spec, and add some comments about what part of spec they are referenced.

OK, I'll reconsider the do_reg_access definition. Cast to u16 here seems
a little confusing.

I'm not sure if it is good that the spi_avmm_regmap_init changes the
configuration of spi devices silently.
In my current implementation, the spi device driver should be aware and
choose the right spi setup before trying to init the regmap. Would it be
too hard for other drivers to use it?

I see. We implemented the byte stream callbacks because we need to
support incremental register read/write mode. I'll remove the
reg_write/read callbacks.
