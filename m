Hrm, that wouldn't work so well for us for eMMC.  I don't think I'm
going to manage to convince folks that we need an initrd just for
this.  I'm probably being naive and I haven't looked at the code, but
it does seem a little weird that this isn't the kind of thing that
could just be tweaked for transfers going forward...

I'll at least attend.  We'll see how useful my contributions are
since, as per usual, I'm wandering into an area I'm not an expert in
here.  ;-)
