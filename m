We generally don't make use of IMP-DEF featurees because of all the pain
it brings. 

Looking at the Cortex-A76 TRM, the encoding for AMCNTENCLR is:

 Op0: 3  (0b11)
 Op1: 3  (0b011)
 CRn: 15 (0b1111)
 CRm: 9  (0b1001)
 Op2: 7  (0b111)

... whereas the architected encoding (from our sysreg.h) is:

 Op0: 3
 Op1: 3
 CRn: 13
 CRm: 2
 Op2: 4

... so that's a different register with the same name, which is
confusing and unfortunate.

The encodings are different (and I haven't checked whether the fields /
semantics are the same), so it's not just a matter of wiring up new
detection code. There are also IMP-DEF traps in ACTLR_EL3 and ACTLR_EL2
which we can't be certain of the configuration of, and as the registers
are in the IMP-DEF encoding space they'll be trapped by HCR_EL2.TIDCP
and emulated as UNDEFINED by a hypervisor. All of that means that going
by the MIDR alone is not sufficient to know we can safely access the
registers.

So as usual for IMP-DEF stuff I don't think we can or should make use of
this.

Thanks,
Mark.
