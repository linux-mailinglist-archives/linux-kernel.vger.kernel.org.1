I don't think this will get us anywhere. If anything this will require
introducing code outside KCOV, and I think that makes the whole
situation even worse. My guess is also we can't even read per-CPU
data, but Peter would have to comment on this.

It's everywhere. We cannot mark noinstr functions to not be
instrumented by KCOV/-fsanitize-coverage, because no compiler provides
an attribute to do so. GCC doesn't have
__attribute__((no_sanitize_coverage)) and Clang doesn't have
__attribute__((no_sanitize("coverage")), and therefore we can't have
__no_sanitize_coverage.

My plan would be to now go and implement the attributes, at the very
least in Clang. Then what we can do is make wihin_noinstr_section a
noop (just return false) if we have CONFIG_CC_HAS_NOSANITIZE_COVERAGE
or something.

Unfortunately, without this patch, we won't have a reliable kernel
with KCOV until we get compiler support.

The thing is that this slowdown is temporary if we add the attributes
to the compiler.
