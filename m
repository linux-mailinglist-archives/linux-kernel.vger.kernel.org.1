Commit eef1a429f234 ("mm/swap.c: piggyback lru_add_drain_all() calls")
implemented an optimization mechanism to exit the to-be-started LRU
drain operation (name it A) if another drain operation *started and
finished* while (A) was blocked on the LRU draining mutex.

This was done through a seqcount latch, which is an abuse of its
semantics:

  1. Seqcount latching should be used for the purpose of switching
     between two storage places with sequence protection to allow
     interruptible, preemptible writer sections. The optimization
     mechanism has absolutely nothing to do with that.

  2. The used raw_write_seqcount_latch() has two smp write memory
     barriers to always insure one consistent storage place out of the
     two storage places available. This extra smp_wmb() is redundant for
     the optimization use case.

Beside the API abuse, the semantics of a latch sequence counter was
force fitted into the optimization. What was actually meant is to track
generations of LRU draining operations, where "current lru draining
generation = x" implies that all generations 0 < n <= x are already
*scheduled* for draining.

Remove the conceptually-inappropriate seqcount latch usage and manually
implement the optimization using a counter and SMP memory barriers.
