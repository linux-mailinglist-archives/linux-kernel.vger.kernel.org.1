Thanks - let's give the Realtek engineers some time to review, too:

* Driver naming - new [rtk-]dhc (Stanley) vs. in-tree rtd1195 elsewhere.

* My other driver was previously reading u32-sized registers directly, 
whereas here I switched to byte-sized reads based on other in-tree nvmem 
drivers. Downstream driver seems inconsistent wrt .word_size:
https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M4-bsp/blob/master/linux-rtk/drivers/nvmem/rtk-efuse.c#L191

* RTD1619 (RTD1319, too?) may need special handling and therefore its 
own DT compatible: There's a magic OTP_CTRL register write downstream 
that I am lacking documentation w/ names&explanations and use case for.
https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M4-bsp/blob/master/linux-rtk/drivers/nvmem/rtk-efuse.c#L216
That might obviously affect the binding, too, requiring oneOf - could be 
changed in a later step though.

I would take the .dts patches through my linux-realtek.git once the 
binding is approved.

* The downstream DTs have nvmem-cells and nvmem-cell-names properties in 
the efuse node directly, which I regarded as unnecessary from reading 
the consumer binding, placing those properties into the consuming node.

* Downstream DTs have more eFuse fields declared than the one I use in 
this series [1]; they are also inconsistent in prefixing them efuse_ vs. 
otp_; in the RTD1295 datasheet the block is called eFuse, so I used 
efuse_ for consistency. I have enforced the dashes convention for nodes,
as I didn't see the node name get used anywhere.

This line addition will conflict with the next line, added earlier in 
this patchset. Same for the binding patch. Do you need a v3 reordering 
them? This driver seems easier to target for 5.9 than the rest of the 
series.

If you do not intend to take the dt-bindings patch (17/29) through your 
tree, I can queue it once ack'ed by Rob and you.

Thanks for the quick review,

Andreas
