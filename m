This is missing the Documentation/ Cc's, did you run scripts/get_maintainer.pl? I'm
adding linux-doc and Jonathan Corbet, for now at least. And I'll refrain from
trimming the reply.

This doesn't explain what's going on with the new combined counter
behavior. See the proposal below.

Shouldn't that be THP_MIGRATION_FAIL, in order to match the existing naming
scheme here?

I would like to propose the following instead of the above. It's rewritten
so as to add explanations for the new behavior, remove the redundancy (the last
sentence in particular is a justification, and belongs in a commit log if anywhere,
not in the doc itself), fix a few typos, use the full 80 columns, and clarify a
bit as well. It uses the new THP_MIGRATION_FAIL name:


Monitoring Migration
=====================

The following events (counters) can be used to monitor page migration.

1. PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS: Normal page migration success. Each count means that a
    page was migrated. If the page was a non-THP page, then this counter is
    increased by one. If the page was a THP, then this counter is increased by
    the number of THP subpages. For example, migration of a single 2MB THP that
    has 4KB-size base pages (subpages) will cause this counter to increase by
    512.

2. PGMIGRATE_FAIL: Normal page migration failure. Same counting rules as for
    _SUCCESS, above: this will be increased by the number of subpages, if it was
    a THP.

3. THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS: A THP was migrated without being split.

4. THP_MIGRATION_FAIL: A THP could not be migrated at all, even after being
    split.

5. THP_MIGRATION_SPLIT: A THP was migrated, but not as such: first, the THP had
    to be split. After splitting, a migration retry was used for the sub-pages,
    and that retry succeeded.

THP_MIGRATION_* events also update the appropriate PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS or
PGMIGRATE_FAILURE events. For example, a THP migration failure will cause both
THP_MIGRATION_FAIL and PGMIGRATE_FAIL to increase.

As mentioned in the other thread, those "ifs" should be removed. I think you
can also get away with removing the two pre-existing "ifs" in the same
patch, too, just to keep the whole set consistent and more readable.
