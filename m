flush/inv the whole thing could be a useful first step, or at least I
can think of some uses for it.  But if it isn't useful for how vk sees
the world, then maybe we should just implement the range properly from
the get-go.  (And I *think* requiring the range to be aligned to
cacheline boundaries.. it is always easy from a kernel uabi PoV to
loosen restrictions later, than the other way around.)
