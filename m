Isn't "where the dependencies are known to the driver core" this a big caveat?

Until driver core knows about 100% of the dependencies, we still need
to do some kind of dpm_list reordering to have correct ordering. Even
with fw_devlink=on, I'd imagine it'd be difficult to achieve 100%
dependency being known to driver core.

No, this patch is not adding any new issues to deferred probe. It just
increases the probability of reproducing the issue. That's exactly why
I wrote the commit text for this patch without the fwnode batch
processing example. Even if you revert the patch, suspend/resume
ordering is broken if deferred probe happens.

I already have a patch to avoid deferred probe during batch fwnode
parsing. I'm trying to do a few more tests before I send it out. So,
it'd be nice if we don't revert it right now and give me some time to
finish testing.
