I've had a random lockup on a pre-rc1 kernel.
But that might be one of our own drivers - OTOH they 'normally'
generate OOPS tracebacks.

Have you tried setting up a serial console?
It might contain some useful messages.

Sysrq is more likely to work with a PS2 keyboard (not USB).
IIRC the 'caps lock' light only needs PS2 keyboard interrupts
to be working - a useful check on how dead a system it.
