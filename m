I had missed the Documention/ Cc's, thanks for adding them here. Will
update the Cc list next time around.

Sure, will change it.

The last part might not be true. All that THP_MIGRATION_SPLIT tracks is whether
the THP was split or not. Whether it's subpages got successfully migrated later
or not, would be hidden in overall PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS and PGMIGRATE_FAIL values.

Above explanation (probably with some changes) looks better, will update.

Makes sense, will do.
