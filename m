As rule of the dumb. Keep everybody in that list informed till the last
version. What they do with is not our problem or concern.

Not really, for legacy and readability reasons keep it.
Without label both in nodename and as property one has to compare pin
numbers in pinctrl to see which node belong to each other.
Some users may want to add there own functions. With already available
label they can do so.

Let us know...

That people in the past blindly followed the manufacturer dts doesn't
make it an exception to the sort rule. Whatever you do, do it consistent.

Little longer version:
See my question at the sd regulator.
We have a pin to detect, but not to switch the regulator.
Haven't looked at the schematics. Just a reminder to check if it's
correct. Let us know..
