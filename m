A couple of things here...

This is ... not particularly self-explanatory.  Is that meant to be a
commit reference?  If so, you would want to use the normal format.

If you are going to do something like make an addition to the file, you
need to do that separately from a cleanup patch.

But somebody has to say this: I don't think we have any sort of laid-down
policy for what it takes to be mentioned in CREDITS, but I don't think that
your work thus far clears whatever bar we might set.  We don't immortalize
every person who submits some cleanup patches, or this file would be a long
one indeed.  If you would like to be remembered for your kernel work, I
would respectfully suggest that you move beyond mechanical cleanups into
higher-level work.

One other little thing that jumped out at me:

That link just redirects to linux.com, which is probably not what Alan had
in mind.  Replacing the link with one into the wayback machine (or perhaps
just removing it entirely) would seem like a more useful change than adding
HTTPS to a link that clearly does not reach the intended destination.

Thanks,
