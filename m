What ARM core is this? Is it a standard ARM TCM memory? The TCM 
interfaces from standard ARM cores in general are treated as normal 
memory, so write combine should be ok on them. When you say it doesn't 
work, whats not working - the memcpy/memset or the remoteproc doesn't boot?

This has other implications. Not everything is IO memory to make this 
change in the common core.

If this is a custom memory interface requiring specific handling, then 
one option is to provide and use your own ops->load function within the 
driver. This is what I do for one of our remoteprocs that requires a 
specific memcpy handling semantics.
