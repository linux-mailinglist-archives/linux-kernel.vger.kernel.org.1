It is, that isn't quite the the problem. Looking at it more I think
commit 1dbb6704de91 ("jump_label: Fix concurrent
static_key_enable/disable()") fixed some of it.

From what I can remember there were two parts to this problem, one being
fixed by the above commit, the other being that if we enable while a
task is running we miss the switch-in event (exactly how in this patch
we miss the enqueue).

Due to the missing switch-in, the state is 'weird' and the subsequent
IPI to install a remote event didn't quite work.

So I put that sync_sched() call in to guarantee all CPUs have done a
schedule() cycle after having the key switched. This makes sure that
every running task has seen the switch-in and thus the state is as
expected.

But like I said, I think we're good, that one extra branch deals with
the half-state.
