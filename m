Possibly Yes for some reasons below!

we could consider "qcom,qfrom" to be only passing corrected address 
space. Till we transition users to new bindings!

Yes.

No, we should still be using the same driver. But the exiting driver 
seems to incorrect and is need of fixing.

Having a look at the memory map for old SoCs like msm8996 and msm8916 
shows that memory map that was passed to qfprom driver is corrected 
address space. Writes will not obviously work!

This should also be true with sdm845 or sc7180

That needs to be fixed first!

Secondly, this IP is clearly an integral part of Secure Control Block, 
which clearly has versioning information.

Versioning information should be part of compatible string in msm8996 it 
should be "qcom,qfprom-5.1.0"
for msm8916 it should be "qcom,qfprom-4.0.0" this translates to 
"qcom,qfprom-<MAJOR-NUMBER>-<MINOR-NUMBER>-<STEP>"

Thirdly we should be able to have common read for all these as they tend 
to just read from corrected address space.

Offsets to corrected address space seems to always constant across SoCs too.

platform specific device tree nodes should also be able to specify 
"read-only" property to not allow writes on to this raw area.

Does this make sense ?
