I am actually trying to restore the behavior before the separate vdev
device creation. All allocations were coming from the rproc platform
device's DMA pool (if assigned, otherwise will fall back to global pool).

You have a valid point though, but are there any drivers relying on this
today? All the usage I saw were only using of_reserved_mem_device_init()
which is 0-indexed region by default. If this is really an issue, we can
use -1 as a means to conditionally follow this path.

Hmm, regarding the default name, vdev rings and vdev buffers are already
looking for specific names, right? So, what resource type are you
envisioning for this - RSC_CARVEOUT? Wouldn't that become a separate
allocation by itself?
