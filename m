It's not too bad.  Of the 5 patches I've sent out (3 for geni SPI, 2
for quad SPI) you've landed just one.  Here's the summary:

a) geni SPI 1/3 (Avoid clock setting): Has your Ack.
b) geni SPI 2/3 (autosuspend delay): Landed in SPI tree
c) geni SPI 3/3 (overhead in prepare_message): Has your Ack.

d) quad SPI 1/2 (Avoid clock setting): Needs your Ack.
e) quad SPI 2/2 (autosuspend delay): Needs your Ack.

Since b) has already landed in your tree, let's just leave it there.
There'll be a bit of a performance hit in the Qualcomm tree, but it'll
still be usable.

Since the rest haven't landed, it would be nice to just land them in
the Qualcomm tree.


I think there's still more work to make the Geni SPI driver more
optimized, but I don't think it'll be as urgent as those patches and I
feel like any more major work could wait a cycle.
