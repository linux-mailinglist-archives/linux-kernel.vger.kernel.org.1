Good point, this information should be added for both CPU and GPU regulator=
.
This could be nice to confirm this point with a scope.

Also I remark that Allwinner user higher temperature than what we set :
alarm_low_temp =3D <105000>;
alarm_high_temp =3D <110000>;
alarm_temp_hysteresis =3D <15000>;
shut_temp=3D <115000>;

m64/boot/dts/sunxi/sun50iw6p1.dtsi#L1924

Don't you think that we can push a bit higher the temperature it's
actually at 80=C2=B0C ?

Thanks for the review,
Clement
