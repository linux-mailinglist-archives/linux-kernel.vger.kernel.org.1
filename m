We couldn't patch Windows code because of the aforementioned DRM and
anti-cheat mechanisms, but I suppose this limitation doesn't apply to
Wine/native code, and if this assumption is correct, this approach could
work.

One complexity might be the consistent model for the syscall live
patching.  I don't know how much of the problem is diminished from the
original userspace live-patching problem, but I believe at least part of
it applies.  And fencing every thread to patch would kill performance.
Also, we cannot just patch everything at the beginning.  How does rr
handle that?

Another problem is that we will want to support i386 and other
architectures.  For int 0x80, it is trickier to encode a branch to
another region, given the limited instruction space, and the patching
might not be possible in hot paths.  I did port libsyscall-intercept to
x86-32 once and I could correctly patch glibc, but it's not guaranteed
that an updated libc or something else won't break it.

I'm not sure the benefit of not needing enhanced kernel support
justifies the complexity and performance cost required to make this work
reliably, in particular since the semantics for a kernel implementation
that we are discussing doesn't seem overly intrusive and might have
other applications like in the generic filter Andy mentioned.
