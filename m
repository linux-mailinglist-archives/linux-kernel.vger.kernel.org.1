I apologize if my statement was worded too broadly. I fully understand
your motivation and understand the sub job structure. It's more about
at which level to run proactive reclaim when there are sub-domains.

You said you're already using a feedback loop to adjust proactive
reclaim based on refault rates. How do you deal with this issue today
of one subgroup potentially having higher refaults due to a limit?

It appears that as soon as the subgroups can age independently, you
also need to treat them independently for proactive reclaim. Because
one group hitting its pressure limit says nothing about its sibling.

If you apply equal reclaim on them both based on the independently
pressured subjob, you'll under-reclaim the siblings.

If you apply equal reclaim on them both based on the unpressured
siblings alone, you'll over-pressurize the one with its own limit.

This seems independent of the exact metric you're using, and more
about at which level you apply pressure, and whether reclaim
subdomains created through a hard limit can be treated as part of a
larger shared pool or not.
