Hi,

Thanks for taking a look at this.

A non-cacheable attribute on arm64 pages. I think Mark R & Marc Z 
elaborated while I was asleep (thanks!).

Its the realtek software defined radio (SDR), a really inexpensive TV 
dongle that was discovered could be used as a general purpose SDR a 
decade or so ago. In particular, this project
https://github.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr/
which is packaged by fedora/etc.

This has been a problem on arm devices without IO coherent USB 
apparently for years. The rtl-sdr project itself has a disable zero-copy 
mode that people have been using on rpi/etc specific builds. Fedora 
OTOH, is building it with the same flags on x86 & arm64 which means that 
people report problems. This happened a few days ago (on a pinebook), 
and I duplicated it on an NXP platform just running the `rtl_test` 
artifact with a nooelec from my junk box. Guessing that it was a page 
mismatch I went looking for that, rather than disabling the zero copy 
since punishing arm machine that have IO coherent USB adapters for the 
sins of these low end devices isn't ideal. I found this, and this patch 
allows the rtl_test app to run without issues on my NXP/solidrun.

Plus, given that its actually a kernel/libusb problem its likely there 
are other applications having similar problems.

They have there are a lot of reports of sdr failures, but the general 
use case is rare?

Yes and no, I did some basic libusb tests on an x86 machine, but its a 
bit tricky at the moment for me to get the rtl plugged into a x86 test 
machine. (its a work in progress).

The particulars of asking for iocoherent memory and then mapping it to 
userspace is rarer than just asking for kmalloc()/remap() and then 
performing the dma ops?

Then there are all the softer issues around arm64 testing/availability 
and vendors carrying "fixes" for particular issues (like rtl-sdr 
disabling zero copy).

I don't think userspace is doing anything differently here, and AFAIK, 
on systems with IO coherent adapters this ends up with the same page 
mapping as just doing the remap_pfn_rage() with the same attributes as 
before. I've looked at dma_map_attrs() a bit, but i'm also trusting it 
does what it says on the tin.


Thanks again for looking at this.
