Seems like in that case our measurement is unreliable and can't really
be trusted.  That said, having things that were using the measurements
before this suddenly stop being able to access sealed secrets is not a
great experience for the user who unwittingly bought the junk hardware.
Same with the zero-supported-hashes case.  It would be nice to at log it
and have a way for them to opt-in to allowing the old measurement to go
through, so they can recover their data, though I don't know what that
method would be if the measured command line is one of their
dependencies.
