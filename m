This feels like a giant bodge to me and I think that any driver which
continues to perform DMA after its ->shutdown() function has been invoked
is buggy. Wouldn't that cause problems with kexec(), for example?

There's a clear shutdown dependency ordering, where the clients of the
SMMU need to shutdown before the SMMU itself, but that's not really
the SMMU driver's problem to solve.
