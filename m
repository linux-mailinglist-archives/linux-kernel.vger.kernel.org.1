All the csum functions should let the caller pass in a small value
to be added in (could be over 2^32 on 64 bit systems) since that is
normally 'free' in the algorithm - certainly better than adding it
it at the end - which is what the current x86 code does.
(For 64bit systems the 'small' value can exceed 2^32.)

I also wonder if the csum_and_copy() functions are actually worthwhile on x86.
The csum code can run at 8 bytes/clock on all Intel cpu since ivy bridge.
(It doesn't, it only does 4 bytes/clock until (IIRC) Haswell [1].)
On cpu that support ADCX/ADOX you may do better - probably 12 bytes/clock,
I think 16 bytes/clock is wishful thinking.
But there is no leeway for any extra uops in either case.

However trying to get a memory read, memory write, adc and bits of loop
control scheduled in one clock is probably impossible - even though
it might not exceed the number of uops the execution pipelines can process.
ISTR that just separating the memory read from the adc slows
thing down too much - probably issues with retiring instructions.
So I don't think it can get near 8 bytes/clock.

OTOH a copy operation trivially does 8 bytes/clock.
I even think 'rep movsq' is faster - never mind the fast 'rep movsb'.

So separate copy and checksum passes should easily exceed 4 bytes/clock,
but I suspect that doing them together never does.
(Unless the buffer is too big for the L1 cache.)

[1] The underlying problem is that a uop can only have 2 inputs.
ADC needs three (two values and the carry flag).
So the ADC instruction takes two clocks.
From ivy bridge (sandy?) the carry flag is available early,
so adding to alternate registers lets you do 1 per clock.
So the existing csum function is rather slower than adding
32bit values to a 64bit register on most older cpus.
