I saw both meta and node's writepages() called from background will skip
flushing dirty pages if dirty page count didn't touch the threshold.

	/* collect a number of dirty node pages and write together */
	if (wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_ALL &&
			get_pages(sbi, F2FS_DIRTY_NODES) <
					nr_pages_to_skip(sbi, NODE))
		goto skip_write;

	/* collect a number of dirty meta pages and write together */
	if (wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_ALL &&
			get_pages(sbi, F2FS_DIRTY_META) <
					nr_pages_to_skip(sbi, META))
		goto skip_write;

At that time, would syncfs (type sync command via shell) help?
