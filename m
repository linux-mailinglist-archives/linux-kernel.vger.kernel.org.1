At this time the options are in debugfs and vendors can decide to make that
available on products if they want to.  The idea behind using a kernel
configuration once moved to sysfs was to give the same kind of options.

My ultimate goal is to avoid needlessly stuffing things in sysfs.  My hope in
suggesting a new API was that platform drivers could recognise the kind of
build/environment they operate in and setup the coredump mode accordingly.  That
would have allowed us to leave debugfs options alone.

Correct - I am sure that moving coredump and recovery options to sysfs will
break user space scripts.  Even if debugfs is not part of the ABI it would be
nice to avoid disrupting people as much as possible.

I totally agree.  It is with great reluctance that I asked Rishab to proceed
the way he did in V3.  His usecase makes sense... On the flip side this is
pushed down on the kernel community and I really like Christoph's position about
fixing Android and leaving the kernel alone.
