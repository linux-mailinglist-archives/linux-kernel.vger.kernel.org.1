Your suggestion is more precise.

Yes, the default method can be used with PCI and PCIe device, and the VSEC 
approach is PCIe, only.  Documentation can be made more precise.

The Offset/BIR terminology is also used in the MSI-X capability structure.

I'll consider adding a register name and offset, but I am not sure it adds 
much information.

Initializing vndr_hdr = 0 ensures a failed pci_read_config_dword() failure 
is handled properly.  I will remove the call and the debug information 
anyway.

This initialization ensures that a failure to the pci_read_config_dword 
function below is handled properly.  It can be merged into the definition 
line.

Agreed.

Again, the assignment is ensuring that a failure to the 
pci_read_config_dword function is handled properly.

I suppose the call to dev_dbg can be removed.

I am not sure having more than one DFL in a bar serves any purpose over a 
single DFL.  Regardless, I think the consistency of just having Offset/BIR 
in the VSEC is better than adding more infomation that has little or no added value.
