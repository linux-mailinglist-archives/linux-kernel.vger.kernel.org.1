Okay. Let's change it then. Please make sure to update/remove
those old comments in the trigger(). And it's probably better
to mention that what we do now is a bit different from RM:
	/*
	 * Enable the opposite direction for synchronous mode
	 * 1. Tx sync with Rx: only set RE for Rx; set TE & RE for Tx
	 * 2. Rx sync with Tx: only set TE for Tx; set RE & TE for Rx
	 *
	 * RM recommends to enable RE after TE for case 1 and to enable
	 * TE after RE for case 2, but we here may not always guarantee
	 * that happens: "arecord 1.wav; aplay 2.wav" in case 1 enables
	 * TE after RE, which is against what RM recommends but should
	 * be safe to do, judging by years of testing results.
	 */

Btw, do we need similar change for TRIGGER_STOP?
