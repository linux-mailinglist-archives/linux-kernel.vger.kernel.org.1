And it appears that a default-niced CPU-bound SCHED_OTHER process is
not preempted by a newly awakened MAX_NICE SCHED_OTHER process.  OK,
OK, I never waited for more than 10 minutes, but on my 2.2GHz that is
close enough to a hang for most people.

Which means that the patch below prevents the hangs.  And maybe does
other things as well, firing rcutorture up on it to check.

But is this indefinite delay expected behavior?

This reproduces for me on current mainline as follows:

tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/bin/kvm.sh --allcpus --torture lock --duration 3 --configs LOCK05

This hangs within a minute of boot on my setup.  Here "hangs" is defined
as stopping the per-15-second console output of:
	Writes:  Total: 569906696 Max/Min: 81495031/63736508   Fail: 0
