Subject: [PATCH v4 0/3] Add board support for HK10 board variants
Date:   Fri,  9 Oct 2020 13:47:01 +0530
Message-Id: <1602231424-22288-1-git-send-email-gokulsri@codeaurora.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Added support for HK10-C1 and HK10-C2 board variants based on IPQ8074 SoC.
Both these variants support dual QCN9000 PCIe cards that uses MHI communication
protocol over PCIe. In addition, HK10-C1 support on-chip radio.
Both these variants slightly differ in clock configuation for ethernet.

This series depends on below series:
[V2,0/7] Add PCIe support for IPQ8074
[v7,0/9] remoteproc: qcom: q6v5-wcss: Add support for secure pil

changes since v3:
 - Addressed build failure reported by test robot
   in patch 3

changes since v2:
 - In patch 3, Moved pcie0_rp and pcie1_rp nodes and
   removed unused members and subnodes
