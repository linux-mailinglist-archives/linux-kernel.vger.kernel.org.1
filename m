Note that get_maintainer.pl is hardly perfect, and using a bit of 
judgement is a far better idea than zealously trusting it to be the one 
true CC list and spamming people with things they really aren't going to 
care about. I mean, I *still* occasionally get CCed on random PowerPC 
patches because I once touched a couple of couple of unrelated lines in 
one of their arch headers...

Even if you're perfectly happy to spend time scanning and deleting 
hundreds of irrelevant emails from your inbox every day, don't assume 
that everyone else feels the same way ;)

FWIW as far as lists go, if I have a good idea of who the target 
audience for a patch is then I'll only CC LKML for the sake of archiving 
if there aren't at least two other relevant lists on CC.

The LED's "label" property already canonically describes what it is. An 
unused DTS label just adds noise in the source and bloats DTBs built 
with symbols. If there really are users out there who want to use 
overlays to set a custom trigger or state for the fraction of boot time 
between the LED driver probing and when a udev rule could do it, I can't 
imagine they'd mind adding the couple of extra lines to specify the full 
node path in their overlay.

Looking at how the regulator core handles enable pins, I'd assume that a 
regulator can always be *logically* enabled and disabled regardless of 
whether doing so will actually physically switch it. (And I guess I've 
finally disproved my own thought about whether "regulator-always-on" is 
redundant for non-switchable regulators...)

It's not absolutely *mandatory* for VMMC to be switchable - some low-end 
boards simply take it off any old 3V3 rail, however that does prevent 
power-cycling the card to reset it if it gets into a bad state, so I'd 
tend to expect a well-designed board would carry the extra few cents of 
BOM cost for a switchable regulator.

I share Uwe's befuddlement here - VMMC and CD are pretty much entirely 
unrelated. If the dedicated CD function is used its internal pullup 
depends on VQMMC, but that means you can't power down the I/O when no 
card is present, because it then can't generate an interrupt when one 
*is* inserted (or like RK3288 the CD line just floats and fires 
interrupts randomly). At least on RK3399 they moved the CD pin to a 
different I/O bank where the GPIO function is always-on regardless of 
VQMMC, so using the pin as a GPIO here allows the whole SDMMC block to 
be fully powered down when idle. None of which has anything to do with 
VMMC, which is the main power supply to the card itself and doesn't go 
anywhere near the SoC...
