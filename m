Yes, now that hugetlb_cma_reserve() has been moved into hugetlb_add_hstate().
But then there is an explicit warning while trying to mix both the command
line options i.e hugepagesz= and hugetlb_cma=. The proposed code here have
not changed that behavior and hence the following warning should have been
triggered here as well.

1) hugepagesz_setup()
	hugetlb_add_hstate()
		 hugetlb_cma_reserve()

2) hugepages_setup()
	hugetlb_hstate_alloc_pages()	when order >= MAX_ORDER

	if (hstate_is_gigantic(h)) {
        	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_CMA) && hugetlb_cma[0]) {
                	pr_warn_once("HugeTLB: hugetlb_cma is enabled, skip boot time allocation\n");
			break;
                }
		if (!alloc_bootmem_huge_page(h))
                break;
	}

Nonetheless, it does not make sense to mix both memblock and CMA based huge
page pre-allocations. But looking at this again, could this warning be ever
triggered till now ? Unless, a given platform calls hugetlb_cma_reserve()
before _setup("hugepages=", hugepages_setup). Anyways, there seems to be
good reasons to keep both memblock and CMA based pre-allocations in place.
But mixing them together (as done in the proposed code here) does not seem
to be right.

There is no problem with that reasoning. __setup() triggered function should
be able perform CMA reservation. But as pointed out before, it does not make
sense to mix both CMA reservation and memblock based pre-allocation.

IIUC, CMA reservation and memblock alloc have some differences in terms of
how the memory can be used later on, will have to dig deeper on this. But
the comment section near cma_declare_contiguous_nid() is a concern.

 * This function reserves memory from early allocator. It should be
 * called by arch specific code once the early allocator (memblock or bootmem)
 * has been activated and all other subsystems have already allocated/reserved
 * memory. This function allows to create custom reserved areas.

Calling it too late might have got the page allocator initialized completely
and then CMA reservation would not be possible afterwards. Also calling it
too early would prevent other subsystems which might need memory reservation
in specific physical ranges.
