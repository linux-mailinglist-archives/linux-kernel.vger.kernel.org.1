This is more brief, i will use 'found_spe' as 'arm_spe_pmu' is not initialized.

Yes, we have a memory leak here indeed, i forgot to free it in this function.
As 'arm_spe_pmus' is defined as static, i think the author meant to assign it only at the first call,
but this function is only called once when we executing 'record', should i go on fixing it
or just drop the patch 1?
