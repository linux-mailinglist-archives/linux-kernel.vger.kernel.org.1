Sure. My vague impression is that your (and similar cloud companies) kind of
workloads are designed to maximize machine utilization, and overshooting and
killing something as a result is no big deal. Then you perhaps have more
probability of hitting this state, and on the other hand, even an occasional
premature oom kill is not a big deal?

My concers are workloads not designed in such a way, where premature oom kill
due to temporary higher reclaim activity together with burst of incoming network
packets will result in e.g. killing an important database. There, the tradeoff
looks different.

Andrew mentioned some. I don't recall any, so it might have been before my time.
