This should be done inside the sdw_bus. controller should not care about
this IMO.

I was thinking of following code in bus.c

static DEFINE_IDA(sdw_ida);

static sdw_get_id(struct sdw_bus *bus)
{
        int rc = ida_alloc(&sdw_ida, GFP_KERNEL);

        if (rc < 0)
                return rc;

        bus->id = rc;
        return 0;
}

int sdw_add_bus_master(struct sdw_bus *bus)
{
        ...

        ret = sdw_get_id(bus);

        ...
}

void sdw_delete_bus_master(struct sdw_bus *bus)
{
        da_free(&sdw_ida, bus->id);
}

This way you get a unique master number across all devices and this has
nothing to do with link/of ids and is used for numbering masters in
sysfs uniquely.
