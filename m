Okay, I misread this the first time.

The problem is that in limit reclaim we reset A.elow in anticipation
of treating B and C as the top-level groups of our scan cycle and will
be using their B.low and C.low verbatim. Global reclaim can then visit
them before us and propagate A.elow=0 down to them.

But doesn't this problem cut both ways? Say you have the following
subtree:

	A (memory.max=10G, memory.low=2G)
	`- A1 (memory.low=max)
	`- A2 (memory.low=max)
	`- A3 (memory.low=0)

A similar race can give A1 and A2 absolute exemption from global
reclaim instead of proportional distribution of the parental 2G.

The chances of that happening could be boosted maliciously by
triggering many short limit reclaim invocations, like ioless cache
from sparse files, to keep overwriting A1.elow and A2.elow to max.

I think to address this, we need a more comprehensive solution and
introduce some form of serialization. I'm not sure yet how that would
look like yet.

I'm still not sure it's worth having a somewhat ugly workaround in
mem_cgroup_protection() to protect against half of the bug. If you
think so, the full problem should at least be documented and marked
XXX or something.

In practice, I doubt this matters all that much because limit reclaim
and global reclaim tend to occur in complementary
containerization/isolation strategies, not heavily simultaneously.
