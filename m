str_has_prefix() is an always_inline function so it should be build
time evaluated as well.  I think most compilers see len as being a
constant and unchanged, so elide the variable.  This means the code
generated should be the same.

That's your prerogative as a Maintainer ... I was just explaining what
the original author had in mind when str_has_prefix() was created.
