Linux doesn't use Group-0 interrupts, as they are strictly secure
(unless your SoC doesn't have EL3, which I doubt).

Sending a NMI IPI from another NMI handler? Even once I've added these,
there is no way this will work for that particular scenario. Just look
at the restrictions we impose on NMIs.

Frankly, if all you need to do is to reset the SoC, use EL3 firmware.
That is what it is for.
