I initially traced some issues back to commit:

  044d0d6de9f50192 ("lockdep: Only trace IRQ edges")

... and that change of semantic could cause us to miss edges in some
cases, but IIUC mostly where we haven't done the right thing in
exception entry/return.

I don't think my patches address this case yet, but my WIP (currently
just fixing user<->kernel transitions) is at:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mark/linux.git/log/?h=arm64/irq-fixes

I'm looking into the kernel<->kernel transitions now, and I know that we
mess up RCU management for a small window around arch_cpu_idle, but it's
not immediately clear to me if either of those cases could cause this
report.

Thanks,
Mark.
