No swap configured in our system.

I haven't had a chance to rerun stress with kmem leak detection to know 
if we still see OOM kills after min_free_kbytes restore.

In our case SoC with 8GB memory, system tuned min_free_kbytes
- first to 22528
- we perform memory hot add very early in boot
- now min_free_kbytes is 8703

Before looking at code, first I manually restored min_free_kbytes soon 
after boot, reran stress and didn't notice symptoms I mentioned in 
change log.

Thanks,
Vijay
