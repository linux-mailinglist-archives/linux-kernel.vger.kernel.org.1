Goodday

I think you will not be happy, because I have a very bad news for=20
you. Just a few months ago I hacked your operating system and I=20
have full control of your device.

I implanted a small application into your device which sends me=20
your current IP address and allows me to connect to your device=20
just like remote desktop.

Even if you change your password, it won=E2=80=99t help.

How I infected you?
The router that you used to connect to Internet had a security=20
hole.
You can read about this problem by searching for CVE-2018-10562.
I hacked your router and I put my code into it, and when you=20
tried to connect to Internet, my program infected your device.

Later I made a full copy of your hard drive (I have all your=20
email contact lists, list of websites you visited, phone numbers,=20
your passwords etc.)


A little while later, when I was searching your web browsing=20
history I was shocked by what I saw!! The sites for adults you=20
are visiting... you know what I mean...

I just want to say - your fantasies are shifted far away from the=20
normal course!...

For months I have been spying on you through your device camera..=20
especially when you visited those sites to have fun...Those=20
videos show clearly you having fun and the content for adults you=20
were watching.. this is pretty nasty and I would be very worried=20
if I were you.

I have secured 2 videos:
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org_1557074047.mp4 (119.1 MB)
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org_1555285697.mp4 (64.5 MB)

You can verify that the timestamps correspond to the moments you=20
were enjoying yourself...Now, because I do not like at all what I=20
saw (that=E2=80=99s pretty crazy and ugly) I ask you to send me a=20
donation through Bitcoin network. 2000 US dollars is a fair price=20
(considering your perversions).

If you want me to forget about the whole case, remove the files=20
and disable the nasty app that is spying you, send me the Bitcoin=20
payment within 72 hours. Yes, I give you 72 hours only.

Here is my wallet:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Send exactly 0.291578 BTC to my address:
1JiE6YXy2rvZJfVb1E3JnSCdEjmgKqUkm5

(copy it and paste - it=E2=80=99s case sensitive)
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
0.291578 BTC =3D 2000 dollars

If you do not send me the Bitcoin, I promise you - I will send=20
those 4 files with you enjoying yourself to all your contact=20
lists, associates and social network friends.

I still have access to your device and I know when you read this=20
message. When you opened it, time started ticking. You have 72=20
hours only!

I am from Russia and nobody will help you if you report this=20
email.. Before they find me your life will be ruined! If you do=20
not cooperate with me - I will release this ugly material=20
immediately.

This is why I advise you - send me the Bitcoin and let=E2=80=99s forget=20
about the whole situation. I know you can afford it.

If you do not know how to send bitcoin

Step 1: Create an account on www.localbitcoins.com
Step 2: Buy 0.291578 BITCOIN
Step 3: Send the amount on this BTC address:=20
1JiE6YXy2rvZJfVb1E3JnSCdEjmgKqUkm5
Step 4: Contact me on this email address chanblogger@aol.com
with this subject: 980VIPERMARVO-RESTOREKEYPC00765
After this steps you will receive through email the key and a
decrypt tutorial.

Here is another list where you can buy bitcoin:=20
https://bitcoin.org/en/exchanges


Here is my address again:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Send exactly:

0.291578 BTC

to my address: 1JiE6YXy2rvZJfVb1E3JnSCdEjmgKqUkm5

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Remember to send the exact amount as above! This way I will know=20
it=E2=80=99s from you.

Do not be angry at me. This is just my job, and you are not the=20
only person I caught.

Be angry at your fantasies - if you didn=E2=80=99t visit those sites for=20=

adults you would have no problem.. but now...

I am waiting for your bitcoin.

Remember, time is ticking..
