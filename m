It is not ideal. But currently we handle all events as key press. And
non-key events are marked as ignored.

I agree, it should be handled in better way. But that needs to extend
driver. But it is something which should be done in next patches, not in
this one (if somebody has time to do it, etc...).

I agree. Handle it in the same way like we handle all other events. That
would make it easier to migrate to the new way, once it is there.
