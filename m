Additional testing with fio has shown near theoretical write speeds if I 
test direct to the /dev/md device instead of using either xfs or ext4.

I've tested different queue settings without significant changes.

Is it possible to get a single XFS or ext4 filesystem performing with 
 >10GB/s write speeds?
