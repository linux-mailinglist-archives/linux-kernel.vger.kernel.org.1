Yes, we are using the bindable-irq thing. It's easier for the UEFI team.
Firmware doesn't need to too much modification.

My origin thought is using a new event-id. But the firmware guys are new to SDEI
and don't know how to add a new event-id.

Yes, we are using the secure timer irq as the watchdog irq. So the firmware
needs to disable and enable the irq when we disable and enable the event. But
linux don't need to modify the irqchip hardware about the secure timer irq.

All works well except the kdump situation. Because in sdei_handler the secure
timer irq, which is routed to EL3, remains active. We clear the EOI when we
complete the event. So when we panic and start kdump in sdei_handler, the EL2
interrupt of the second kernel can not be taken. We add a hack to clear the EOI
before start kdump.

Yes, the pNMI is a much better fit. We don't need such a hack. But the product
department seems to have get used to the SDEI watchdog method. It works well and
they don't want much change.

Thanks,
Xiongfeng
