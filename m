Absolutely. This issue has been lingering for some time now, and needs
addressing.

I'm definitely in favour of reverting this patch, although there are
two possible alternatives:

- Cherry-pick 9fd339a45be5 ("arm64: Work around broken GCC 4.9
  handling of "S" constraint"), which works around this particular GCC
  bug

- Cherry-pick dca5244d2f5b ("compiler.h: Raise minimum version of GCC
  to 5.1 for arm64"), which forbids GCC 4.9 as it has been
  demonstrated to mis-compile the kernel (and this patch is targeting
  stable anyway)

Thanks,

	M.
