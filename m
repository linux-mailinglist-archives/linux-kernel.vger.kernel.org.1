Isn't it wrong to set may_passthrough_inline_crypto on dm-zero?  First, there's
no actual underlying device associated with dm-zero, so the idea of dm-zero
"passing through" anything is strange.

Second, inline encryption is supposed to semantically operate on the original
bio.  I.e. if someone reads some data from dm-zero and they use a bio_crypt_ctx
that indicates the data should be decrypted, then I'd expect that either the bio
would fail, *or* it would return back data which is equal to the decryption of
the all-zeroes ciphertexts.

may_passthrough_inline_crypto=false would give that behavior.  Whereas with
may_passthrough_inline_crypto=true, the bio's encryption context may just be
ignored and reads will return all zeroes.

Of course, setting an encryption context for I/O to/from dm-zero isn't really
something that people would do anyway...  But it seems we shouldn't bother
setting may_passthrough_inline_crypto on it when it seems wrong.
