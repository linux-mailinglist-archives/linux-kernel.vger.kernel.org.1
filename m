Expanding on this a little, we're working on a couple of projects that
should provide results like these for upstream.  One is continuously
rebasing our upstream backlog onto new kernels for testing purposes
(the idea here is to make it easier for us to update kernels on
Chromebooks), and the second is to drive more stuff into the
kernelci.org infrastructure.  Given the test environments we have in
place now, we can probably get results from our continuous rebase
project first and provide those against -rc releases if that's
something you'd be interested in.  Going forward, I hope we can
extract several of our tests and put them into kernelci as well, so we
get more general coverage without the potential impact of our (still
somewhat large) upstream backlog of patches.

To Joel's point, there are a few changes we'll have to make to get
similar results outside of our environment, but I think that's doable
without a ton of work.  And if anyone is curious, I think most of this
stuff is already public in the tast and autotest repos of the
chromiumos tree.  Just let us know if you want to make changes or port
to another environment so we can try to stay in sync wrt new features,
etc.

Thanks,
Jesse
