So, you are attempting to manage the power mode of the device.  The 
standard mechanism to do so in Linux is runtime pm.

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst

I'm no runtime pm expert, but it feels like your whole voting mechanism, 
etc is just reimplemeting that.  Reimplementing the wheel, when its been 
a standard thing that the majority of the kernel uses is not usually 
acceptable.

IMO, you need some sort of justification why runtime pm is not 
applicable for you, because I'm willing to bet Mani/Greg are going to 
ask the same.
