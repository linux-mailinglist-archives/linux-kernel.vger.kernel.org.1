Yeah, I'm not against returning the next character - it's good.
The only concern was whether it should return -1 or 0 when
it meets EOF after parsing some digits.

But I think we can go with this version as there's no such case
when parsing /proc/pid/maps.

The performance gain looks nice!  Thanks for working on this.
