Hurmph.. I think I understand the problem, but I'm not sure what to do
about it :-(

Esp. given the uclamp optimization patches now under consideration. That
is, if random drivers are going to install uclamps, then that will
automagically enable the static_key and make the scheduler slower, even
if that driver isn't particularly interesting to the user.
