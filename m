That's awesome, thank you for testing.

Regarding the turbostat output you attached to an earlier email, it confirms
the suspicion that the 4C turbo is reported as zero (being a 2 cores / 4 threads
machine), explaining why the fix works:

  cpu2: MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT: 0x00001313
  19 * 133.3 = 2533.3 MHz max turbo 2 active cores
  19 * 133.3 = 2533.3 MHz max turbo 1 active cores

In the above, bits 31:24 are zero. It's not a universal rule, though: my laptop
also has a 2 cores / 4 threads cpu, and that same MSR says:

  cpu3: MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT: 0x1b1b1b1b1b1d
  27 * 100.0 = 2700.0 MHz max turbo 6 active cores
  27 * 100.0 = 2700.0 MHz max turbo 5 active cores
  27 * 100.0 = 2700.0 MHz max turbo 4 active cores
  27 * 100.0 = 2700.0 MHz max turbo 3 active cores
  27 * 100.0 = 2700.0 MHz max turbo 2 active cores
  29 * 100.0 = 2900.0 MHz max turbo 1 active cores

So despite my CPU being similar to yours, it wouldn't show the bug. There is
even more: the bug can show on large core counts too, as seen in
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/bf43772d-48e5-01d4-dd03-330110e487fa@linux.intel.com/
Like Xu from Intel has an Atom P-Series with 24 physical cores, yet their
MSR goes like:

  MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT: 0x00000016

which means only the 1C turbo is reported non-zero (that machine doesn't have
turbo at all, 1C turbo is the same as base frequency).


Thanks,
Giovanni
