You refer to a normal "poweroff" or is this some kind of "shutdown now"
kind of thing? Unless I'm mistaken, the `halt' command above will turn
off the machine without stopping user tasks (as in "reaching shutdown
level").

So you say that normally the machine shuts down immediately but now it
takes 20secs+ if it shuts down at all?

The CD-drive is polled regularly so it notices when a CD us inserted /
removed. It seems that one of the requests wasn't answered and it ended
up in timeout.

So reboot is not affected, just the halt. Could you please check if the
"poweroff" variant is also affected?

You should see a warning if you were facing the problem described in the
commit.

Can you send dmesg output of the system / lspci -k? I'm mainly
interested what drivers are bound to storage devices (you can send it
offlist if you want).

Can you log the output on the serial console?

If the commit you cited is really the problem then it would mean that a
worker isn't scheduled for some reason. Could you please enable
CONFIG_WQ_WATCHDOG to see if workqueue core code notices that a worker
isn't making progress?
