OK, that is fair enough.

That argument can be be used the other way too if this is a platform
choice, the platform boot loader can ensure that both ends of the SMC
agree on the shared memory region. I do see an advantage to the approach
being suggested here that the shared memory does not necessarily need to
be mapped by the TF prior to Linux booting, but it can be deferred until
when Linux makes the first SMC call but that may require more complexity
on the TF side to issue an appropriate MMU update, so maybe from a
security perspective this is more dangerous..

Alright, I am convinced now this is useful :)
