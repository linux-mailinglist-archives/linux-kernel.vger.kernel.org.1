Yes, I also think that's the reason for this improvement. The test box is
using mgag200 driver, while the vm-scalability test case itself will print
many messages to the gfx console. If commit 913ec479bb "drm/mgag200: Replace
VRAM helpers with SHMEM helpers" improves the console handling, then it
will impact the final score of the test case.

Last time we met similar case that a console write slowdown triggers a
regression is discussed here:
