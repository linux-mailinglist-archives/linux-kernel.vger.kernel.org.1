Sorry that I misunderstood your question. Yes it has solved problem of higher
water marks seen in the zone than what I set through min_free_kbytes.

Below are the steps I pursued to reproduce the problem
1) My system setup of Android kernel running on snapdragon hardware have the 
   below settings as default:
   #cat /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes = 5162
   #cat /proc/zoneinfo | grep -e boost -e low -e "high " -e min -e Node
	Node 0, zone   Normal
        	min      797
	        low      8340
        	high     8539
        	boost    0 // This is the extra print I have added to check the boosting
2) Now I just try to change the zone watermark when the ->watermark_boost
   is greater than zero. I just write the same value of min_free_kbytes in 
   which case we should have seen the watermarks same as default(I mean of step 1)

   #echo 5162 > /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes

   But I have seen very high values of watermarks in the system,
  # cat /proc/zoneinfo | grep -e boost -e low -e "high " -e min -e Node
	Node 0, zone   Normal
      	  min      797
      	  low      21148
      	  high     21347
      	  boost   0

So, yes, this problem is got fixed with the changes made in this patch.
