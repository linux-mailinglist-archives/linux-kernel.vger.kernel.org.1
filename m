No problem, since as it turned out, I didn't have to time till now to
follow up on your latest suggestions.  Details below.

I recompiled kernel 5.6.4 with the printk() call you suggested, then
booted the kernel with "ignore_loglevel initcall_debug" (but leaving the
CDROM and wifi intact for now).  After working as I normally do, I
called `shutdown -h now', again as usual.  After the "Bringing down the
loopback interface" message there were these two messages:

reboot: __do_sys_reboot(317)CMD: 89abcdef
reboot: __do_sys_reboot(317)CMD: 4321fedc

Then nothing more for two minutes, then, as previously:

sr 5:0:0:0: tag#10 timing out command, waited 120 seconds.

Then I did a hard reboot.

This morning I detached the cables to the CDROM (but left the disk in
the box) and again booted 5.6.4 with "ignore_loglevel initcall_debug".
After working for a bit, I called `shutdown -h now', and now there were
quite a few more messages, but again the machine did not power off.
Here is the ouput, which I transcribed carefully, hopefully without
error (I omitted the fractional parts of the timestamps and some of the
usb1-portX messages):

After the last message here, the "echo", Call Trace, RIP and register
messages were repeated exactly as above.  At this point I did a hard
reboot.  A web search found something similar to the above output
("System hangs (bad RIP value) when disk used in pool is removed"), but
didn't otherwise seem to be related to the problem I'm having.

Do you still want me to check whether removing the iwlwifi driver makes
a differece?  And with the CDROM still detached, or does that not
matter?
