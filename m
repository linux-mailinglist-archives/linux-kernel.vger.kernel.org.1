Ok, still not particularly clear given where they are used and how
it's related to updated_children but like you say later it's "kinda
irrelevant" :)

Ah, thanks for that explanation.

It is.

Even if it's a future thing it helps me to know the accuracy does not
have to be perfect. It means if it bothers me enough, I can take a shot
at addressing it myself without having to worry that some controller is
broken as a side-effect.

That's perfect, thanks!
