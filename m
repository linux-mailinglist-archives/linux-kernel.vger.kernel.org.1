Hi,

Dan, I also uncertain as to how you read this as referring to DIO. Case 2 is
DMA or RDMA, and in fact the proposed commit log says both of those things:
Case 2 and DMA/RDMA. I don't see "DIO" anywhere here...

Well, I've gotten away with the current wording for quite a few patches so
far, but that sure doesn't mean it's perfect! :)

Maybe adding the words that Dan suggests, above, will suffice? Here:

 >>> "In 2019 we introduced pin_user_pages() and now we are converting
 >>> get_user_pages() to the new API as appropriate".
