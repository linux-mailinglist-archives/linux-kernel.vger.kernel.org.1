Doug/Stephen,

Yes this is a bug, we wouldn't want
to disable aoss_qmp genpd for modem
during suspend (when the modem is
running). The qmp send for modem
is the primary means through which
aoss determines whether to wait for
modem before proceeding to sleep. So
looks like updating the flag with
GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP is the way
to go. But introducing another flag
that doesn't touch genpd's during
suspend/resume should also work.
