That is _not_ what this check is doing. I recommend looking closely at
the example you posted. This is not about whether or not a descriptor is
pointing to this lpos. In your example you showed that ID, state, and
lpos values could all look good, but it is for the _new_ record and we
should _not_ invalidate that one.

We can detect the scenario you pointed out by verifying the tail has not
moved beyond the data block that the ID was read from. The comment for
this check says:

    If @lpos_begin has fallen behind the tail lpos,
    the read block ID cannot be trusted.

This is exactly the why. It is only about whether we can trust that a
non-garbage block ID was read. Or do you want me to add:

    ... because data read that is behind the tail lpos must be
    considered garbage.

No. Your example showed that it is not caught here.

OK. I will expand the comments to something similar to this.

If we remove it, we end up back at your bug report. ;-)
