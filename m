Sure, KSM does not increment page counter, when a page becomes PageKsm().
Is patch comment about that? Even if so, I don't understand what this
comment is about. "PageKsm() does not take additional counter" is not
a reason the page can't be reused there. The reason is that readers
of this page may increase a counter without taking the lock, so
this page_count() == 1 under the lock does not guarantee anything.
