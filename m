It doesn't make sense to set DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG in generic
distro because such policy is configured at build time in the kernel
with hardcoded CAs. If the new option is not set then nothing change. I
don't see why it could be an issue for use cases we previously defined
(with DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG).

The current documentation remains true.
DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG_SECONDARY_KEYRING depends on
DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG.

Right, it's only different from the kernel point of view.
