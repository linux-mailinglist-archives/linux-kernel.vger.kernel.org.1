Honestly I am not sure how much is GFP_BOOT_MASK still needed. The
remaining user of gfp_allowed_mask mask should be only hibernation and I
believe this should be removed in long term. Not as trivial because
scope API cannot be used for that as it needs a global flag but this is
a gross hack that should be implemented differently. It is waiting on my
todo list but never got around to that.

stack depod depends on a lock IIRC. Anyway, this is just showing how
this is going to grow in complexity and make future additions harder.
A niche usecase is inducing an additional complexity for future
maintenance.
