Few more details about this.

Even if I have vma_ra_enabled (in /sys/kernel/mm/swap/vma_ra_enabled) it
looks like my virtio_blk device is considered rotational by default:

$ cat /sys/block/vda/queue/rotational
1

Therefore the vma readahead is not used. If I change this to
"rotational" then the vma readahead is used; this is confirmed by the
fact that swapin_nr_pages isn't called anymore:

r::swapin_nr_pages(unsigned long offset):unsigned long:$retval
	COUNT      EVENT
	13         $retval = 1
	18         $retval = 2
	23         $retval = 4
	29         $retval = 8

swapoff time: 16.44s

In terms of swapoff performance vma readahead works better than the
vanilla cluster readahead (~21s), but the "improved" cluster readahead
(with lookup_swap_cache() in unuse_pte_range()) still gives slightly
better results (~12s).
