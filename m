OK, I did try with a small patch initially and then realised we must hit
issue with mainline as is. Tried and the behaviour is exact same. All
I did is removed my patches and use bit[0] as the signal. It doesn't
matter as writes to the register are now serialised. Oh, the above
message comes when OS times out in advance while firmware continues to
process the old request and respond.

The trace I sent gives much better view of what's going on.
