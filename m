Thanks for reviewing the patches Rob.

Sure - I'll add your patches to this series.

I think FDT allocation using vmalloc for ARM64 can be changed to 
kmalloc. What are the other changes you'd like me to do in arm64/powerpc 
DT kexec code in this patch series?

@AKASHI Takahiro - could you please let me know if the above sounds right?

I'll create the patch series in "next-integrity" branch.

Thiago/Mimi have acked some of the patches. Please review the remaining 
patches in this version.

Could arm64 maintainers please review the patches and respond?

thanks,
