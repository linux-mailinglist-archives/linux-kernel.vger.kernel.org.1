I think it should be ok in functional terms, but I don't like the rationale
and also doubt the change is really needed.

If the pull is removed to match the Bluetooth module, then that sounds as
if the signal was floating on the the BT side, which I think is not the case.
Yes, according to the datasheet there is no pull when the BT controller is
active, but then it drives the signal actively to either high or low. There
seems to be no merit in 'matching' the Bluetooth side in this case, if the
signal was really floating on the BT side we would definitely not want this.

In a reply to v2 you said:

What are these conflicting pull states?

The WCN3998 datasheet has a pull-down on RTS (WCN3998 side) in reset and
boot mode, and no pull in active mode. In reset and boot mode the host
config with a pull down would match, and no pull in active mode doesn't
conflict with the pull-down on the host UART. My understanding is that
the pinconf pulls are weak pulls, so as soon as the BT chip drives its
RTS the pull on the host side shouldn't matter.

Is this change actually related with wakeup support? I have the impression
that multiple things are conflated in this patch. If some of the changes
are just fixing/improving other things they should be in a separate patch,
which could be part of this series, otherwise it's really hard to
distinguish between the pieces that are actually relevant for wakeup and
the rest.

Independently of whether the changes are done in a single or multiple
patches, the commit log should include details on why the changes are
necessary, especially when there are not explantatory comments in the
DT/code itself (e.g. the removal of 'output-high', which seems correct
to me, but no reason is given why it is done).

[copy of my comment on v2]

I'm a bit at a loss here, about two things:

RTS is an output pin controlled by the UART. IIUC if the UART port is active
and hardware flow control is enabled the RTS signal is either driven to high
or low, but not floating.

Now lets assume I'm wrong with the above and RTS can be floating. We only want
the BT SoC to send data when the host UART is ready to receive them, right?
RTS is an active low signal, hence by configuring it as a pull-down the BT
SoC can send data regardless of whether the host UART actually asserts RTS,
so the host UART may not be ready to receive it. I would argue that if there
is really such a thing as a floating RTS signal then it should have a pull-up,
to prevent the BT SoC from sending data at any time.

I'm not an expert in UART communication and pinconf, so it could be that I
got something wrong, but as of now it seems to me that no pull is the correct
config for RTS.

I don't know all the details, but I have the impression that this is the
relevant pull change for wakeup. From the title of the series I derive
that the UART RX pin is used for signalling wakeup. A pull-down on RTS
indicates the BT controller that it can always send data to wake up the
host.

I think RTS in default mode should remain with no-pull (the UART is driving
the signal), and then change it to pull-down in sleep mode.

nit: just say '... on TX ...', the GPIO number isn't really interesting and can
easily be determined by looking at 'pins' if needed . Applicable to all comments
involving pins.

This makes sense to me.
