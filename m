Thanks for clarifying that.  I had the same concern that tglx had.

That scenario plays out today with the current timestamp.  Printing debug with a
better timestamp doesn't resolve that problem nor is it intended to.

While I agree, in general, your alternative is useful for in-person debugging it
is not helpful in cases where a user only has an image of a panic where the
printk time-synch message has scrolled off the screen.

Consider this real debug case where I hacked the boottime stamp into printk:  We
had some systems with flaky HW that hit panics at 10 hours [1] of uptime.  Since
these systems came from different vendors with different HW the clocks were
out-of-sync.  I had a suspicion that it was some human-coded event causing the
HW to die but wasn't sure until I did a boottime-stamped printk to prove that
all the systems died after 10 hours.

I could have set a stopwatch or timer to somehow catch this kind of event.  I
could have set up video cameras to watch the consoles, etc.  There are a lot of
other ways I could have debugged this situation but ultimately the fastest thing
to do was code and provide kernels to the various HW companies and see if
everything lined up as I thought it would.

This problem happens far more often then I'd like to admit and we still see this
type of problem with new HW and FW.  I also recall that other kernel groups
(storage, networking, etc.) were interested in the timestamps as it would make
their debugging easier to have a true synchronized timestamp available.

One other thing -- IIRC I had to modify the dmesg code by providing a sysfs (or
proc?) interface for dmesg to identify the stamp.  It's something that should be
investigated with this code too.

P.

[1] It was 3+ years ago.  I can't remember if it was 10 or 100 but you get the
point.
