Looks clean to me.  The definition of "major faults" will slightly change even
for those who has done the "major |= fault & MAJOR" operations before, but at
least I can't see anything bad about that either...

To make things easier, we can use the 1st patch to introduce this change,
however pass regs==NULL at the callers to never trigger this accounting.  Then
we can still use one patch for each arch to do the final convertions.

IMHO it's still common to have a "total" statistics in softwares even if each
of the subsets are accounted separately.  Here it's just a bit special because
there're only two elements so the addition is so straightforward.  It seems a
trade-off on whether we'd like to do the accounting of errornous faults, or we
want to make it cleaner by put them altogether but only successful page faults.
I slightly preferred the latter due to the fact that I failed to find great
usefulness out of keeping error fault accountings, but no strong opinions..

Thanks,
