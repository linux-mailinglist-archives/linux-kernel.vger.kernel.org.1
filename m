This misses critical functionality in KVM.  KVM snapshots boot_cpu_data at
module load time (and does further modifications) for ongoing reuse in
filtering what features are advertised to the userspace VMM.  See
kvm_set_cpu_caps() for details.

Even if you found a way to reference kvm_cpu_caps, that still leaves the
problem of existing guests having been created with stale data.  Oh, and
KVM also needs to properly handle MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL.

Rather than forcefully tearing down guests, what about adding a way to block
updates, e.g. KVM would block updates on module load and unblock on module
exit. That puts the onus of coordinating updates on the orchestration layer
where it belongs.

KVM aside, it wouldn't surprise in the least if there is other code in the
kernel that captures bug state locally.  This series feels like it needs a
fair bit of infrastructure to either detect conflicting usage at build time
or actively prevent consuming stale state at runtime.

There's also the problem of the flags being exposed to userspace via
/proc/cpuinfo, though I suppose that's userspace's problem to not shoot
itself in the foot.
