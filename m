I'd welcome some feedback on the proposal I sent out at the end of last
week:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200626095551.GA9312@willie-the-truck

which looks to solve some (all?) of these issues slightly differently,
because it turns out we need to perform some low-level surgery for
preempt-rt *anyway*...

I'm particularly keen to hear any thoughts concerning the reschedule on
return to EL1 after handling an interrupt that hit during a step.
