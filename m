I don't understand what you are saying here.

we start with all pages accessible, we mark pages as inaccessible when
they are imported in the secure guest (we use the PG_arch_1 bit in
struct page). we then try to catch all I/O on inaccessible pages and
make them accessible so that I/O devices are happy. when we need to
make page inaccessible again, we mark the page, make sure the counters
and the flag in struct page look ok, then we actually make it
inaccessible. this way pages that are undergoing I/O will never
actually transition from from accessible to inaccessible, although they
might briefly marked as inaccessible. this means that the flag we use
to mark a page inaccessible is overindicating, but that is fine.

pages need to be accessible in order to be used for I/O, and need to be
inaccessible in order to be used by protected VMs.

we use the PG_arch_1 bit to actually stop access to the page, freezing
is used just for a short moment to make sure nobody is touching the
page and avoid races while we are checking.

either your quick and dirty patch was too dirty (e.g. not accounting
for possible races between make_accessible/make_inaccessible), or some
of the functions in the trace you provided should do pin_user_page
instead of get_user_page (or both)


our first implementation (before FOLL_PIN was introduced) called
make_page_accessible for each FOLL_GET. Once FOLL_PIN was introduced,
we thought it would be the right place. If you think calling
make_accessible for both FOLL_PIN and FOLL_GET is the right thing, then
I can surely patch it that way.

I'll send out an v2 for fs/splice later on today.
