It is up to automarkup.py to change from "struct foo" into:
	:c:type:`struct foo` (Sphinx 2.x)
or:
	:c:struct:`foo` (Sphinx 3.x)

At v5, the automarkup.py extension was disabled, as it was broken
with Sphinx > 2.x. At v6, I added a patch from N=C3=ADcolas addressing
it.

It should be said that, currently, if there's no documentation for=20
"foo", automarkup will just keep using the regular text font,
keeping the text untouched.

The reason is just because it was easier this way.=20

On the first patch, I used sed to replace structs on a=20
semi-automated way, checking the results.

at the second one, I addressed the remaining symbols manually.

Anyway, at the new version, I just placed everything related
to fscript.rst at the same patch, to make easier to review.

Yes, it was intentional. On almost all other docs documents I reviewed or
converted, they say "struct" instead of "a struct".

At the second version, I did the replacement on a consistent way.

Done. At the new patch I posted, none of the lines touched by the
patch uses more than 70 columns.

You may notice that I opted to keep "struct foo" at the same line.
This is not a mandatory requirement for automarkup.py to work, but
I would recommend keeping them at the same line, as, if someone tries to
do something like:

	$ git grep "struct foo" Documentation/

It would be able to find them.


Thanks,
Mauro
