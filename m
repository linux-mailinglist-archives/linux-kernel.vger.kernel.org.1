Thanks for the clarification. When I said latest, I meant including
your patch in the mailing list.

I agree. I was just suggesting to document this bug :).

Personally, I am fine with that. However, there were few concerns in the pa=
st.
I am leaving it to Palmer to decide.

@Palmer Dabbelt : Any thoughts ?

Yes.

I was suggesting to add a risc-v specific booting document and
document this "bug".
Documentation/riscv/boot-image-header.rst can be linked from that document =
or
the boot hader content can be included in that. No changes in code is neces=
sary.

Eventually, this booting document will also include other additional
booting constraints for RISC-V
such as minimum extension required to boot Linux, csr state upon
entering S-mode, mmu state.
