Subject: FBI and NSA Recommend Updating Your Linux System to Kernel 
Version 3.7 or Later

Good day from Singapore,

Please refer to the following news article and cybersecurity advisory.

Article: FBI and NSA expose new Linux malware Drovorub, used by Russian 
state hackers

https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-and-nsa-expose-new-linux-malware-drovorub-used-by-russian-state-hackers/

QUOTE:

"To prevent attacks, the agency recommends that US organizations update 
any Linux system to a version running kernel version 3.7 or later, "in 
order to take full advantage of kernel signing enforcement," a security 
feature that would prevent APT28 hackers from installing Drovorub's 
rootkit."
