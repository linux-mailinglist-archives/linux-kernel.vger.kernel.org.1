There is a lot behind that, so to get a complete detail of the event
sequence I would recommend looking at Section Vol. 2D 6.2.3 (pg Vol. 2D
6-5/ pdf pg 2531), 6.3 GETSEC[ENTERACCS](pg 6-10 Vol. 2D/pdf pg 2546),
and 6.3 GETSEC[SENTER](pg Vol. 2D 6-21/pdf pg 2557) in the Intel SDM[1].
Section 6.2.3 gives a slightly detailed overview. Section
GETSEC[ENTERACCS] details the requirements/procedures for entering AC
execution mode and ACRAM (Authenticated CRAM) and section GETSEC[SENTER]
will detail requirements/procedures for SENTER.

To answer you additional questions I would say if you look at all the
work that goes into protecting the ACM execution, why would you want to
then turn around and have it use memory outside of the protected region.
On the other hand, you are right, if the Developer's Guide says it
doesn't need to be protected and someone somehow finds a way to cause a
failure in the ACM through the use of a log outside of CRAM, then
rightfully that is a bug in the ACM. This is why I asked about making it
configurable, paranoid people could set the configuration to use the
heap and all others could just use an external location.

This is because the log buffer allocation was made the responsibility of
the pre-launch environment, in this case GRUB, and is communicated to
the ACM via the os_to_mle structure.

>=20

Actually yes we will want to do that because when we move to enabling
relaunching, an implementation may want to preserve the log from the
last launch before triggering the new launch which will result in a
reset of the DRTM PCRs and an overwriting the log.
