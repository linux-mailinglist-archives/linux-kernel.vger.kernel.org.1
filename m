So you want us to take a one-off char-driver kernel code for a closed
source userspace application for a public spec?  That feels really
really odd, if not actually against a few licenses.  I hate to ask it,
but are your lawyers ok with this?

I asked a bunch of questions about this in the patches themselves, you
all need to document the heck out of it everywhere you can, otherwise we
can't even review the code properly.  Could you review it without
knowing what userspace is supposed to be doing?

But, note, I will not take a spec-compliant driver that requires closed
source userspace code, nor should you even want me to do that if you
rely on Linux.

So please, release the userspace code, as it's going to have to be
changed anyway as your current user/kernel api is broken/incorrect
as-is.  Why not just bundle it in the kernel tree like we have the usbip
code?  That way you know it all works properly, and better yet, it can
be tested and maintained properly over time.

thanks,
