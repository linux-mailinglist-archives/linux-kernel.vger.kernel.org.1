It's an x86 patch as it's not KVM specific, e.g. this code also helps play
nice with out of tree hypervisors.

The code change is mostly good, but it needs to be split up as there are
three separate fixes:

  1. Handle #UD on VMXON due to a race.
  2. Mark memory and flags as clobbered by VMXON.
  3. Change emergency_vmx_disable_all() to not manually check cpu_vmx_enabled().

Yes, the changes are tiny, but if for example #3 introduces a bug then we
don't have to revert #1 and #2.  Or perhaps older kernels are only subject
to the #1 and #2 and thus dumping all three changes into a single patch makes
it all harder to backport.  In other words, all the usual "one change per
patch" reasons.
