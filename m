Since the max length a bootloader can accept for kernel command line arguments is finite (e.g.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1239170 ), we can't specify as many arguments as
we want. Since Linus is expecting to specify independently upon boot, length for the kernel
command line arguments might exceed that limit. The boot config is a method for allowing longer
kernel command line arguments, at the cost of mandating use of the initramfs file.

OK.

Build-time switching can support all users and setups, for the kernel is built for intended
environment/purpose only. Assuming that this feature is useful for any linux kernel fuzzing,
we need to care about whether we can specify longer kernel command line arguments on every
environment in order to support boot-time switching.

But there will be bugs which could not be found unless we twist kernel behavior.
Not mandate specifying appropriate twist options to the kernel command line
arguments can prevent automated/manual testings from finding/reproducing bugs.

If use of initramfs cannot be mandated, we might fail to specify necessary
twist options to the kernel command line (due to length limitation).

Neither do I. I'm not familiar with bootloaders.

This is an approach for embedding twist options into build-time conditions in order to
compensate for lack of ability to temporarily change the kernel command line arguments
(when it is difficult to temporarily change the kernel command line arguments).
