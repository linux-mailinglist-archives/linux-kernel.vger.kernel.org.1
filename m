Exactly, *some* (which AFAICT is a minority) might benefit. So why should
all the others pay the price for a functionality they do not need?

I don't think your change would actually cause a splat somewhere; my point
is about changing existing behaviour without having a story for it. The
thing said 'pick a "random" cpu', sure, but it never did that, it always
picked the first.

I've pointed out two examples that want to be cpumask_first(), and I'm
absolutely certain there are more than these two out there. What if folks
ran some performance test and were completely fine with the _first()
behaviour? What tells you randomness won't degrade some cases?

IMO the correct procedure is to keep everything as it is and improve the
specific callsites that benefit from randomness. I get your point that
using cpumask_any() should be a good enough indicator of the latter, but I
don't think it can realistically be followed. To give my PoV, if in the
past someone had used a cpumask_any() where a cpumask_first() could do, I
would've acked it (disclaimer: super representative population of sample
size = 1).

Flipping the switch on everyone to then have a series of patches "oh this
one didn't need it", "this one neither", "I actually need this to be the
first" just feels sloppy.

As you say, if someone wants smarter IRQ affinity they can do irq_balancer
and whatnot. The default kernel policy for now has been to shove everything
on the lowest-numbered CPU, and I see no valid reason to change that.
