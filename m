We have daily internal testing, although I don't expect you to take my 
word for that.

I would like to get one of these devices into the hands of Linaro, so 
that it can be put into KernelCI.  Similar to other Qualcomm products. 
I'm trying to convince the powers that be to make this happen.

Regarding what the community could do on its own, everything but the 
Linux driver is considered proprietary - that includes the on device 
firmware and the entire userspace stack.  This is a decision above my 
pay grade.

I've asked for authorization to develop and publish a simple userspace 
application that might enable the community to do such testing, but 
obtaining that authorization has been slow.

I'm curious, what information might you be looking for?  Are you 
concerned about the device attacking the host, or the host attacking the 
device?

So, you are looking for details about the messaging protocol which are 
considered opaque to the kernel driver?  Or something else?

Regarding access to documentation, sadly that isn't going to happen now, 
or in the near future.  Again, above my pay grade.  The only public 
"documentation" is what you can see from my emails.

I understand your position, and if I can "bound" the information you are 
looking for, I can see what I can do about getting you what you want. 
No promises, but I will try.

Can you clarify what you mean by "uAPI"?  Are you referring to the 
interface between the device and the kernel driver?
