Alexandru (Cc'd) has been rebasing and reworking Julien's patches, which
is my preferred approach.

I understand that's not quite ready for posting since he's investigating
some of the nastier subtleties (e.g. mutual exclusion with the NMI), but
maybe we can put the work-in-progress patches somewhere in the mean
time.

Alexandru, do you have an idea of what needs to be done, and/or when you
expect you could post that?

Thanks,
Mark.
