What I've had in mind is that if you want to delegate then you have an
option to add a layer where you pre define restrictions/guanratees so
that the delegated cgroup under that hierarchy cannot runaway. So
configuring high limit in a delegated cgroup should be reasonably safe.

Right but you can define a safe cap this way and leave the high
watermark for the delegated cgroup.
