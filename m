Agreed; we should be careful that any backported fix to an LTS kernel
does not increase the required Rust toolchain.

I expect in the short term that we will likely have a need for features
from recent stable releases, especially when those features were added
specifically to support the kernel or similar, but the rate at which we
need new features will slow over time, and eventually we'll go from
"latest stable" to "within a year or so".
