Did you not run checkpatch.pl on this?  :)

No need for change-id here.

But, most importantly, why is this in drivers/staging?  What keeps it
from being in the "real" part of the kernel?  I need a TODO file in the
directory of the driver listing what remains to be done and who is
responsible for doing this work and reviewing patches.

Can you resend this with that file added and the Change-id removed?

Also, why not just use the IIO interface, why are you creating
yet-another api for sensors?  We already have 2, making a third seems
like something that guarantees this will never be mergable to the
correct part of the kernel.

And finally, /proc/ is not for devices, that is what sysfs is for,
please use that.

thanks,
