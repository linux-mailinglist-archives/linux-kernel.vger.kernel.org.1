Well you can definitely crash the system this way -- undervolting can
result in all sorts of nice glitching. You might be able to even
programmatically undervolt to compromise the kernel in clever ways (a
lockdown bypass, I guess, but who cares).

That's why I initially suggested this was pretty squarely in the realm
of hobbyists and should just be added to that whitelist.
