I think I'm coming at this from a very different world than the one
you're thinking of.  The concept of a BSP makes me think of a SoC
vendor providing a drop of Linux with all their own weird hacks in it
that only ever works on that one SoC and will never, ever, ever be
updated.  5 years down the road if a software update is needed
(security fix?) some poor soul will be in charge of tracking down the
exact ancient code base that was used to build the original kernel,
making the tweak, and building a new kernel.  ;-)

In the world of Chrome OS we try very very hard to build everything
from a clean code base and are trying hard to stay even closer to
upstream and away from per-device weirdness...

Yeah, perhaps you're right.  When thinking about a laptop it's almost
always a fairly powerful device and things could certainly be
different for very low end chips trying to run Linux.

In the Chrome OS world I'm part of, the people supporting the boards
are not always the people adding new whizbang features.  We get new
versions of the OS every 6 weeks and those new versions may change the
way things work pretty significantly.  We ship those new versions off
to all boards.  Certainly they undergo testing, but there are a lot of
boards and if something is not tuned as well as it was when the device
first shipped it's likely nobody will really notice.  This is my bias
against needing per-board tuning.

Yeah.  I don't think I have enough skin in the game to really say one
way or the other what the API should be so I'll probably stay off the
other, bigger thread and let others decide what the best API should
be.  For Chrome OS I'd probably advocate just disabling the default
boost but even there I'd be willing to defer to the folks doing the
actual work.
