Initially i proposed just to go with GFP_NOWAIT flag. But later on there
was a discussion about a fallback path, that uses synchronize_rcu() can be
slow, thus minimizing its hitting would be great. So, here we go with a
trade off.

Doing it hard as __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL can do, is not worth(IMHO), but to have some
light-wait requests would be acceptable. That is why __GFP_NORETRY was proposed.

There were simple criterias we discussed which we would like to achieve:

a) minimize a fallback hitting;
b) avoid of OOM involving;
c) avoid of dipping into the emergency reserves. See kvfree_rcu: Use __GFP_NOMEMALLOC for single-argument kvfree_rcu()
