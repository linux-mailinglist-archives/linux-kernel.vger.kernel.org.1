So, that's a bigger hammer than I think is needed and punishes !BTI 
machines. I'm going to suggest that if we need to carry a temp patch its 
more like the glibc patch I mentioned in the Fedora defect. That patch 
simply logs a message, on the mprotect failures rather than aborting. 
Its fairly non-intrusive.

That leaves seccomp functional, and BTI generally functional except when 
seccomp is restricting it. I've also been asked that if a patch like 
that is needed, its (temporary?) merged to the glibc trunk, rather than 
just being carried by the distro's.

Thanks,
