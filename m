OK, after having had a second look, one thing we can perhaps address
with the last patch, or perhaps on top of that, is extending the
kprobes_blacklist() with data regions.

Because these patches only exclude kgdb from setting breakpoints on
code; data breakpoints do not match what we do with
arch_build_bp_info().
