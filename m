Right, this feature (allocation of unpopulated memory separated from
the balloon driver) is currently gated on CONFIG_ZONE_DEVICE, which I
think could be used on Arm.

IMO the right solution seems to be to subtract the physical memory
regions that can be used for the identity mappings of foreign pages
(all RAM on the system AFAICT) from iomem_resource, as that would make
this and the memory hotplug done in the balloon driver safe?

Thanks, Roger.
