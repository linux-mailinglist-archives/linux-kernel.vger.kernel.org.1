Hmm, rebooting with CR4.VMXE=1 shouldn't be a problem.  VMXON does all the
special stuff that causes problems with reboot, e.g. blocks INIT, prevents
disabling paging, etc...

That being said, I think it makes sense to keep the clearing of CR4.VMXE out
of paranoia as BIOS will be BIOS, and there is no real downside.  Not only
is the system about to reboot, but the CPUs that call cr4_clear_bits() from
NMI context are also being put into an infinite loop by crash_nmi_callback(),
i.e. they never leave NMI context.  And we rely on that behavior, otherwise
KVM could set CR4.VMXE and do VMXON after the NMI and the whole thing would
be for naught.
