Maybe, but it's easier said than done. The hard part is figuring how that
you have space and there's no way I'm touching that logic without a way to
test this.

I'm also not keen to complicate the code because of systems that don't scale
well with contended CAS [1]. If you put down loads of cores, you need an
interconnect/coherence protocol that can handle it.
