That's what is done on syscalls. There is success and exit where they both 
have different meaning sometimes but otherwise they agree.

We normally do not like to have fields that swing in and out because then its 
hard to know exactly what's in the event. When an event has different fields 
under special conditions, then we just say call it a new event. Split it into 
2 or 3 instead forcing it all into 1. And we also do not like fields that 
change meaning. Because then intepretation becomes hard. Or other people 
wishing to record the same info in another event have to follow the same 
pattern.

So, if you really need this field, the give some name like err_code or errno 
or anything not taken. And just fill it out every time. Its OK to be 0. If 
this only happens under some special operation, then make it a new event and 
fill it out only for that operation/event.
