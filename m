I'm personally be OK with something like:

#ifndef CONFIG_KGDB_ALLOW_UNSAFE_BREAKPOINTS
  if (within_kprobe_blacklist())
    ...
#endif

And then setup Kconfig so that KGDB_ALLOW_UNSAFE_BREAKPOINTS
defaults to n and add a extra check to put a warning in dmesg
that breakpoints are disabled.

I like kprobes very much... but not quite enough to want to
implement it on architectures I don't use ;-).
