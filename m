Thanks for providing the background reasoning.

I think that using weak symbols instead of macros to conditionally 
compile is fine. However, I still think that temporarily moving code 
that could be shared across architectures once the necessary back-end is 
implemented is not the right way. For instance, in the case of check(), 
it should be arch specific parts it relies on that should be weak 
symbols (e.g. arch_decode_instruction()).

And in order to have a correct list of supported subcommands, maybe that 
could be done in arch specific back end (e.g. arch_get_subcommand_set() 
), which would fill the array of subcommands for the target 
architecture. And you could have a default "weak" implementation that 
fills the array with subcommands that do not rely on any arch specific 
support.

This way we don't introduce #ifdef into the code and we don't move the 
generic code.

Might not be the prettiest option, but would it be a good enough 
compromise? Or are there other suggestions?

Thanks,
