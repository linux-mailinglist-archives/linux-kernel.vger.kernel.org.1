That is only if there is no ldisc set for the port, right?  I don't
think that always will be the case if the port is not initialized.

Yes, we do clear this on port open, but we clear it before the
->activate() callback happens.

Why not check for initialized instead?  That would seem to be what you
want to do here instead of checking for an io error.

We should probably check tty_port_initialized() on these code paths
better, care to fix that up?
