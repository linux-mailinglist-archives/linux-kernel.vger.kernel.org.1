It only uses trampolines on alpha, m68k, parisc, s390, and sparc32.  As
of today, the master branch should correctly enable executable stacks
on these and only these architecture.

I have a development branch that sets sa_restorer and disables
executable stacks on alpha, s390, and sparc32:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/klibc/klibc.git/log/?h=3Dexecstack-fixe=
s

But I haven't yet tested those changes other than on qemu-user.

The m68k and parisc kernel ports still don't support any alternatives
to trampolines for signal return, or they didn't when I reviewed this
a few months ago.
