Hi Dongjiu,

In the future, please use my kernel.org address, as I don't work
for ARM anymore, and would have missed this email if I wasn't pointed
to it.

No, that's not something I would ever consider, and for multiple
reasons:

- Linux only supports a single priority, meaning that interrupts are
   themselves aren't preemptable. Dealing with things like (pseudo) NMI
   is invasive enough, and I can't see a good reason to relax the
   single priority requirement.

- Building on top of the above, the whole scheduler and locking model
   relies on the non-preemptable property of an interrupt.

- I cannot see a good reason to leave the priority control to userspace.
   That's a sure recipe for userspace-controlled livelocks.

Now, I'm sure you want to introduce this for a reason, and you are not
explaining it ("some scenarios" doesn't quite cut it). If you care to
explain these "scenarios", maybe there is something we can do.

But please don't waste time implementing any sort of priority change,
there is no way I'll consider it as such.

Thanks,

         M.
