Thinking about this some more, I believe whether or not an IOCTL
interface is in the works or needed is irrelevant.  This patch
describes the hardware and how it is designed and the topic of
discussion is if we need a simple boolean state, or if we need
something that could be used to support dynamic configuration in the
future.  I would rather make this decision now rather than keep
tacking on boolean config options, or revisit a bunch of device-tree
changes.
