Hmm, I just noticed that there are actually *two* drivers (triflex.c
and pata_triflex.c) for this same device, and they both have this
comment about "APM BIOS refusing to suspend if IDE is not accessible"
and therefore preventing suspend of IDE.

At least, the comment seems to imply that calling pci_save_state() is
a way to prevent suspend of the device.  That seems like a strange way
to do it, but ...

Anyway, I wonder if a single quirk in drivers/pci/quirks.c would be
better.  A preliminary patch could add a quirk (keeping the comment)
and remove the pci_save_state() from both triflex_ide_pci_suspend()
and triflex_ata_pci_device_suspend().

Then you could proceed with these generic PM changes on top of that.

Maybe make the dev_info() mention that you're disabling PM to avoid an
APM BIOS suspend defect so users have a clue about why.
