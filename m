Oh, this is so obvious... in hindsight! :)

Walter, what do you think?

I would do this. I think latter stacks are generally more interesting
wrt shedding light on a bug. The first stack may even be "statically
known" (e.g. if object is always queued into a workqueue for some lazy
initialization during construction).
