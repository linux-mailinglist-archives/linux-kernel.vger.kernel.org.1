Okay, lets simplify things a bit and merge things slowly upstream and merge only
what is required right now.

IIUC, the only concern right now is to capture stats with fast switch ? Maybe we
can do something else in that case and brainstorm a bit..

Why is firmware the governor here ? Aren't you talking about the simple fast
switch case only ?

Over that, I think this cpufreq stats information isn't parsed by any tool right
now and tweaking it a bit won't hurt anyone (like if we start capturing things a
bit differently). So we may not want to worry about breaking userspace ABI here,
if what we are looking to do is the right thing to do.

I am not sure what notifications are we talking about here.

For the CPUs it would be better if we can keep things in cpufreq only, lets see
how we go about it.
