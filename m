I am perfectly fine with adding another cell which seems appropriate 
here. You can have 5 cells for all I care if that makes sense for 
the h/w. That has nothing to do with the Linux design. Whether Linux 
requires serializing mailbox accesses is a separate issue. On that side, 
it seems silly to not allow driving the h/w in the most efficient way 
possible.
