No, this is simply in the wrong place. The design here is that we pick 
up anything related to the basic SMMU IP (model) first, then make any 
platform-specific integration checks. That way a platform-specific init 
function can see the model impl set and subclass it if necessary 
(although nobody's actually done that yet). The setup for Cavium is just 
a short-cut since their model is unique to their integration, so the 
lines get a bit blurred and there's little benefit to trying to separate 
it out.

In short, put this down below with the other of_device_is_compatible() 
checks.

There was a notion that these would be grouped by vendor, but if there's 
a strong preference for all NVIDIA-SoC-related stuff to be named "Tegra" 
then I'm not going to complain too much.

On the other hand, a log prefix that is literally the name of a 
completely unrelated driver seems more confusing to users than useful. 
Same for the function naming - the tegra_smmu_* namespace is already 
owned by that driver.

Robin.
