BTW, you didn't even share 'good' vs 'bad' log for me to actually see
if the api lacks.

Let us look closely ...

This round trip took  67usecs.  (log shows some at even 3usecs)
That includes mailbox api overhead, memcpy and the time taken by
remote to respond.
So the api is definitely capable of much faster transfers than you require.

Here another request is started before the first is finished.
If you want this to work you have to serialise access to the single
physical channel and/or run the remote firmware in asynchronous mode -
that is, the firmware ack the bit as soon as it sees and starts
working in the background, so that we return in ~3usec always, while
the data returns whenever it is ready.  Again, I don't have the code
or the 'good' run log to compare.

PS: I feel it is probably less effort for me to simply let the patch
through, than use my reiki powers to imagine how your test code and
firmware looks like.
