Yes to all of the above.

Correct.

No, the intent argument is used (eventually) by SGX's ->mprotect()
implementation, i.e. sgx_mprotect() enforces that the actual protections are a
subset of the declared/intended protections.

If ->mprotect() is not merged, then it yes, it will be unused.  And therein
lies the problem as the kernel can't start using/enforcing the intent without
breaking userspace.  E.g. an enclave loaded with SGX_PROT_READ but mprotect()'d
with PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC would break if sgx_mprotect() came along.

One way to avoid introducing ->mprotect() would be to require all enclaves to
declare all pages with READ|WRITE|EXEC.  Then we could drop sgx_mprotect()
since the mprotect() permissions are guaranteed to be a subset of the declared
permissions.  That would have the added bonus of eliminating the per-page
checks in sgx_mmap()/sgx_mprotect(), though I've no idea if that is a
meaningful optmization or it's lost in the noise.

The big downside of requiring READ|WRITE|EXEC is that it will make life hell
for a LSM policy owner if they ever want to apply EXECMEM or EXECMOD style
restritions on enclaves, i.e. if SELinux folks want to add
security_enclave_load().

I find that I'm more or less ok with that approach, in no small part because
introducing security_enclave_load() might be a pretty big "if", e.g. security
folks may decide that they'd rather allow/deny enclaves based on the
measurement or signer of the enclave and eschew per-page checks entirely.
