Sound great!

From quick investigation, unfortunately, ZONE_DMA32 isn't available on
x86 32bit now so using GFP_DMA32 to allocate memory below 4G would not
work. Enabling ZONE_DMA32 on x86 32bit would be not simple, so, IMHO, it
would be better to leave the code as it is.

Nice! I already have seen your patch and found that above two lines
related to HIGHMEM are removed. Thanks for your help.

Thanks.
