Hi Eric,

This information is part in the first message of this mail thread.
The patch was intendedfor the active discussion in this thread,
not for a broad review.
A short summary: In the rt kernel, a panic in an interrupt context does
not start the dump-capture kernel, because there is a mutex_trylock in
__crash_kexe. If this is called in interrupt context, it always fails.
In the non-rt kernel calling mutex_trylock is not allowed according to
the comment of the function, but it still works.

I am not entirely sure what would happen here. But even if it gets in
some kind ofendless loop, I guess this is ok, because it allows finding
the problem. A piece of code in the function, that ensures the precondition
is a lot better than relying on only a comment.
If this was in mtex_trylock, the bug described above wouldn't have sneaked
in 12 years ago...

I would very much like that, but sadly it looks like it is not possible.
Either it wouldrequire blocking locks, that may fail, or not locking at
all, that may also fail.Using a different kind of lock (like spinlock)
is also not possible, becausespinlock_trylock again uses mutex_trylock
in the rt kernel.

Yes I also have the feeling, that the mutexes need fixing, but I wouldn't
to post any patch for that. At the moment, given the interface of the mutex,
this is clearly a bug in kexec, even if it works in the non-rt kernel.
