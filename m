The mux modelled by this binding is used by Guido with the NWL DSI
bridge integrated in the i.MX8. The NWL DSI is an IP core that has a
single input. The i.MX8 has an additional mux in front of the NWL DSI,
to select between the two display controllers in the SoC (eLCDIF and
DCSS). The mux doesn't belong to any of the display controller, it's
really glue logic between the display controllers and the NWL DSI
bridge.

I agree that the bindings shouldn't mention DRM. I would however prefer
not adding a mux-control property and multiple input ports to the NWL
DSI binding, as the mux isn't internal to that IP core (if we go that
route, we would need to add mux control to any IP core that would be
integrated in an SoC with a mux in front). As DT should describe the
hardware, I think describing the standalone mux between the display
controllers and the NWL DSI bridge makex sense.

We already have a DT binding for a video mux
(Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-mux.txt). From a DT point
of view, I see no reason not to reuse that. From a driver point of view
that will be messy, as the driver that binds to the video-mux compatible
string is part of V4L2. That's a driver issue however (and not a new
one, we already have devices that can be part of a video capture
pipeline or a video display pipeline), and should be solved on the
software side, not the DT side. It will however not be easy work, which
explains why, so far, everybody has ignored the issue hoping that
someone else would be hit by it first. We may have reached that day.
