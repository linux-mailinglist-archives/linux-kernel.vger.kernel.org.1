It's the GD test.

You're right, I need to cover both cases that trigger #DB.

No, the latest guest register is always in vcpu->arch.dr6.  It's only
because of KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT that kvm_update_dr6() needs to pass
vcpu->arch.dr6 to kvm_x86_ops.set_dr6.  Actually this patch could even
check KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT instead of vcpu->guest_debug.  I'll take a
look tomorrow.

Sort of, userspace can try to juggle host and guest debugging (this is
why you have KVM_GUESTDBG_INJECT_DB and KVM_GUESTDBG_INJECT_BP).

The patch is based on kvm/master, and indeed that line is from a bugfix
that I've posted yesterday ("KVM: SVM: fill in
kvm_run->debug.arch.dr[67]"). I had pushed that one right away, because
it was quite obviously suitable for 5.7.
