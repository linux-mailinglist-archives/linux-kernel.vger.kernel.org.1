When a thread in a non-trivial thread-group (sorry for the math
reference :)) execs it'll unshare its struct sighand. The new struct
sighand will be assigned using rcu_assign_pointer() so afaik (Paul or
Oleg can yell at me if I'm talking nonsense) any prior callers will see
the prior sighand value.

See above, I think that's impossible.
