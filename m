Hi,

Sorry for being slow with getting back to you on this.

Hmm, that is a bit hand-wavy, for an userspace ABI we really need to define
this clearly. Either it is integers (which is fine), or it is floats and we need
to define a decimal-separator as part of the ABI.

Note the reason why I started wondering about this in the first place is the
scalar_increment attribute. I think that can use some clarification too.

Regards,

Hans
