I wrote about that on some of the previous sets. The problem is that trace format is quite fixed. So it is lists are not
that easy to handle if you want to filter in them. You can have a trace event for each of them. You can also add
additional trace event "selinux_audied_permission" for each permission. With that you can filter out tclass or permissions.

But the basic thing we would like at the moment is a event that we can debug in user space.
