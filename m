Yeah, it might not make sense to add these checks all over the place.
The important part is that

1. There is a check somewhere (and if it's deep down in arch code)
2. There is an obvious way for callers to find out what valid values are.


I guess it would be good enough to

a) Factor out getting arch ranges into arch_get_mappable_range()
b) Provide memhp_get_pluggable_range()

Both changes only make sense with an in-tree user. I'm planning on using
this functionality in virtio-mem code. I can pickup your patches, drop
the superfluous checks, and use it from virtio-mem code. Makese sense
(BTW, looks like we'll see aarch64 support for virtio-mem soon)?
