Sorry, I missed the direction here, was too focused on the Case 5
aspect. Yes. Case 5 (which, again, I think we're about to re-document)
is only about *writing* to data within the page.

So in this case, where it is just reading from the page, I think it's
already from a gup vs pup point of view.

btw, it's not clear to me whether the current code is susceptible to any
sort of problem involving something writing to the page while it
is being dumped (I am curious). But changing from gup to pup wouldn't
fix that, if it were a problem. It a separate question from this patch.

(Souptick, if you're interested, the Case 5 documentation change and
callsite retrofit is all yours if you want it. Otherwise it's on
my list.)

thanks,
