No, definitely not. I was under the wrong impression that *kexec thing*
was more due to the client driver bugs rather than the SMMU.

Yes understood. I wrongly assumed that the kexec problem was more
of a client driver bugs rather than SMMU. But I see that we indeed
need to shutdown SMMU as any other driver.

Not my intention to break or remove kexec, hence the RFC tag :)
As for the consistent part, out of 18 iommu drivers only 5
have shutdown callbacks, so nothing much to remove there and
kexec is broken there probably. However I got your point and
will drop this patch.

Thanks,
Sai
