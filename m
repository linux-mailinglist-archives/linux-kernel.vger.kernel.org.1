As discussed on V4 patch 
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11753971/#23602723
The patch 4 is good to have, to make sure the UART_MANUAL_RFR is in 
ready state to receive the wakeup bytes.

Okay.

Ok, will modify the rationale.

yes, this is to prevent the BT chip from receiving garbage, will mention 
the same.

yes, we need pull-up on RX to prevent spurious wakeups, will modify this 
comment to mention it.
