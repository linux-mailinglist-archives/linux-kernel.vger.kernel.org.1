A regular down_read() caller will be handled normally.

Yes, that shouldn't be hard to do. If that is what is required, we may
only need a special upgrade function to drain the OSQ and then wake up
all the readers in the wait queue. I will add a flags argument to that
special upgrade function so that we may be able to select different
behavior in the future.

The regular down_read_interruptible() can be used unless we want to
designate only some readers are allowed to do upgrade by calling a
special down_read() function.

To be symmetric with the existing downgrade_write() function, I will
choose the name upgrade_read() for the upgrade function.

Will that work for you?
