 Does DAMON support virtual memory only?
 ========================================
 
-For now, yes.  But, DAMON will be able to support various address spaces
-including physical memory in near future.  An RFC patchset [1]_ for this
-extension is already available.  Please refer :doc:`plans` for detailed plan

+No.  DAMON supports the virtual memory address spaces and the physical memory
+address space for now.  However, it can be extended to support any address
+space, because the core logic of the DAMON can be configured with the low level
+primitives for each address space.
+
+In other words, DAMON provides the reference implementations of the low level
+primitives for the virtual memory address spaces and the physical memory
+address spaces.  The programming interface users can further implement their
+own low level primitives for their special use cases and configure those in
+DAMON if they need.

-Support Various Address Spaces
-==============================
-
-Currently, DAMON supports only virtual memory address spaces because it
-utilizes PTE Accessed bits as its low-level access check primitive and ``struct
-vma`` as a way to address the monitoring target regions.  However, the core
-idea of DAMON is in a separate higher layer.  Therefore, DAMON can support
-other various address spaces by changing the two low primitives to others for
-the address spaces.
-
-In the future, DAMON will make the lower level primitives configurable so that
-it can support various address spaces including physical memory.  The
-configuration will be highly flexible so that users can even implement the
-primitives by themselves for their special use cases.  Monitoring of
-clean/dirty/entire page cache, NUMA nodes, specific files, or block devices
-would be examples of such use cases.
-
-An RFC patchset for this plan is available [1]_.
