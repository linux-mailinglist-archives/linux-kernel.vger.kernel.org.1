Sure, though I will say that it works on all Chromebooks we've shipped
over the last ~9 years since the main cros_ec (EC = embedded
controller) driver does this.  Of course, it's easy to just change
that driver.  I just don't want everything else breaking too.


> How many drivers are doing that sequence?

I remember looking this up before but can't find it.  It's gonna be
hard to get an exact count without fancier searching, but we should be
able to find a few...  I'll just do the simple:

git grep -C10 enable_irq_wake | grep -C10 'disable_irq('

That might miss people but it'll catch quite a few.  Ones that are
clearly using something like this:

drivers/input/keyboard/adp5588-keys.c
drivers/input/keyboard/adp5589-keys.c
drivers/input/mouse/elan_i2c_core.c
drivers/input/rmi4/rmi_driver.c
drivers/input/touchscreen/elants_i2c.c
drivers/input/touchscreen/raydium_i2c_ts.c
drivers/mfd/as3722.c
drivers/mfd/max14577.c (*)
drivers/mfd/max77693.c
drivers/mfd/max77843.c
drivers/mfd/sec-core.c (*)
drivers/mfd/twl6030-irq.c
drivers/platform/chrome/cros_ec.c
drivers/power/supply/max17042_battery.c
drivers/rtc/rtc-st-lpc.c

(*) Even has a comment explaining why!

Input is perhaps over-represented but presumably that's because input
is often the thing that wakes devices up.  ;-)

I tried to put my thoughts back in:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAD=FV=WN4R1tS47ZzdZa_hsbvLifwnv6rgETVaiea0+QSZmiOw@mail.gmail.com/

...but that was a long thread.  Copied the relevant bits here.
Basically a driver that calls disablre_irq() together with
enable_irq_wake() is trying to say:

* Don't call the interrupt handler for this interrupt until I call
enable_irq() but keep tracking it (either in hardware or in software).
Specifically it's a requirement that if the interrupt fires one or
more times while masked the interrupt handler should be called as soon
as enable_irq() is called.

* If this interrupt fires while the system is suspended then please
wake the system up.

Specifically I think it gets back to the idea that, from a device
driver's point of view, there isn't a separate concept of disabling an
IRQ (turn it off and stop tracking it) and masking an IRQ (keep track
of it but don't call my handler until I unmask).  As I understand it
drivers expect that the disable_irq() call is actually a mask and that
an IRQ is never fully disabled unless released by the driver.  It is a
little unfortunate (IMO) that the function is called disable_irq() but
as far as I understand that's historical.

One case I can imagine: pretend that there are two power rails
controlling a device.  One power rail controls the communication
channel between the CPU and the peripheral and the other power rail
controls whether the peripheral is on.  At suspend time we want to
keep the peripheral on but we can shut down the power to the
communication channel.

One way you could do this is at suspend time:
  disable_irq()
  turn_off_comm_power()
  enable_irq_wake()

You'd do the disable_irq() (AKA mask your interrupt) because you'd
really want to make sure that your handler isn't called after you
turned off the communication power.  You want to leave the interrupt
pending/masked until you are able to turn the communications channel
back on and then you can query why the wakeup happened.

Now, admittedly, you could redesign the above driver to work any
number of different ways.  Maybe you could use the "noirq" suspend to
turn off your comm power or maybe you could come up with another
solution.  However, since the above has always worked and is quite
simple I guess that's what drivers use?
