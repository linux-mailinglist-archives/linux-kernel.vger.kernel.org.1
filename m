Sorry it took me a while to get around to these, but they're essentially good
with me.  There's some comments about needing ISA_C/c.li, but that's pretty
trivial.  In terms of mechanics: I don't really ever understand how to do these
multi-tree merges.  In an ideal world I'd like to have the arch/riscv/ stuff
stay in riscv/for-next, both because I don't want to deal with merge conflicts
and because that's where the RISC-V autobuilders look.

The best I can come up with is to split #3 up such that drivers/firmware/efi/
is its own patch and then send that up along with the PE header definitions
into an RC.  It'd be unused code at that point, but at least it'd break the
dependency between the trees and it'll be getting tested in riscv/for-next so
it won't rot.  We can ARMSTUB->GENERIC_STUB by just having the RISC-V support
select woth ARMSTUB and GENERIC_STUB, with a cleanup going in after everything
is merged.

That said, I'm happy if there's a better way to do this...
