This is also a reply to
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200514122038.GH3001@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net
-- the problem with __READ_ONCE would be solved with what Will
proposed above.

Let me try to spell out the requirements I see so far (this is for
KCSAN only though -- other sanitizers might be similar):

  1. __no_kcsan functions should not call anything, not even
kcsan_{enable,disable}_current(), when using __{READ,WRITE}_ONCE.
[Requires leaving data_race() off of these.]

  2. __always_inline functions inlined into __no_sanitize function is
not instrumented. [Has always been satisfied by GCC and Clang.]

  3. __always_inline functions inlined into instrumented function is
instrumented. [Has always been satisfied by GCC and Clang.]

  4. __no_kcsan functions should never be spuriously inlined into
instrumented functions, causing the accesses of the __no_kcsan
function to be instrumented. [Satisfied by Clang >= 7. All GCC
versions are broken.]

  5. we should not break atomic_{read,set} for KCSAN. [Because of #1,
we'd need to add data_race() around the arch-calls in
atomic_{read,set}; or rely on Clang 11's -tsan-distinguish-volatile
support (GCC 11 might get this as well).]

  6. never emit __tsan_func_{entry,exit}. [Clang supports disabling
this, GCC doesn't.]

  7. kernel is supported by compiler. [Clang >= 9 seems to build -tip
for me, anything below complains about lack of asm goto. GCC trivial.]

So, because of #4 & #6 & #7 we're down to Clang >= 9. Because of #5
we'll have to make a choice between Clang >= 9 or Clang >= 11
(released in ~June). In an ideal world we might even fix GCC in
future.

That's not even considering the problems around UBSan and KASAN. But
maybe one step at a time?

Any preferences?

Thanks,
-- Marco
