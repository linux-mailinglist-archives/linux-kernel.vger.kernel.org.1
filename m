In order to implement that, you'll need to extend the rseq per-arch
macros. Here is one I did for x86 (but not all other arch) which dereferences
a pointer, adds an offset that the resulting address, and loads the contents
of that memory location, all within a rseq critical section. See
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/librseq/librseq.git/tree/include/rseq/rseq-x86.h#n1292

int rseq_deref_loadoffp(intptr_t *p, off_t voffp, intptr_t *load, int cpu)

I did that following a discussion with Paul Turner about the requirements for the
rseq fence.

For the use-case you have in this example, you will probably want to create a new

int rseq_deref_offset_addv(intptr_t *p, off_t voffp, intptr_t count, int cpu)

Which dereferences the list pointer and adds an offset within the critical section,
and then increments the value at that memory location as a commit.

offsetof() is very useful to generate the voffp argument.

Thanks,

Mathieu
