I don't think it should be dependent on what specific shrinkers
free. There are other objects that may be RCU freed by shrinkers,
so it really shouldn't be applied just to specific shrinker
instances.

*nod*

The memory reclaim backoffs tend to be in the order of 50-100
milliseconds, though, so we are talking multiple grace periods here,
right? In which case, triggering a grace period expiry before a
backoff takes place might make a lot sense...

Ah. The need to allocate memory to free memory, and with that comes
the requirement of a forwards progress guarantee. It's mempools all
over again :P

Personally, though, designing functionality that specifically
requires memory allocation to free memory seems like an incredibly
fragile thing to be doing. I don't know the use case here, though,
but jsut the general description of what you are trying to do rings
alarm bells in my head...

So there's a reclaim recursion problem here, too?
