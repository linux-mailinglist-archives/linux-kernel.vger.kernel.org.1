Well, a fast large code model would solve a lot of problems :).  Unfortunately
we just don't have enough people working on this stuff to do that.  It's a
somewhat tricky thing to do on RISC-V as there aren't any quick sequences for
long addresses, but I don't think we're that much worse off than everyone else.
At some point I had a bunch of designs written up, but they probably went along
with my SiFive computer.  I think we ended up decided that the best bet would
be to distribute constant tables throughout the text such that they're
accessible via the 32-bit PC-relative loads at any point -- essentially the
multi-GOT stuff that MIPS used for big objects.  Doing that well is a lot of
work and doing it poorly is just as slow as PIC, so we never got around to it.

"PowerPC branch trampolines" points me here
https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.20/ld/PowerPC-ELF32.html .  That sounds
like what we're doing already in the medium code models: we have short and
medium control transfer sequences, linker relaxation optimizes them when
possible.  Since we rely on linker relaxation pretty heavily we just don't
bother with the smaller code model: it'd be a 12-bit address space for data and
a 21-bit address space for text (with 13-bit maximum function size).  Instead
of building out such a small code model we just spent time improving the linker.
