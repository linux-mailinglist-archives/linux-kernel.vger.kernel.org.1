UCI driver patch series includes following patches

1)   bus: mhi: core: Add helper API to return number of free TREs
2)   bus: mhi: core: Move MHI_MAX_MTU to external header file
3)   docs: Add documentation for userspace client interface
4)   bus: mhi: Add userspace client interface driver

mhi net driver can use  #1 and #2 and these two are part of MHI core 
driver change. These are helper API/macro which can be used by any mhi 
clients like UCI or mhi net dev.

#3 and #4 are MHI UCI character driver completely unrelated to netdev.

How about splitting the patch series between #1,#2 and #3, #4 and add 
netdev to #1, #2?

#1,#2 were already reviewed by two folks in community so it would be 
much easier for netdev folks to refer that in context of mhi net device 
driver.

Please let me know what do you think about this idea.

Thanks,
Hemant
