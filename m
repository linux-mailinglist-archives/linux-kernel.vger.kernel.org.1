It's not handwaving. When using cgroup features, including memory.high, the 
unit for consideration is a cgroup, not a task. That we happen to act on 
individual tasks in this case is just an implementation detail.

That one task in that cgroup is may be penalised "unfairly" is well within the 
specification: we set limits as part of a cgroup, we account as part of a 
cgroup, and we throttle and reclaim as part of a cgroup. We may make some very 
rudimentary attempts to "be fair" on a per-task basis where that's trivial, but 
that's just one-off niceties, not a statement of precedent.

When exceeding memory.high, the contract is "this cgroup must immediately 
attempt to shrink". Breaking it down per-task in terms of fairness at that 
point doesn't make sense: all the tasks in one cgroup are in it together.
