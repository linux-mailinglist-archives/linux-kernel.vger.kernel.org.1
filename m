Subject: [PATCH] drm/sun4i: mixer: Enable register value caching

It was discovered in the past by Ondrej Jirman that mixer register read
may occasionally return wrong value, most likely zero. It turns out
that all mixer units are affected by this issue. This becomes especially
obvious with applications like video player. After a few minutes of a
playback visual glitches appeared but not always in the same way. After
register inspection it was clear that some bits are not set even when
they should be.

Best solution would be to shuffle the code a bit to avoid
read-modify-write operations and use only register writes. However,
quicker solution is to enable caching support in regmap which is also
used here. Such fix is also easier to backport in stable kernels.
