Hi

The proposal is not just! It's bloat! Not directed at the problem!
Like ISO 9001 processes which were defined, but which were
circumvented/ignored by every single employee, for god reasons.

If the coding style document would explicite state function, names and
identifiers should be descriptive (it states this for helper
functions) the terms blacklist, master, slave would not be viable
names for anything in the kernel. Most Likely every racist wording
would be similarly excludend.
ie. black has descriptive proportion in coding/technical context, at
this point it's neither functional nor descriptive to the function a
list is used in. Same goes for master, slave and most likely every
racist connoted term.

Reference to african slavery denotes any other racist
behavior/background, which is racist itself.

So I would suggest,

1. to make a clear definition of how function, names and identifiers
should be formed.
so explicite promote the current "short descriptive functional terminology".
As far as I understand that is what linux implicitly expects today anyway.
This would make it easier for greenhorns like me to start contributing.

2.It could help to try to understand the coding style document, trying
to ignore any previous knowledge of linux programming. To my
understanding some paragraphs swallow half of the content.

3. make the maintainers reject every patch not conforming these rules,
except where it is needed for legacy/standard purpose.

4. explain just this is introduced to move away from inconsiderate
conoted racism terms. (1-2 sentence, IMHO) The rest belongs to COC.
The current draft focused to african american slavery is ill fated.
