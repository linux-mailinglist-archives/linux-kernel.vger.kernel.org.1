Yeah, I used the version from your tree.

Yeah, makes sense. After USB starts working, I'll try to write a
patch on the top of yours in order to use the schema he proposed.

For now, I'm trying to understand why the only two devices found
are the hub ones. Maybe the device is still in budget mode.

I have some cycles to spend on this. Just got a 960 board on my hands.
I guess I'll try to test your patches on the top of it.

Good point. Yeah, it doesn't sound hard to do that.

I'll try.

No, it is not power. The power supply for LDO17 (used on Hikey 970) is
enabled before this driver gets called (as there's a logic handling
EPROBE_DEFER on my patch).

It is starting to work, after a couple of hacks:

And the USB devices got disconnected afterwards:

[    7.020689] usb 1-1.1: reset low-speed USB device number 3 using xhci-hcd
[    7.020695] usb 1-1.1: hub failed to enable device, error -22
[    7.020765] usb 1-1.1: USB disconnect, device number 3
[    7.288840] usb 1-1.2: USB disconnect, device number 4

I tried force it to switch to host mode with:

	sudo su -c 'echo "device" > /sys/kernel/debug/usb/ff100000.dwc3/mode'
	sudo su -c 'echo "host" > /sys/kernel/debug/usb/ff100000.dwc3/mode'

But didn't work. What's weird is that the usb_role_switch_desc->set() ops 
is only called once, just after the USB hub driver is probed. 

Switching the mode later between host/device mode doesn't make any calls to
the USB hub driver.

I was able to drop it, but I had to add this at dwc3 settings:

	regulator-on-in-suspend;

As otherwise the device seems to stop a few seconds after the dwc3
driver gets started.

I suspect it could be related to those calls at the dwg3 driver:

	pm_runtime_use_autosuspend(dev);
	pm_runtime_set_autosuspend_delay(dev, DWC3_DEFAULT_AUTOSUSPEND_DELAY);

As this seems to be the only difference between what the dwc3 core
does and the dwc3-hisi doesn't do.

Thanks,
Mauro
