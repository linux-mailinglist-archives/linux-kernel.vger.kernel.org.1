Well, it is not just containers. It is also USB sticks. And people who
believe secure boot is good idea and try to protect kernel against
root. And crazy people who encrypt pointers in dmesg. And...

People want to use USB sticks from time to time. And while I
understand XFS is so complex it is unsuitable for such use, I'd still
expect bugs to be fixed there.

I hope VFAT to be safe to mount, because that is very common on USB.

I also hope ext2/3/4 is safe in that regard.

Anyway it would be nice to have documentation explaining this. If I'm
wrong about VFAT being safe, it would be good to know, and I guess
many will be surprised that XFS is using different rules.

Best regards,
