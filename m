Thank you for looking this over and for the feedback!

Good point on the sleeping.  My assumption has been that sleeping waiting
for a grace period was highly likely to allow memory to eventually be
freed, and that there is a point of diminishing returns beyond which
adding additional tasks to the reclaim effort does not help much.

Here are some strategies right offhand when sleeping is required:

1.	Always sleep in synchronize_rcu() in order to (with high
	probability) free the memory.  This might mean that the reclaim
	effort goes slower than would be good.

2.	Always sleep in the memory allocator in order to help reclaim
	along.	(This is a strawman version of what I expect your
	proposal really is, but putting it here for completeness, please
	see below.)

3.	Always sleep in the memory allocator in order to help reclaim
	along, but return failure at some point.  Then the caller
	invokes synchronize_rcu().  When to return failure?

	o	After some substantial but limited amount of effort has
		been spent on reclaim.

	o	When it becomes likely that further reclaim effort
		is not going to free up additional memory.

I am guessing that you are thinking in terms of specifying GFP flags to
result in some variant of #3.

Or am I missing a trick here?

							Thanx, Paul
