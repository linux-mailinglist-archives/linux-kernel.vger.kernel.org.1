Hm, not seeing anything about vblank worker below?

i915 has its own commit code, it's not even using the current commit
helpers (nor the commit_work). Not sure how much other fun there is.

Hm right, but I think we need at most 2 for commit thread and vblank
thread (at least with the current design). So open-coded if with two
if (prop == crtc_worker_pid_prop || prop  ==
crtc_vblank_worker_pid_prop) doesn't seem too horrible to me.
Otherwise people start creating really funny stuff in their drivers
with this backend, and I don't want to spend all the time making sure
they don't abuse this :-)

i915 uses highprio workqueue, so I guess to avoid regressions we need
that (it's also not using the commit helpers right now, but no reason
not to afaics, stuff simply happened in parallel back then.

drm_atomic_helper_commit_hw_done is what unblocks the next worker on
the same set of crtc. It's before we do all the buffer cleanup, which
has a full vblank stall beforehand. Most drivers also have the same
vblank stall in their next commit, plus generally the fb cleanup is
cheap, but neither is a requirement. So yeah you can get overlapping
commit work on the same crtc, and that was kinda intentional. Maybe
was overkill, I guess minimally just something that needs to be in the
commit message.
