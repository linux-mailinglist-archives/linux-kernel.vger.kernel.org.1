Sorry for my confusion!  I don't mean to say that our kernel
contributors are 'malicious' or some similar, and previously I have also
made mistakes and send buggy code into the kernel accidentally.
Also, we are trying to summarize the methods to efficiently auditing
patches to prevent potential issues in the patch.

agree : )

Okay, I see.

Thanks again for your patient reply, and apologies for my confusing description.
