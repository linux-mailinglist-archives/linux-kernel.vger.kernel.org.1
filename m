Is the `struct mhdp_platform_ops` a leftover from that? Can that be dropped?

I wonder how imx8 would best blend into this? First thing will likely be
to upstream the phy code in driveres/phy/ so a modified version of this bridge
driver could call into that, then go and look for common patterns.

I'm pretty sure they use different firmware though - the imx8mq
additionally supports HDMI with a different firmware on the same IP core
(13.4 and 13.5 in the imx8mq ref manual).

That would be great!
