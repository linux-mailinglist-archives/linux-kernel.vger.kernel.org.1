Do you have any details or pointers to documentation on said ability
to queue commands?  I don't think I've ever heard of it.

How exactly would it work, anyway?  There's no sequence number or
anything in GENI and there's a single "DONE" interrupt that signals
both "CS Done" and "Transfer Done", so without some really good docs
I'd have a really hard time figuring out how this is supposed to work.

Presumably every CS change takes the same amount of time?  ...so I'd
say "both".  If it really matters I can try to measure.

cs-gpios is a pretty normal Linux concept and not something I
invented.  It's documented to work just fine and I can't see this as
being a real problem.

Sigh.  I always make that typo.  I can spin if need be to fix.

I appreciate the tag, but I'm not sure it's working the way you're
thinking it does?  See:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-controller.yaml

From there, when you specify spi-gpios it's saying: definitely use
this GPIO as the chip select, don't use your native one.  The bindings
explicitly show how you would specify the native GPIO.

If we wanted the SPI controller to decide one way or the other on its
own, I guess we'd need an entirely new property saying that if it
wanted to control its chip select with GPIO then here's the GPIO and
then we'd need to provide a pinmux config for that.  That feels
overkill to me since I really see no reason not to use it as a GPIO.

It's kinda like saying: if an SoC provided two different ways to set a
pin, one of which always delayed 50 us to assert and one that asserted
instantly, do we really need to write drivers to support both modes?
No.  The mode which delays 50 us is useless and there was no good
reason for the SoC to invent that mode and no reason to try to support
it in software.

need to control the GPIO itself.  If we ever do come up with a reason
we can solve it then?
