Thanks Zi, for such a detailed explanation. Ideally, we should separate THP
migration from base page migration in terms of statistics. PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS
and PGMIGRATE_FAIL should continue to track statistics when migration starts
with base pages. But for THP, we should track the following events.

1. THP_MIGRATION_SUCCESS 	- THP migration is successful, without split
2. THP_MIGRATION_FAILURE 	- THP could neither be migrated, nor be split
3. THP_MIGRATION_SPLIT_SUCCESS  - THP got split and all sub pages migrated
4. THP_MIGRATION_SPLIT_FAILURE  - THP got split but all sub pages could not be migrated

THP_MIGRATION_SPLIT_FAILURE could either increment once for a single THP or
number of subpages that did not get migrated after split. As you mentioned,
this will need some extra code in the core migration. Nonetheless, if these
new events look good, will be happy to make required changes.
