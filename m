Thanks for the feedback, then I'll continue in this direction!

Agree.

It is true only if the io_uring istance is created with SQPOLL flag (not the
default behaviour and it requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN). In this case the
kthread is created and you can also set an higher idle time for it, so
also the waking up syscall can be avoided.

Sorry but I don't know seccomp that well :-(
I'm learning a lot about it these days. I'll keep your concern in mind.

Thanks,
