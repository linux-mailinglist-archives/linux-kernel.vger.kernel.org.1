fwiw, commit_work does sleep/block for some time until fences are
signalled, but then once that happens we want it to run ASAP,
preempting lower priority SCHED_FIFO.

Possibly, but we still have limited prioritization options (ie. not
enough) to set these from the kernel.  Giving userspace the control,
so it can pick sensible priorities for commit_work and vblank_work,
which fits in with the priorities of the other userspace threads seems
like the sensible thing.

I mean, the issue is that userspace is already using a few different
rt priority levels for different SF threads.  We want commit_work to
run ASAP once fences are signalled, and vblank_work to run at a
slightly higher priority still.  But the correct choice for priorities
here depends on what userspace is using, it all needs to fit together
properly.

The problem I was seeing was actually the opposite..  commit_work
becomes runnable (fences signalled) but doesn't get a chance to run
because a SCHED_FIFO SF thread is running.  (Maybe I misunderstood and
you're approach would help this case too?)

The SCHED_DEADLINE + token passing approach that the lwn article
mentioned sounds interesting, if that eventually becomes possible.
But doesn't really help today..
