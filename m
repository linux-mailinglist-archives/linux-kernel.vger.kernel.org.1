Subject: [PATCH v3 3/4] seccomp: notify about unused filter

We've been making heavy use of the seccomp notifier to intercept and
handle certain syscalls for containers. This patch allows a syscall
supervisor listening on a given notifier to be notified when a seccomp
filter has become unused.

A container is often managed by a singleton supervisor process the
so-called "monitor". This monitor process has an event loop which has
various event handlers registered. If the user specified a seccomp
profile that included a notifier for various syscalls then we also
register a seccomp notify even handler. For any container using a
separate pid namespace the lifecycle of the seccomp notifier is bound to
the init process of the pid namespace, i.e. when the init process exits
the filter must be unused.
If a new process attaches to a container we force it to assume a seccomp
profile. This can either be the same seccomp profile as the container
was started with or a modified one. If the attaching process makes use
of the seccomp notifier we will register a new seccomp notifier handler
in the monitor's event loop. However, when the attaching process exits
we can't simply delete the handler since other child processes could've
been created (daemons spawned etc.) that have inherited the seccomp
filter and so we need to keep the seccomp notifier fd alive in the event
loop. But this is problematic since we don't get a notification when the
seccomp filter has become unused and so we currently never remove the
seccomp notifier fd from the event loop and just keep accumulating fds
in the event loop. We've had this issue for a while but it has recently
become more pressing as more and larger users make use of this.

To fix this, we introduce a new "users" reference counter that tracks
any tasks and dependent filters making use of a filter. When a notifier is
registered waiting tasks will be notified that the filter is now empty by
receiving a (E)POLLHUP event.
The concept in this patch introduces is the same as for signal_struct,
i.e. reference counting for life-cycle management is decoupled from
reference counting taks using the object.

There's probably some trickery possible but the second counter is just
the correct way of doing this imho and has precedence. The patch also
lifts the waitqeue from struct notification into sruct seccomp_filter.
This is cleaner overall and let's us avoid having to take the notifier
mutex since we neither need to read nor modify the notifier specific
aspects of the seccomp filter. In the exit path I'd very much like to
avoid having to take the notifier mutex for each filter in the task's
filter hierarchy.

/* v2 */
- Jann Horn <jannh@google.com>:
  - Use more descriptive instead of seccomp_filter_notify().
    (I went with seccomp_filter_release().)

/* v3 */
- Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>:
  - Rename counter from "live" to "users".
