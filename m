It would be quite daring to claim it will be ok but it will certainly be
less problematic. Adding the flag will not hurt in any case. As this is
a shared called that might be called from many contexts I think it will
be safer to have it there. The justification is that it will prevent
consumption of memory reserves from MEMALLOC contexts.

It doesn't matter all that much. Both allocators will work. It is just a
matter of using optimal tool for the specific purose.

alloc_pages will return struct page but you need a kernel pointer. That
is what __get_free_pages will give you (or you can call page_address
directly).

Yes, looks good to me. I am not entirely sure about the fragmentation
argument. It really depends on the SL.B allocator internals. The same
applies for the potential speed up. I would be even surprised if the
SLAB was faster in average considering it has to use the page allocator
as well. So to me the primary motivation would be "use the right tool
for the purpose".
