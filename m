Yes and this one should be cached at topology buildup

For now, we should probably skip the additional test above: "if
(wake_flags & WF_TTWU) {" and keep SD_BALANCE_WAKE so we will continue
to loop in case of !want_affine.

We can imagine that we might want at the end to be a bit more smart
for SD_BALANCE_WAKE and the slow path... like with the latency nice
proposal and latency-nice=19 as a example
