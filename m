Subject: [RFC PATCH kernel] serial_core: Check for port state when tty is in error state
Date:   Tue, 28 Jul 2020 22:43:59 +1000

At the moment opening a serial device node (such as /dev/ttyS3)
succeeds even if there is no actual serial device behind it.
Reading/writing/ioctls (most) expectantly fail as the uart port is not
initialized (the type is PORT_UNKNOWN) and the TTY_IO_ERROR error state
bit is set fot the tty.

However syzkaller (a syscall fuzzer) found that setting line discipline
does not have these checks all the way down to io_serial_out() in
8250_port.c (8250 is the default choice made by univ8250_console_init()).
As the result of PORT_UNKNOWN, uart_port::iobase is NULL which
a platform translates onto some address accessing which produces a crash
like below.

This adds tty_io_error() to uart_set_ldisc() to prevent the crash.

The example of crash on PPC64/pseries:

While looking at it, I noticed that a bunch of callbacks are prone to
this bug and since I wanted to fix them all with minimum effort,
I tried checking for PORT_UNKNOWN in uart_port_check() but it breaks
device opening. Another approach could be checking for uart_port::iobase
in 8250 (and probably uart_port::membase as well) but this will make
the rest of the code to think the device is ok while there is no device
at all.

What would the correct approach be and what is the expectation?

The fact that /dev/ttyS3 opened in the first place is confusing already.
