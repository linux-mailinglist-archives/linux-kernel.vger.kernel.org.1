This is changing only arm64 for now. For fun, looked at some arm32 DTS:
arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed-g6.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2836.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos4210.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos4412.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/highbank.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/imx7ulp.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/ls1021a.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/meson6.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/meson8.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/meson8b.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/milbeaut-m10v.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk322x.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3288.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/rtd1195.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/rv1108.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/ste-dbx5x0.dtsi

These have random non-zero values in Aff1 or Aff2. I may have generated
some false positives with simple search.
