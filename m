Note that we still must try to append the continuous piece into the
same data block. We could not concatenate them in the reader API
because it would create the problem with unused/skipped sequence numbers.

Also it would complicate the reader code. It would need to know
whether a record has already been printed together with a previous
one.

This is a real problem. And it is the reason why the cont buffer is
currently flushed (finalized) by the next message from another context.

Yeah, it would be possible.

Anyway, this would fix an already existing problem. It might get
complicated and tricky. I am afraid that it comes from the "perfection
is the enemy of good" department.

A good compromise might be to just store "loglevel" from the previous
message in the given context. It could then be used for pr_cont()
messages in the same context.

Anyway, I would solve this later because it is already existing
problem.
