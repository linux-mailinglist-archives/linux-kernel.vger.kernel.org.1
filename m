Agree, load balance will try to spread the load across the quads. In my hack,
I was explicitly marking QUAD domains as !SD_PREFER_SIBLING + relaxing few
load spreading rules when SD_PREFER_SIBLING was not set. And this was on a
slightly older kernel (without recent Vincent's load balance overhaul).

Very interesting.

I detect if the LLC is shared at BIGCORE, and if they are shared at BIGCORE,
then I dynamically rename the DOMAIN as CACHE and enable
SD_SHARE_PKG_RESOURCES in that domain.

Thanks for the pointer.
