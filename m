I read this today, 
https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Microsoft-DX12-WSL2

Microsoft Announces Direct3D 12 for Linux / WSL2.

Games can pull a lot of people, and maybe that is what one needs as the 
final push, to make an Ubuntu Karmic Koala distro work.

+ Seam + 0.33ms latency Renoise + Low Jitter Config Kernel 72.7 (x3pass) 
Doom 3, I think one can really show what "Linux" can do, and establish a 
standard. Mac OS also now *nix, and Microsoft is getting in on the act.

An €-money integration is sure to happen, and EU is optimally located 
for it, as symbolicness can be in pop-worlds.

If still distro guidance should be needed by me, I have now called my 
system Xyr O-S.

Serene Greetings,
Ywe Cærlyn
