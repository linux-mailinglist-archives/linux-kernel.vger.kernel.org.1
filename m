I was referring to 1) And I still think that an application that 
*relies*
on handshakes working should configure the handshakes, even if POSIX
promises they should be set up.

A person might have done that, a company will probably just not support
Linux or do a redesign with a different solution.

Or use your option 3) mentioned below: open with O_DIRECT, use ioctl to
set the sticky flag and close before starting the application.

Option 3) looks best to me.
