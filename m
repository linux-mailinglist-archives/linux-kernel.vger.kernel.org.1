Good point. Even the "do_not_print_to_consoles" flag might cause
loosing other important messages on consoles. It is because all
consoles are handled in a single loop.

The asynchronous consoles would use one kthread per console. It would
allow to see all messages at least by fast consoles and userspace.

The OOM problem will also be solvable with a bigger log buffer.
It would all to keep the entire dump until it can be seen on
consoles or stored by userspace. The asynchronous consoles will
prevent blocking OOM killer which is the primary problem.

This is much more complicated than the vsprintf(NULL) approach.

It might get more complicated if you would actually want to see
pr_debug() messages for a selected module in the fuzzer.

vsprintf(NULL, ) can be called for pr_debug() messages in
vprintk_store(). It will be again only a single place for
all printk() wrappers.
