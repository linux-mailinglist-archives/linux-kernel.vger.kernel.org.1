Nope, drm_panel_add only makes the panel visible to other drm drivers,
not yet to userspace. That only happens once the overall drm driver
calls drm_dev_register. At that point the mipi_dsi_attach should have
happened I think.

That in turn calls a drm_connector_funcs->late_register hook, which is
meant to be use to register stuff like backlight interfaces. If you
set up your backlight before that, yes I expect some good fireworks.
Now as you noticed, we're not wiring that through to panels, so maybe
the best solution would be if drm_panel gets a backlight pointer with
an initialized, but not yet registered backlight. And then we can
drive this in the bridge or connector wrapper for panels.

Or I'm totally not understanding the issue even, which is also possible :-)
