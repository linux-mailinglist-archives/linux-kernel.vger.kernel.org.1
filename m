But IMO they're not unrelated if they end up in __vdso_sgx_enter_enclave().
Getting to the point where __vdso_sgx_enter_enclave() actually attempts
ENCLU (the single fixup entry) requires a very deliberate attempt to run an
enclave.  Not to mention the fixup doesn't squash the fault, it simply
morphs what would be a signal into a synchronous error.

And I don't see how to sanely track this in task_struct.  As stated before,
the only foolproof way to identify an SGX task is by tracking whether it
has a VMA backed by /dev/sgx/enclave, i.e. the flag would probably need to
reside in mm_struct.  Keying off opening /dev/sgx/enclave isn't viable as
enclaves can be handed off via SCM_RIGHTS or fork().

Putting a flag in mm_struct is doable, but it would need to be sticky to
keep things sane, e.g. clearing the flag on unmapping the enclave would
require refcounting VMAs and hooking vm_ops->close.  The refcounting is
painful (we had it for several years) and ->close prevents merging VMAs,
which IMO is far worse than unconditionally morphing fault-based signals
that originate in __vdso_sgx_enter_enclave().  And assuming we don't do the
whole ->close thing, we'd end up with MADV_DONTFORK -> fork() having
divergent behavior for mm_structs without /dev/sgx/enclave VMAs, i.e. the
child of MADV_DONTFORK -> fork() case would not be tagged SGX (unless we
intentionally do the "wrong" thing and propagate the flag), whereas the
munmap() case would result in a SGX-tagged mm_struct with no
/dev/sgx/enclave VMAs.
