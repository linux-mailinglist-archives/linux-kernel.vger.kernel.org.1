Wouldn't the former actually cause problems, because the closest
frequency the clock driver can support could be pretty far from the
one requested? (E.g. 19.2 MHz vs 24 MHz) The driver needs to check the
resulting frequency anyway.

Perhaps a simplified approach of rounding the result of clk_get_rate()
to a multiple of 100 KHz and comparing it to the hardcoded value would
be enough in practice?
