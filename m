The details of the environment that we found the problem are as follows:

  total driver tags: 128
  number of disks: 13 (network drive, and they form a dm-multipath)
  default queue_depth: 32
  disk performance: when test with 4k randread and single thread, iops is
                    300. And can up to 4000 with 32 thread.
  test cmd: fio -ioengine=psync -numjobs=32 ...

We found that mpath will issue sg_io periodically(about 15s)£¬which lead
to active_queues setting to 13 for about 5s in every 15s.

By the way, I'm not sure this is a common scenario, however, sq don't
have such problem,

Thanks
Yu Kuai
