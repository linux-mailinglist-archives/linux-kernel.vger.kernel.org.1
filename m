Hi Linus,

please pull the sched/urgent pile. I had to rebase it last-minute ontop
of -rc2 because it was based on a random merge commit after -rc2 and I
know you don't like pull requests based on random commits if there's not
a real reason for that.

Peter and I did try to look for a real reason but the commits
which were between the -rc2 tag and the merge commit were three
regulator/regmap/spi pulls which don't have anything to do with sched.
Which led us to conclude that those patches were erroneously rebased on
the state of your master branch at the time.

A quick build and boot smoke tests showed too that those changes are
unrelated.

 ( Btw, the rebase was done to fix up the SOB chain in a commit and trim
   a commit message. )

So yeah, I know, we should not rebase stuff but considering the above,
I guess that's ok in this case as the history cleanliness is more
important here. I could be missing an important aspect, though...

Thx.

  sched/cfs: change initial value of runnable_avg (2020-06-28 17:01:20 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Zijlstra says:

The most anticipated fix in this pull request is probably the horrible build
fix for the RANDSTRUCT fail that didn't make -rc2. Also included is the cleanup
that removes those BUILD_BUG_ON()s and replaces it with ugly unions.

Also included is the try_to_wake_up() race fix that was first triggered by
Paul's RCU-torture runs, but was independently hit by Dave Chinner's fstest
runs as well.
