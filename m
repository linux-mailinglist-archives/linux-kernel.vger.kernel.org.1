Maybe in an SEV or Secure Boot environment we can assume the VM guest
OS uses the IOMMU exclusively for DMA, but otherwise the IOMMU is
optional (at least for x86, other archs do require IOMMU support
afaik).  Therefore, how would we know which pages to pin when there are
only limited configs where we might be able to lean on the vIOMMU to
this extent?  Thanks,

Alex
