OK, I would change the implementation to platform driver if there is no
other voice.

I thought about probing raw events by SBI extension too, I'm interested if you
have more detail about this.

It seems to me that it is a little bit hard to return all events
through one SBI call,
so I thought we could map the generic hardware events and maintain their own
raw events by each platform in OpenSBI. But eventually, I thought the
DT mechanism
is more clear and easy than that. Let me know if you have any ideas about
probe function. Thanks.
