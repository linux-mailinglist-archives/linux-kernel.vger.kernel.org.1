Correct. attr:config2 identifies the "sink" for the collection. But,
that doesn't solve the problem we have here. If two separate perf
sessions use the "same sink", we don't want to mix the
trace data into the same sink for events from different sessions.

Thus, we need a way to check if a new event starting the tracing on
an ETM belongs to the same session as the one already pumping the trace
into the sink.

We use event->owner pid for this check and thats where we encountered
a NULL event->owner. Looking at the code further, we identified that
kernel events could also trigger this issue.
