OK, I see but why does the subsequent reclaim attempt makes a forward
progress? Is this just because dirty pages are flushed in the mean time?
Because if this is the case then the underlying problem seems to be that
the reclaim should be throttled on dirty data.

Right but there is no way to indicate that the reclaim has failed when
writing to memory.high.

I am not sure what you are asking here.
