I don't think your proposed mitigation would work with much
reliability against this bug; the attacker has full control over the
timing of the original use and the following use, so an attacker
should be able to trigger the kmem_cache_free(), then spam enough new
VMAs and delete them to flush out the quarantine, and then do heap
spraying as normal, or something like that.

Also, note that here, if the reallocation fails, the kernel still
wouldn't crash because the dangling object is not accessed further if
the address range stored in it doesn't match the fault address. So an
attacker could potentially try multiple times, and if the object
happens to be on the quarantine the first time, that wouldn't really
be a showstopper, you'd just try again.

I think that here, again, the free() and the dangling pointer use were
caused by separate syscalls, meaning the attacker had control over
that timing?

Haven't looked at that one in detail.

Well, not necessarily "predetermined". Depending on the circumstances,
you don't necessarily need to know which address you're writing to;
and you might not even need to overwrite a specific object, but
instead just have to overwrite one out of a bunch of objects, no
matter which.

Yeah; and that behavior is pretty critical for performance. The longer
it's been since a newly allocated object was freed, the higher the
chance that you'll end up having to go further down the memory cache
hierarchy.

The vmacache exploit you linked to doesn't do that, it frees the
object all the way back to the page allocator and then sprays 4MiB of
memory from the page allocator. (Because VMAs use their own
kmem_cache, and the kmem_cache wasn't merged with any interesting
ones, and I saw no good way to exploit the bug by reallocating another
VMA over the old VMA back then. Although of course that doesn't mean
that there is no such way.)

Those numbers are fairly big. At that point you might not even fit
into L3 cache anymore, right? You'd often be hitting DRAM for new
allocations? And for many slabs, you might end using much more memory
for the quarantine than for actual in-use allocations.

It seems to me like, for this to stop attacks with a high probability,
you'd have to reserve a huge chunk of kernel memory for the
quarantines - even if the attacker doesn't know anything about the
status of the quarantine (which isn't necessarily the case, depending
on whether the attacker can abuse microarchitectural data leakage, or
if the attacker can trigger a pure data read through the dangling
pointer), they should still be able to win with a probability around
quarantine_size/allocated_memory_size if they have a heap spraying
primitive without strict limits.

These numbers seem really high for a mitigation, especially if that
performance hit does not really buy you deterministic protection
against many bugs.

But you are pretty much inherently limited in terms of performance by
the effect the quarantine has on the data cache, right?

It seems to me like, if you want to make UAF exploitation harder at
the heap allocator layer, you could do somewhat more effective things
with a probably much smaller performance budget. Things like
preventing the reallocation of virtual kernel addresses with different
types, such that an attacker can only replace a UAF object with
another object of the same type. (That is not an idea I like very much
either, but I would like it more than this proposal.) (E.g. some
browsers implement things along those lines, I believe.)
