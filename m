Obviously.  But you keep ignoring event queue overflows; it's
basically guaranteed to happen with a sizable mount storm and then you
are back to O(n^2).

Give it some testing please, as Linus is not going to take any
solution without an actual use case and testing.  When you come back
and say that fsinfo(2) works fine with systemd and a 100k mount/umount
storm, then we can have a look at the performance budget and revisit
the fine points of API design.

Thanks,
Miklos
