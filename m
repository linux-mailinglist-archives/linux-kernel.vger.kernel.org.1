Yeah, looks like it.

Hmm, looks like this doesn't generally work then. :-/

An alternative would be to check if '__noinstr_text_start <= _RET_IP_
< __noinstr_text_end' in __sanitizer_cov-functions and return if
that's the case. This could be #ifdef'd when we get a compiler that
can do __no_sanitize_coverage. At least that way we get working KCOV
for now.

Would that work?
