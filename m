It does appear that the APIC hardware or some other component does not reset
something and assumes the power up value is 0.

Too bad proper voltage monitoring/full reset is not in place.

I was just reporting the issue as instructed by the kernel panic.
I think the issue is avoided by leaving the system powered off longer.
