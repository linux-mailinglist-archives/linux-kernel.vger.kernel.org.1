I will keep this in mind. We _may_ get some interns this year who
_may_ be interested in fixing Linux kernel bugs (but otherwise
extending syzkaller descriptions).

FTR, there is also some follow up on twitter re extending
https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check to capture such
recommendations:
