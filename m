Yes, correct. After Stephen's comment on the Venus DVFS series that he
dropped the message I realized why I don't see the TCS Busy anymore.

The runtime_suspend in venus driver will not happen too often, but
dev_pm_opp_set_rate could be called on every decoded/encoded frame (we
have so called dynamic clock scaling depending on the input bitstream).

In any case, you gave me more material to think of.
