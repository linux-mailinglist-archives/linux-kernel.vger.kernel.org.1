Outside of the now infamous memcpy_mcsafe() any kernel consumption
of poison results in a panic as the mce_severity() code will trip
this case:

        MCESEV(
                PANIC, "Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel",
                SER, MASK(MCI_STATUS_OVER|MCI_UC_SAR|MCI_ADDR|MCACOD, MCI_UC_SAR|MCI_ADDR|MCACOD_DATA),
                KERNEL
                ),

We don't see this particular problem on baremetal because a CLFLUSH
instruction isn't *consuming* data. It's just evicting things from
the cache to memory. So we reference the virtual address, which works
fine on baremetal because the kernel 1:1 map is still active. But in
the guest case the guest physical address has gone away. So we trap
to the VMM.

That question only makes any sense if you know you are running as a
guest and that someone else has unmapped the address. It's a meaningless
question to ask if you are running bare metal. So we'd still have a check
for FEATURE_HYPERVISOR

Maybe it isn't pretty. But I don't see another practical solution.

The VMM is doing exactly the right thing here. It should not trust
that the guest will behave and not touch the poison location again.
If/when the guest does touch the poison, the right action is
for the VMM to fake a new machine check to the guest.

Theoretlcally the VMM could decode the instruction that the guest
was trying to use on the poison page and decide "oh, this is that
weird case in Linux where it's just trying to CLFLUSH the page. I'll
just step the return IP past the CLFLUSH and let the guest continue".

But that doesn't sound at all reasonable to me (especially as the
next step is to realize that Linux is going to repeat that for every
cache line in the page, so you also want to VMM to fudge the register
contents to skip to the end of the loop and avoid another 63 VMEXITs).

N.B. Linux wants to switch the page to uncacheable so that in the
persistant memory case the filesytem code can continue to access
the other "blocks" in the page, rather than lose all of them. That's
futile in the case where the VMM took the whole 4K away. Maybe Dan
needs to think about the guest case too.
