We did present entropy reduction over time for Chrome (see Fig. 8).
But without a proper sliding primitive due to mmap() randomization, we
stopped at 2 bits of residual entropy. Getting the last 2 bits is not
impossible, but indeed slower. Not sure by how much without actually
trying (as mentioned, you might also be able to use other side
channels to compensate).

I forgot to mention that mmap() randomization actually makes attacks
easier in cases where VMAs are not demand paged (see Section VI.B of
the AnC paper), since proper sliding with nonrandomized mmap() would
otherwise need to allocate too much memory.

Indeed it's nontrivial to get similar randomization guarantees for the
kernel. I mentioned TagBleed because similar combined AnC + TLB
attacks should also be possible in the browser. We just happened to
focus on the kernel with TagBleed.

Indeed my example above assumed pointers between VMAs. At each step,
you would use a vulnerability to craft a counterfeit object around
existing pointers to other VMAs and move from there.

Note that without existing pointers between VMAs, you can still mount
similar attacks by crafting your own pointers to probe for other VMAs.
Since you'd be blindly probing the address space, you'd need some page
fault suppression mechanism to keep going. But branch misprediction a
la Spectre and similar can do the trick. See our recent BlindSide for
an example of such an attack against the kernel:
https://download.vusec.net/papers/blindside_ccs20.pdf.
