Untyped read and write functions seem very likely to be prone to problems.
Perhaps use a union to make sure each of the function patterns is named
and can be explicitly set?

Perhaps used explicit sizes rather than long which can vary
across different platforms.  Starting out with 64 bits
seems like a good idea for counters.

Various specific comments inline.

In general, moving to a non string based interface seems to eventually happen
to all subsystems ;)  Strings just don't lend themselves to flexible interfaces.

Basic approach looks reasonable to me.

Feels like you'd be better off just dropping the local enum entirely.
I guess it gives you a small amount of protection against undefined values,
but at cost of some otherwise pointless indirection.

Give you are centralising the handling of these, I'd be a bit surprised to ever
see this included from more than one file.  As such, I'd just put it in the
c files that uses it.

That's not pretty.  Try my union suggestion, then all of the functions
will be typed in the first place.

Skip having a local copy of a->owner as code will shorter and easier
to follow without.

As this stands any value of a->type not listed returns no error.
