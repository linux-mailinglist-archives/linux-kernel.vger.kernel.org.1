This is a bad way for reporting a bug
because your project is too big.

mbgclock/Makefile include the top Makefile,
which is more than 1000 lines.


Please provide steps to reproduce it
with a tiny test module.

You state 5.7.15 was fine.
So, could you also run git-bisect, please?

I cannot try it since that is not what
I install on my machine, sorry.


Please provide steps to reproduce it
for a person using a different environment.
