Subject: [PATCH 0/5] arm: dts: linksys: rename codename to model

Linksys chose to use codenames for a few of their devices and sell their
them under an entirely different name.

codename  model name
rango  -> wrt3200acm
mamba  -> wrt1900ac
cobra  -> wrt1900ac-v2
caiman -> wrt1200ac
shelby -> wrt1900acs

This introduces some extra loops in OpenWrt, a distribution specialized
on embedded Internet facing devices, as both codename and model name are
used within the build system. The double naming requires developers to
keep track of that mapping and introduces inconsistencies:

To build a specific device in OpenWrt profiles are used, named after the
device model, e.g. `wrt3200acm`. However as device tree is used and the
first item of the DT `compatible` list is `linksys,rango`, the running
device identifies itself as `linksys,rango`.

Such double naming complicates currently the automatic search for
firmware upgrade as the build system does not support such mapping.
Ideally the first item of the DT `compatible` list would contain a
string reasonable similar to the DT `model`.

With this patch set the Linksys device tree files are moved from
containing the codename to contain a sanitized model name and also use
it as first entry of the DT `compatible` list.
