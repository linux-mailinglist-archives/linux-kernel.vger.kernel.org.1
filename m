I'll defer to Stephen about phy stuff, but was kinda just expecting to
have different phy drivers for different process sizes, rather than
trying to bundle it all in one phy driver.  At least what I've seen
before for dsi/hdmi/etc phy's is that the register programming is
different enough to not really share much.
