Yes, it's unfortunate, but we have to stop making major concessions just
because tools are not up to the task.

We've done that way too much in the past and this particular problem
clearly demonstrates that there are limits.

Making brand new technology depend on sane tools is not asked too
much. And yes, it's inconvenient, but all of us have to build tools
every now and then to get our job done. It's not the end of the world.

Building clang is trivial enough and pointing the make to the right
compiler is not rocket science either.

Thanks,
