Thanks, since we don't have kernel-CI coverage for gpu, and there
probably isn't one person who has all the different devices supported
(or enough hours in the day to test them all), it is probably
better/safer to keep things in the backend code that is specific to a
given generation.

From the PoV of bringing up new a6xx, we should probably consider that
some of them may not *yet* have LLCC enabled.  I have an 8cx laptop
and once I find time to get the display working, the next step would
be bringing up a680.. and I'd probably like to start without LLCC..
