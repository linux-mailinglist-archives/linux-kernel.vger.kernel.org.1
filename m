Thank you for testing!

Commit 34ae204f1851 was not created to address performance.  Rather it was
created more for the sake of correctness.

IIRC, this test is going to stress the page fault path by continuing to produce
faults for the duration of the test.  Commit 34ae204f1851 removed an unneeded,
somewhat dangerous and redundant call to huge_pte_alloc in the fault path.
Your testing showed that removing this call helped address a good amount of the
performance regression.  The series proposed in this thread attempts to
eliminate more potentially unnecessary code in the hugetlb fault path.
Specifically, it will only acquire the i_mmap_rwsem when necessary.

Would you be willing to test this series on top of 34ae204f1851?  I will need
to rebase the series to take the changes made by 34ae204f1851 into account.

BTW - I believe that shared hugetlb mappings are the most common use case.
In the shared case, acquiring i_mmap_rwsem is necessary if pmd sharing is
possible.  There is little we can do to eliminate this.  The test suite does
not appear to test shared mappings.
