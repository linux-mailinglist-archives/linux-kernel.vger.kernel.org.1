Thanks for pursuing this. I have learned that the affected system is in
fact a production machine which doesn't seem to have any downtime window
planned soon. Moreover the issue is not always reproducible. So I cannot
guarantee I can have this or other patches tested soon which is really
unfortunate.

Right! I didn't bother to look at the wakeup callback so have missed
this. For completeness this behavior is there since 3510ca20ece01 which
we have in our 4.12 based kernel as well.
