Well for mlxsw, the user is used to this flow:
devlink dev flash - flash new fw
devlink dev reload - new fw is activated and reset and driver instances
are re-created.

I'm confused. So you think we need the driver default?

Well, that is what what is Moshe's proposal. Per-driver kernel default..
I'm not sure what we are arguing about then :/
