It's for the case that SLD is explicitly disabled by kernel params 
"split_lock_detect=off". You know, BIOS may turn SLD on for itself. So 
if user uses "split_lock_detect=off", we have to clear the SLD bit in 
case BIOS forgets to clear it.

I understand what you want. i.e., X86_FEATURE_SPLIT_LOCK_DETECT is 
independent from sld_off. I guess you have to make tglx accept it first.

Got it. you are running linux guest in your own VMM and there is warning 
in the VMM.

If you really want to avoid the MSR access on the platform without SLD. 
You could make the default sld_state as sld_unsupported. It can only be 
changed to other value in split_lock_setup() when SLD is enumerated. So 
in split_lock_init(), we can use if (sld_state == sld_unsupported) to 
skip the MSR_TEST_CTRL access.
