Subject: [The Times of Israel] Futuristic device from Israeli firm puts 
music in your head, without headphones

For Worldwide Release 19 November 2020 Thursday Singapore Time

We are not mentally ill at all. Governments have been using top secret 
advanced military grade technology for decades to make Targeted 
Individuals (TIs) hear voices and then label us crazy.

To all the millions of Targeted Individuals (TIs) all over the world, 
you ***MUST*** read the following news article published by The Times of 
Israel!

Title of News Article: Futuristic device from Israeli firm puts music in 
your head, without headphones

Synopsis: ‘Sound beaming’ 3-D technology from Noveto Systems tracks ear 
and sends it audio using ultrasonic waves, creating personal listening 
pockets

Journalist/Reporter: Louise Dixon

Publisher: The Times of Israel

Now millions of Targeted Individuals (TIs) all over the world will be 
able to cite this news article and 3D sound beaming technology as 
credible, solid and concrete evidence that governments have been making 
use of advanced technology to make Targeted Individuals (TIs) hear 
voices. Schizophrenia is NOT a mental illness but a condition induced by 
Government Mind Control Technology, which involves 3D sound beaming 
technology, Remote Neural Monitoring (RNM), satellites, wireless 
repeaters, cellular/mobile networks, brain-computer interface, 
nanotechnology brain implants/chips, bio-communications engineering, etc 
etc.

Mr. Turritopsis Dohrnii Teo En Ming, 42 years old as of 19 November 
2020, is a Targeted Individual (TI) living in Singapore. I, Turritopsis 
Dohrnii Teo En Ming, declare that schizophrenia (hearing voices) is NOT 
a mental illness.
