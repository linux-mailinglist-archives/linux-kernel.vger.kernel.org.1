Right - infrastructure problems aside (which are the easy part), tests
are quite flaky/noisy.

I guess we're getting quite off topic now, but in LKFT's case we run
tests that are available from the likes of LTP, kselftest, and a variety
of other test suites. Every test was written by a developer with certain
assumptions in place - many of which we violate when we run them on a
small arm board, for example. And many may just be low quality to begin
with, but they often work well enough for the original author's
use-case.

In such cases, we mark them (manually at this point) as a known issue.
For example, here are our kselftest known issues:
https://github.com/Linaro/qa-reports-known-issues/blob/master/kselftests-production.yaml

These lists are quite a chore to keep up to date, and so they tend to
lag reality. What's needed (and what we're working toward) is more
sophisticated analytics on top of our results to determine actual
regressions.

I'll give just one example, randomly selected but typical. Here's a
timer test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails, which compares how
much time something takes with a hard coded value of what the author
expects. Running on small arm hosts or under qemu, the following check
sometimes fails:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/tools/testing/selftests/timers/rtcpie.c#L104-L111

There are _many_ such tests - hundreds or thousands, which rely on hard
coded expectations and are quite hard to "fix". But we run them all
because most of them haven't failed yet, and if they do we'll find out
why.

We ignore the tests which either always fail, or which sometimes fail,
in general. I'm sure there are some legitimate bugs in that set of
failures, but they're probably not "regressions" so just as syzkaller
lets old bugs close automatically, we ignore tests that have a history
of failing.

From the link you gave, if you go up one level to
https://qa-reports.linaro.org/lkft/linux-mainline-oe/build/v5.7-rc1-24-g8632e9b5645b/testrun/1363280/,
you will see links to the "Log File" which takes you to
https://qa-reports.linaro.org/lkft/linux-mainline-oe/build/v5.7-rc1-24-g8632e9b5645b/testrun/1363280/log.

In some test suite cases (perhaps just LTP), we have logs per test. In
most, we just have one large log of the entire run. Even when we have a
log-per-test, it may miss some asynchronous dmesg output I expect,
causing an investigator to look at the whole log anyway.
