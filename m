I think you've got all that exactly right, thanks for working it out.
It originates from v3.7's 215c02bc33bb ("tmpfs: fix shmem_getpage_gfp()
VM_BUG_ON") - in which I also had to thank you.

I think I chose to do the delete_from_swap_cache() right there, partly
because of following shmem_unuse_inode() code which already did that,
partly on the basis that while we have to observe the case then it's
better to clean it up, and partly out of guilt that our page lock here
is what had prevented shmem_undo_range() from completing its job; but
I believe you're right that unused swapcache reclaim would sort it out
eventually.

Yes.

I haven't pulled down your V2 series into a tree yet (expecting perhaps
a respin from Alex on top, when I hope to switch over to trying them
both), so haven't looked into the context and may be wrong...

Two things on this.

Minor matter of taste, I'd prefer that as
			xas_set_err(&xas, entry ? -EEXIST : -ENOENT);
which would be more general and more understandable -
but what you have written should be fine for the actual callers.

Except... I think returning -ENOENT there will not work correctly,
in the case of a punched hole.  Because (unless you've reworked it
and I just haven't looked) shmem_getpage_gfp() knows to retry in
the case of -EEXIST, but -ENOENT will percolate up to shmem_fault()
and result in a SIGBUS, or a read/write error, when the hole should
just get refilled instead.

Not something that needs fixing in a hurry (it took trinity to
generate this racy case in the first place), I'll take another look
once I've pulled it into a tree (or collected next mmotm) - unless
you've already have changed it around by then.
