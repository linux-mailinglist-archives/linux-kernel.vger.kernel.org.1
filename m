It is there, please look again. Before any of the above happens,
memremap() will call try_ram_remap() for regions that are covered by a
IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM, and map it using __va() if its PFN is valid and
it is not highmem.

So as far as I can tell, this change has no effect on PPC at all
unless its RAM is not described as IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM.
