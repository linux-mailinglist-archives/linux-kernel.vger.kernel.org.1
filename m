We shouldn't be putting CPUs in the safe list when they have CSV2 reporting
that they are mitigated in hardware, so I don't think this is the right
approach.

Sounds more like KVM should advertise CSV2 for the vCPUs if all of the
physical CPUs without CSV2 set are on the safe list. But then again, KVM
has always been slightly in denial about big.LITTLE because you can't
sensibly expose it to a guest if there are detectable differences...
