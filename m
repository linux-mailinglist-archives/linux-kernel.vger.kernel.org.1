Is a re-implementation of the various MMU functions in this series
necessary to pre-populate the EPT/NPT? I realize the approach you took
is probably the fastest way to pre-populate an EPT, but it seems like
similar pre-population could be achieved with some changes to the PF
handler's prefault scheme or, from user space by adding a dummy vCPU
to touch memory before loading the actual guest image.

I think this series is taking a similar approach to the direct MMU RFC
I sent out a little less than a year ago. (I will send another version
of that series in the next month.) I'm not sure this level of
complexity is worth it if you're only interested in EPT pre-population.
Is pre-population your goal? You mention "parallel memory
virtualization," does that refer to parallel page fault handling you
intend to implement in a future series?

There are a number of features I see you've chosen to leave behind in
this series which might work for your use case, but I think they're
necessary. These include handling vCPUs with different roles (SMM, VMX
non root mode, etc.), MMU notifiers (which I realize matter less for
pinned memory), demand paging through UFFD, fast EPT
invalidation/teardown and others.
