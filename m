Thanks a lot for quick reply!
What I am confusing is the call chain: __iommu_dma_alloc_pages()
to split_huge_page(), in the func, splited page,
	page = alloc_pages_node(nid, alloc_flags, order);
And if the pages were added into lru, they maybe reclaimed and lost,
that would be a panic bug. But in fact, this never happened for long time.
Also I put a BUG() at the line, it's nevre triggered in ltp, and run_vmtests
in kselftest.

According to the explaination, looks like we could remove the code path,
since it's never got into. (base on my v15 patchset). Any comments?

Thanks
