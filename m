After validating width of framebuffer against pitch, the only thing we
need to check here is that the width matches. From what I can tell,
least for mxsfb, this should be covered by
drm_atomic_helper_check_plane_state's can_position parameter set to
false.

So I think in my case I can get away by only checking the framebuffer.
