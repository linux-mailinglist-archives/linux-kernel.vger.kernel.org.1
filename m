At least in the past I've seen that 'CONFIG_CMDLINE' interacts badly
with the bootloader provided command line in some architectures.  In
days of yore I tried to post a patch to fix this, at least on ARM
targets, but it never seemed to go anywhere upstream.  I'm going to
assume this is still a problem because I still see an ANDROID tagged
patch in the Chrome OS 5.4 tree:

In any case, as per my previous arguments, stuffing lots of config
into the cmdline is a bit clunky and doesn't scale well.  You end up
with a really long run on command line and it's hard to tell where one
config option ends and the next one starts and if the same concept is
there more than one time it's hard to tell and something might cancel
out a previous config option or maybe it won't and by the time you end
up finishing this it's hard to tell where you started.  :-)

Nothing prevents people from continuing to use the command line
options if they want, right?  This just allows a different default.
So if a distro is security focused and decided that it wanted a slower
/ more secure default then it could ship that way but individual users
could still override, right?
