So this is an ACPI-only driver that is instantiated by using the Device Tree
namespace link in ACPI. I am not sure how to deal with this, but I suspect we
need a proper OF binding definition before accept it.

The driver gets at least the baudrate and the flowcontrol from ACPI resources,
so I'm wondering if we should also add the properties in the device-tree
description (although we're not able to really test because there is not OF
hardware that supports it yet). Or is fine to just accept the compatible for now
and we can do this later when we have the possibility to test with OF-based
hardware.

Rob, any thoughts on this?

Thanks,
  Enric
