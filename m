Hi Martin,

Could this be just a panel getting confused because the pixel clock is
disabled, or is there really an issue with the IPU? Have you tried just
keeping clk_di_pixel enabled in ipu_di_disable(), but continuing
to disable DI and DC?

Just removing ipu_di_disable() leaks a clk_prepare_enable refcount on
the di->clk_di_pixel clock.

Also this is followed by an ipu_dc_disable(), which should remove the DC
module's clock if this is the only display. So the DC should be disabled
anyway.
