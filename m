This all looks good to me. Small notes below...

Here and the other per_clear comment have language that doesn't quite
line up with how hooks should deal with the bits. They should not "set
it to" the personality flags they want clear, they need to "add the
bits" they want to see cleared. i.e I don't want something thinking
they're the only one touching per_clear, so they should never do:
	bprm->per_clear = PER_CLEAR_ON_SETID;
but always:
	bprm->per_clear |= PER_CLEAR_ON_SETID;

How about:

The hook must set @bprm->per_clear with any personality flag bits that

Not about this patch, but while looking through this file, I see:

int cap_bprm_set_creds(struct linux_binprm *bprm)
{
	...
	*capability manipulations*

        if (WARN_ON(!cap_ambient_invariant_ok(new)))
                return -EPERM;

        if (nonroot_raised_pE(new, old, root_uid, has_fcap)) {
                ret = audit_log_bprm_fcaps(bprm, new, old);
                if (ret < 0)
                        return ret;
        }

        new->securebits &= ~issecure_mask(SECURE_KEEP_CAPS);

        if (WARN_ON(!cap_ambient_invariant_ok(new)))
                return -EPERM;
	...
}

The cap_ambient_invariant_ok() test is needlessly repeated: it doesn't
examine securebits, and nonroot_raised_pE appears to have no
side-effects.

One of those can be dropped, yes?
