Fair enough, I will just pass the allocated interrupt range base
instead of set_smp_cross_call() and use __ipi_send_mask() to invoke a
particular IPI.

And to request an arch specific IPI as NMI, will use
arch_get_ipinr_nmi() and in turn use request_percpu_nmi() to turn that
particular IPI as NMI.

Is there anything that I missed here?
