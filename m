Hi Vlastimil, 

Thanks for comments!

Oh, we did talk about the rcu_read_lock which is used to block memcg destroy during locking.
and the spin_lock actually includes a rcu_read_lock(). Yes, we could add this comments later.

The lru isolation still is same as old conception, a set actions that take a page from a lru list, and commit_charge do
need a isoltion for the page.

but the condition of page_memcg could be change since we don't rely on lru isolation for it. The comments
could be changed later.

TestClearPageLRU could block the page from memcg migration/destory.

Thanks
