Nope.  But 4.6.4 is a bug-fix release, 91 bugs fixed since 4.6.3, so you
should switch to it if you can :-)

Yes, I know.  And it is much preferred not to have stricter requirements
for Power, I know that too.  Something has to give though :-/

Yeah, just petered out I think?

All significant distros come with a 4.8 as system compiler.

Like that.  But you will have to do that to *all* places we use the "<>"
constraints, or wait for more stuff to fail?  And, there probably are
places we *do* want update form insns used (they do help in some loops,
for example)?
