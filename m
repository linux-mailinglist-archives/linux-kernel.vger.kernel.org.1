Thanks for the links, [1] definitely sounds interesting, I was under the 
impression
that changing such via sysfs is late, but seems like other Sai has got 
it working
for the default domain type. So we can extend that and add a strict 
attribute as well,
we should be definitely OK with system booting with default strict mode 
for all
peripherals as long as we have an option to change that later, Doug?

Thanks,
Sai
