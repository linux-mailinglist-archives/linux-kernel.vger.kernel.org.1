There is one exception. The entire descriptor is read also in
committed state. The content is considered valid when the stored
desc.info.caller_id matches @caller_id of the reader. It is
used when the descriptor gets reopened.

Well, it seems that only desc_out->caller_id value is used
in desc_reopen_last(). All the other values are accessed
directly when the descriptor is successfully reopened.

We should mention this exception in the comment at least.

This change looks unrelated. If I get it correctly, the value is
needed in desc_push_tail() to check whether the descriptor still
contains ID from the previous wrap. It fixes an older bug.
And it is a great catch!

We also should decide/comment whether it is needed to do the same
at the end of this function when re-checking the state returns
desc_miss.

It is not strictly needed because the value is used only to check
whether tail still points to the previous wrap. This would get caught
already during this first check. Any later desc_miss is not
interesting. We should mentions this in a comment.

Anyway, could we please move it into separate patch, so that the fix does
not get lost when this patch gets reverted from some reasons in the
future?

Just for record. The sequence number is valid even in the committed
state. It is not modified when the descriptor gets reopened.

Well, it is not a big deal. It is highly unlikely scenario. It would
mean that a descriptor from the previous wrap has not been finalized
even though it is committed and many new descriptors have been
reserved in the meantime (we are wrap ahead now).

It might happen only when the finalizing is delayed by NMI
and many messages appeared in the meantime.  It is the situation
when new space could not get reserved anyway.

I am fine with keeping it as is.

This restores the old code before 4th patch. It was probably not updated
when rebasing.

It should be:

	if ((head_lpos - next_lpos)  < DATA_SIZE(data_ring))

There is nothing to do when the positions are the same.

This comment does not longer fit the new representation of the state
bits. It should be something like:

"Attempt to transit the descriptor back from committed to reserved
state so that the record can be modified by a writer again.
This is only possible if the descriptor is not yet finalized."
