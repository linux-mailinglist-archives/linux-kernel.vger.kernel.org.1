Sounds like totally corrupted FAT image, and the directory may have the
non-simple loop (e.g. there is hardlink of directory).

If so, I'm not sure if we can detect without heavyweight check.  Well,
although user should run fsck before mount. However, if fs can detect
and stop early, it would be better.

BTW, if you run fsck, the corrupted directories and issue are gone at
least?

Anyway, fsck would be main way. And on other hand, if we want to add
mitigation for corruption, we would have to see much more details of
this corruption.  Can you put somewhere to access the corrupted image
(need the only metadata) to reproduce?

What happens if you recursively traversed directories on Windows? This
issue happens on Windows too?

Thanks.
