We perform stress testing on machines in the test environment, and use scripts
to capture journal related logs to analyze problems. There are 12 disks on this
machine, and each disk runs different jobs. Our test kernel also adds some
additional function-related logs. If we adjust the log level to a higher level,
a large number of logs have nothing to do with the disk to be observed. These
logs are generated by system agents or coordinated tasks. This makes the log
difficul to analyze.

Our test kernel did this. Because it broke the log format, I was not sure whether
it would break something, so I didn't bring this part. Even if the device information
is added, when there are more disks and the log level is higher, there will be a
lot of irrelevant logs, which makes it necessary to consume a lot of CPU to filter
messages. Therefore, a device-level switch is provided to make everything simpler.
