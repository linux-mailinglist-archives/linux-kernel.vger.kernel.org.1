OK, but those stats are guarded by 'if (mapping)', so this patch doesn't
produce that warning because we'll have taken the xarray lock and disabled
interrupts.

Yes.  We want to avoid doing:

	if (mapping)
		spin_lock(&ds_queue->split_queue_lock);
	else
		spin_lock_irq(&ds_queue->split_queue_lock);
...
	if (mapping)
		spin_unlock(&ds_queue->split_queue_lock);
	else
		spin_unlock_irq(&ds_queue->split_queue_lock);

Just using _irqsave has the same effect and is easier to reason about.

I imagine Hugh's objection was that we know it's safe to disable/enable
interrupts here because we're in a sleepable context.  But for the
other two locks, we'd rather not track whether we've already disabled
interrupts or not.

Maybe you could dig up the email from Hugh?  I can't find it.
