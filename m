Blacklist most definitely has a negative connotation in technical use.
You blacklist devices that don't work properly, you blacklist drivers
that don't work for your hardware, you blacklist domains that are
sending spam or trying to mount network attacks on your servers. Things
on the blacklist are "bad" in one way or the other, that's the reason
they're on it.
