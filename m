Right, the dma_declare_coherent_memory() usage was introduced only in
v5.1 as part of vdev subdevice creation. Prior to that, the allocations
used the rproc dev DMA pool which would have been initialized in the
platform drivers.

ST drivers are already using the "vdev0buffer" on latest kernels, so
they will not be entering the fallback path anyway right. Looking at
4.19 kernel, I see that you guys were also using a single
reserved-memory region (didn't have DT nodes though), so all allocations
would have come from that region. The patch is for fixing the
allocations for drivers that were defining a DMA rproc pool, and still
using them (so not having to force the drivers to add code to fix the
issue).

Yeah, if we used the hard-coded 0 and you were adapting to use a default
pool. Otherwise, you could technically update or define the new generic
name (which has to be added to remoteproc core as well).

This could definitely be an enhancement and conversion of existing
drivers, but at this point, the idea is to restore the allocations to
how they were for drivers defining a DMA pool and without having to
modify them.

So, if we were to get rid of the dma_declare_coherent_memory() usage
from remoteproc core, then I actually don't see need for the other args
in rproc_of_resm_mem_entry_init(), just the name and id. And even that
you would only need if you are going to have to deal with multiple
devices to assign the DMA pool for, for which you would need the name.
