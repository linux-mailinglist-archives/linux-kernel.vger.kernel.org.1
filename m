Subject: [PATCH 18/38] vc: extract detecting control characters from do_con_write

Move the control characters detection to a separate function dubbed
vc_is_control. It makes the 14 subexpressions a "bit" more readable. And
also simplifies next patches.

It moves also CTRL_ACTION and CTRL_ALWAYS to this new function, as they
are used exclusively here. While at it, these are converted to static
const variables.

And we use "& BIT()" instead of ">>" and "& 1".

Checked using symbolic execution (klee), that the old and new
behaviors are the same.
