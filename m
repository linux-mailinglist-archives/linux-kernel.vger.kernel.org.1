Interesting use-case! It seems like you're in the position of needing to
invert the assumption about syscalls: before you knew everything going
through WinAPI needed emulation, and now you need to assume everything
not going through a native library needs emulation. Oof.

Is it possible to disassemble and instrument the Windows code to insert
breakpoints (or emulation calls) at all the Windows syscall points?

Just so I can understand the expected use: given the dynamic nature of
the library loading, how would Wine be marking the VMAs?

Was the BPF JIT enabled? I was recently examining filter performance too:

It looks like you're using SECCOMP_RET_TRAP for this? Signal handling
can be pretty slow. Did you try SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF?

Maybe? I want to spend a little time exploring alternatives first. :)

I don't know this area very well. Hopefully some of the mm folks can
comment on it. It seems like there needs to be a more dynamic way mark
VMAs for arbitrary purposes (since this isn't _actually_ a PROT* flag,
it's just a marking for seccomp to check).

Regardless, here's a review of the specifics of patch, without regard to
the design question above. :)

Since I don't see anything distinct in the requirements for
SECCOMP_MEMMAP, so I don't think it needs a separate CONFIG: it is almost
entirely built on the SECCOMP_FILTER infrastructure. I'd just drop the
CONFIGs.

I have no idea what the correct way to mark VMAs would be. As you
mentioned, this seems ... wrong. :)

AIUI, all of the above is to plumb the VMA marking through an mprotect()
call. I wonder if perhaps madvise() would be better? I'm not sure how
tight we are on new flags there, but I think it would be cleaner to use
that interface. Take a look at MADV_WIPEONFORK / VM_WIPEONFORK.

Making this incompatible with FILTER might cause problems for the future
(more and more process launchers are starting to set filters).

So this would, perhaps, be a new flag for struct seccomp, rather than a
new operating mode.

No new kernel code should use BUG:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

I would maybe pr_warn_once(), but then treat it as if it was marked with
VM_NOSYSCALL.

This really just looks like an ip_address filter, but I get what you
mean about stacking filters, etc. This may finally be the day we turn to
eBPF in seccomp, since that would give you access to using a map lookup
on ip_address, and the map could be updated externally (removing the
need for the madvise() changes).

This should just test for any bits in flags. TSYNC + memmap should be
avoided, IMO.

The prctl() interface is deprecated, so no new features should be added
there.

So, yes, interesting. I'll continue to think about how this could work
best. Can you share what your filters looked like when you were
originally trying those?

Thanks!
