Yes indeed, the dev_warn traces after of_reserved_mem_device_init().

So, no additional parsing other than to know which id if you have
multiple regions. A device can only be assigned one default DMA/CMA pool
to use with the DMA API. One would need to add the assignment statement
only if region 0 is not being used as the device DMA-API pool.

That is actually lot more code than the current code. First you would
need to lookup and parse the reserved mem to get the address and size to
initialize the rproc mem structure, and then use the filled in values to
declare the DMA pool.

Yep, I started out indeed with exactly that code in v1, and only
introduced the new field to address Arnaud's comments. Even the new
field is intrinsically initialized to 0, so the code is equivalent, and
supports the cases in case you need to use a different reserved-memory
region than at index 0.
