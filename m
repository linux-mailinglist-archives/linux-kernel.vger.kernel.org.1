Withough reading everything through at least.

* There is also security_setprocattr which needs ptrace and nnp state not to
  change it needs to set something that at least selinux's cred
  calculations needs to remain constant (like nnp and ptrace).

  Which means one thread calling security_setprocattr and another thread
  calling exec can deadlock in de_thread.

* Even with your lock and just the ptrace case I can deadlock.
  Ptracer:                  Thread A               Tread B
     ptrace_attach A
                                                   exec
     ptrace_attach B
                                                   uprade R to RW
     ---------------------- DEADLOCKED -------------------------

Those are the first two cases I have thought of.  There are probably
more.



But fundamentally the only reason we need this information stable
before the point of no return is so that we can return a nice error
code to the process calling exec.  Instead of terminating the
process with SIGSEGV.

These are for the most part unlikely scenarios or people would have been
complaining much more loudly about deadlock.

So my plan is to perform the relevant calculations effectively twice.
Once just before the point of no return, and give a graceful return code
if necessary and possible.  Once just afer the point of no return, and
SIGSEGV if necessary.



Of course this all only applies to LSMs that refuse to continue under
NNP or ptrace without changing the cred.  Linux without those LSMs
enabled will just continue with the original credentials.


So I don't think we will noticably be sacraficing the quality of
the user experience with my plan.  In the worst case a deadlock
will become a SIGSEGV killing the execing program.

Eric

p.s. Yes we can do better than a mutex that makes everything mutually
     exclusive. I am just starting there for simplicity, and to
     see if we need anything better.  Unfortuantely too many things are
     changing simultaneously for rcu to cover all of the read side
     cases.
