I'd still say it was a bad idea to accept just about anything like
"yoghurt" or "0x01" as valid input. And having some attributes accept
"0x01" or "01" as true while other consider it false as is the case
today is less than ideal.

For sysfs we should be able to pick and enforce a representation, or
three, for example, by adding a 1-character length check for the above
examples (which have since been extended to accept "Often" and
"ontology" and what not).

A quick grep shows we have about 55 attributes using [k]strtobool and 35
or so which expects integers and reject malformed input like "1what". So
perhaps not too late to fix. ;)

But ok, I'll use kstrtobool().
