Hello, With Due Respect,

My name is Mrs Marie Smith, I am an Canadian, was married to Late Dr. IDRISU Smith , We were married for 32 years without a child. My late husband was a businessman and Gold merchant but he was poisoned by his business partners. And Recently, My Doctor told me that I will undergo a Surgery (Cancer ) and I may not survive it or live longer than required due to my health condition. I inherited a total sum funds from my late husband, which is deposited in a bank . Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to any God fearing man or woman who will use the money the way I am going to instruct. I want somebody who will fulfill the desire of I and my late husband to help the less privileged people, orphanages and the widows in our society. I took this decision because according to my history, I was once an orphan who was raised from orphanage home in Canada .

This is why I am taking this decision to hand over this fund to you in good faith and measure to help the less privileged by opening a foundation you will call "MARIE FOUNDATION". If you are interested in to handle this project, please give me your, name, address, profession and telephone numbers for me to get the inheritance letter for you as soon as possible. I have a limited time to live, I am not afraid of death, hence I know where I am going. I want you to always remember me in your daily prayers because of my upcoming Cancer Surgery. Kindly contact me if you are interested to carry out this humanitarian 
duty. 

Please give me your below details

Your Full name
Your Address
Occupation
Phone No
