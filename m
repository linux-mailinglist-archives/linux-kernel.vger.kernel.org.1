Reclaim can certainly fail. It is however surprising to see it fail with
such a large inactive lru list and reasonably small reclaim target.
Having the full LRU of dirty pages sounds a bit unusual, IO throttling
for v2 and explicit throttling during the reclaim for v1 should prevent
from that. If the reclaim gives up too easily then this should be
addressed at the reclaim level.

Please elaborate some more. memcg_nr_pages_over_high shouldn't really
depend on the system wide activity. It should scale with the requested
charges. So yes it can get large for something like a large read/write
which does a lot of allocations in a single syscall before returning to
the userspace.
 
But ok, let's say that the reclaim target is large and then a single
reclaim attempt might fail. Then I am wondering why your patch is not
really targetting to reclaim memcg_nr_pages_over_high pages and instead
push for reclaim down to the high limit.

The main problem I see with that approach is that the loop could easily
lead to reclaim unfairness when a heavy producer which doesn't leave the
kernel (e.g. a large read/write call) can keep a different task doing
all the reclaim work. The loop is effectivelly unbound when there is a
reclaim progress and so the return to the userspace is by no means
proportional to the requested memory/charge.
