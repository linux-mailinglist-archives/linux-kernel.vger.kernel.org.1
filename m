It doesn't help with knowing IF all the consumers will instantiate,
but it does help put an upper bound on when it's okay to release the
"boot on" regulators/resources.

Instead of "userspace might load a module at any time and then bring
up new consumers so we can never tell when it's okay and hence we
can't do anything" to "we know all the consumers, so we just need to
wait for them to probe". And this helps a lot for systems where
enabled devices aren't going to be left uninstantiated forever.

Right, but knowing the hardware descriptions allows us to put an upper
bound on how long we'll have to wait. And for cases where we don't
want to listen to hardware description for whatever reason, we can
have the timeout option to be backwards compatible.

Yeah, I wasn't trying to suggest that. We can reword it later.

Right.

Which is a problem even today when multiple consumers are using one
regulator. I do plan to address that in later patches.

The idea is to keep the settings at a minimum of what the boot loader
left the "boot on" regulators at. For voltage, we can just do this for
regulators that support "get_voltage" and it's fairly trivial to do
with sync_supply. For "load" there is no "get_load" because it kinda
doesn't make sense (most regulator can't measure the load?), but maybe
we can add something like get_max_load() (current max load it can
support) and then set that as the minimum load the regulator needs to
support.

Yeah, sorry, I meant to add a "RFC" prefix. It's not close to being
merge ready. For one, I didn't add much documentation at all.

It's kinda similar to "supply", it's a regulator client handle. But
it's a regulator client handle to the same regulator. It's used to put
the "minimum" requirements on the regulator.

Wherever it's used as a flag, it's just to say "if you already voted
for the minimum, don't vote again" or "if you didn't vote for a
minimum, there's nothing to remove now".

Well, for a device that registers with multiple frameworks, they might
implement their own sync_state() that then calls into the helpers
provided by multiple frameworks. Or they might want to do additional
clean up over what regulator_sync_state() does, etc. So it makes sense
for the callback to go to the driver and it's not just a flag. But in
the context of this patch, I get what you are saying and I agree.

Both of those threads are from a long time back. And one of them was
from me :) Things have changed a lot since then -- device links,
sync_state(), fw_devlinks, wanting this to work for modules, etc. And
what they are proposing is very different from what I'm suggesting
here. And some of the older arguments against this aren't valid
either. I'm happy to shoot them down if they are brought up here.

Saw your subsequent reply :) Google is sending this because this is
not an issue just one vendor is seeing. I'll try to see if I can get
any of them to engage upstream, but can't promise that.

> You haven't mentioned an actual use case here (your changelog just

Ah, I thought I mentioned it in the "not part of commit text" section,
but I guess I didn't. In the hardware I'm testing, display is one
example of something that doesn't work without this. But it's hardware
that's on an old kernel and has a bunch of downstream stuff. I'm sure
I can dig up and find upstream cases, just haven't gotten around to
that. But this has been a recurring issue for vendors that's
definitely a real one.

There's no way to order/guarantee device probe ordering. The closest
we can get to that is initcall ordering or module load ordering. But
that has a couple of problems:
- Can't handle cases where the same driver probes two different
devices with different ordering requirements.
- Falls apart when a driver defers probe of a device.
- Doesn't work with async probing

Initcall can only order driver registration, which isn't really very
useful for what we need here.

Agree, which is why fw_devlink solves "How do I know all my
consumers?" and sync_state solve "are all my consumers probed?" at the
system level and not bogging down each framework with that. The
framework still has to do the actual steps. Which is what I'm trying
to implement here.

Anyway, I'll rework my patch to do the timeout and/or do this for all
drivers and we'll take it from there?
