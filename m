There appear to be quite a few in-tree MFD drivers that register IRQ
controllers, like this driver does:

$ grep --exclude-dir=.git -rnE "irq_domain_(add|create).+\(" drivers/mfd | wc -l
23

As a further example, drivers/mfd/stpmic1.c closely resembles this
driver in that it uses both devm_regmap_add_irq_chip() as well as
devm_of_platform_populate().

As such, it seems like this driver is in line with some of the
architectural choices that have been accepted in already-merged drivers.
Could you please elaborate on your concerns?

Will change to MFD_QCOM_I2C_PMIC.

Will expand this to "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. I2C PMIC support".

It is internal company policy to update the copyright year only for
those years when a change was made to the driver. Since this driver hasn't
been modified since 2018, the copyright year has also been static since
then. Otherwise, the driver is very much current functionality-wise.

What modification would you suggest for the copyright year?

Sure. Would this be acceptable instead, with the custom string replaced by a
macro that the kernel provides?

	#define pr_fmt(fmt) "%s: %s: " fmt, KBUILD_MODNAME, __func__

(Please see my first comment above.)

Thank you.
