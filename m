Agreed, I have sent patches for all the zero-length arrays. Some
of them still need more discussion or better ideas when they are not
trivially changed to flexible arrays, but there are not actually so many
of them that cause warnings right now.

I think in this case it's not the warning that is new, but (same as
the free free() case) the compiler now knows that snprintf() comes with
a restrict pointer in standard C even when we don't mention it in our
declaration.

I think I had sent the same patches and they got merged into linux-next,
but the maintainers did not consider them to be v5.7 material as
this was all old code.

Thanks for looping me in. I will try to investigate what is going on,
as I did not see a huge increase in these warnings after I moved
to gcc-10, and clearly something is going very wrong. Some more
notes on the topic:

- I absolutely agree that on a release kernel, doing 'make -s
  allmodconfig; make -skj30' should produce zero output,
  and anything else is a problem that needs to be addressed
  in some form, so turning them off for the moment is sensible.

- I also think that the warning about possibly uninitialized variables
  is an important tool in general, as long as it works well enough,
  as Rusty explained many years ago in
  https://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=232
  It is super-annoying to see false-positivies pop up in old code, but
  when writing new code, that warning has saved me from running
  some stupidly broken code many times.

- Jason Donenfeld noticed that the gcc-10 inliner is much less
  aggressive in -O2 and suggested using -O3 by default to get
  the original behavior back.
  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200507224530.2993316-1-Jason@zx2c4.com/
  I'm not sure we want all the things that -O3 does, but whatever
  changed in the inliner is probably the root cause for the new
  warnings, and for the same reason we previously turned off the
  warning in "-Os".

- There is a big difference between the handling of this warning
  between gcc and clang: while both have false positives and
  false negatives (see: halting problem), the behavior of clang is
  more reliable as the set of warnings it produces does not
  depend on inlining decisions.

- There is a good chance that some trivial difference between
  mainline and linux-next, or between linux-next and my test
  branch (with a couple hundred fixup patches) is causing you
  to see many warnings that I don't get. I'll try to reproduce and
  bisect what I find.

      Arnd
