True.  But at least the dependency restricts the confusion to a smaller
audience.

Oh, you also want to build a "generic" guest kernel, with all ARCH_*
symbols disabled. Let's hope a maleficent user cannot disable errata
mitigations in the guest kernel and break the host ;-)
And perhaps you do want to enable some platform-specific drivers for
VFIO pass-through?  Hence having ARCH_* dependencies on those drivers
means they cannot be enabled :-( Hmm...

OK, makes sense.
