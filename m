Agreed.

I think we could extend this design by receiving list of exceptional domains.
For example, if 'feature_persistent' is True and exceptions list has '123,
456', domains of domid 123 and 456 will not use persistent grants, and vice
versa.

I could implement this, but... to be honest, I don't really understand the
needs of the fine-grained control.  AFAIU, the problem is 'scalability' vs
'data copy overhead'.  So, only small systems would want to turn persistent
grants off.  In such a small system, why would we need fine-grained control?
I'm worrying if I would implement and maintain a feature without real use case.

For the reason, I'd like to suggest to keep this as is for now and expand it
with the 'exceptions list' idea or something better, if a real use case comes
out later.
