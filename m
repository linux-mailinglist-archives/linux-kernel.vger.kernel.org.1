The boot flow is determined by defconfig during compilation, which means 
each boot flow will have its own defconfig.

SDM firmware loads SPL into OCRAM, then SPL will load the apporiate ATF 
or U-boot into the DRAM according to the setting of CONFIG_SPL_ATF. If 
CONFIG_SPL_ATF=y, SPL loads ATF and then jumps to ATF. ATF setups EL3 
environment and initialize the PSCI services.

CONFIG_SPL_ATF is not set for the old boot flow.
