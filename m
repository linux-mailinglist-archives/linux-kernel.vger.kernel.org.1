Hi Alex,

Thanks a lot for comments! 

In this func's call path __page_cache_release, the page is unlikely be
ClearPageLRU, since this page isn't used by anyone, and going to be freed.
just __ClearPageLRU would be safe, and could save a non lru page flags disturb.

before the ClearPageLRU, there is a put_page_testzero(), that means no one using
this page, and isolate_lru_page can not run on this page the in func checking. 
	VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(!page_count(page), page);
So it would be safe here.

Right.

As to this change, It has to do in this patch, since any TestClearPageLRU may
cause lru bit miss in the lru list, so the precondication check has to
removed here.
