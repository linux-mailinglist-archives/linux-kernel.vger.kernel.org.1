Reverting commit 716a7a25969003d8 ("driver core: fw_devlink: Add support
for batching fwnode parsing") requires reverting commits
fefcfc968723caf9 ("driver core: Remove check in
driver_deferred_probe_force_trigger()") and 93d2e4322aa74c1a ("of:
platform: Batch fwnode parsing when adding all top level devices"),
too.

While reverting the latter is sufficient to fix the regression for me, I
can confirm that reverting all three fixes the issue, too.
