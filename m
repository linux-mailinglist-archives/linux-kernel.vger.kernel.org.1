This can work, but only if the call from the idle loop is a place where
either RCU isn't watching on the one hand or that cannot be in an RCU
read-side critical section on the other.  Because rcu_exp_handler()
assumes that if this function returns true, we are not in an RCU read-side
critical section.  (I would expect this to be the case, but I figured
that I should make it explicit.)

Could we please have a comment noting the change in semantics and
the reason?

Wouldn't it also be a good idea to check that we are in the context of
an idle thread?  Just in case some idiot like me drops a call to this
function in the wrong place, for example, if I were to mistakenly remember
the old semantics where it would return false from process context?

Maybe something like this?

	nesting = __this_cpu_read(rcu_data.dynticks_nmi_nesting;
	if (nesting > 1)
		return false;
	WARN_ON_ONCE(!nesting && !is_idle_task(current));

>  		return false;

And let's check the other callers:

rcu_sched_clock_irq():  This will always be called from IRQ (right?), so
	no problem.

rcu_pending():  Only called from rcu_sched_clock_irq(), so still no problem.

rcu_flavor_sched_clock_irq(): Ditto for both definitions.
