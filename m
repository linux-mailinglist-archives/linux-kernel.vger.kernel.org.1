That's actually doable in KVM, e.g. a hack could be done in <10 lines of
code.  A proper fix that integrates with KVM's emulator would be
substantially more code and effort though.

Eh, 63 VM-Exits is peanuts in the grand scheme.  Even with the host-side
gup() that's probably less than 50us.

This is where I'm unclear as to the guest behavior.  Is it doing *just*
CLFLUSH, or is it doing CLFLUSH followed by other accesses to the poisoned
page?  If it's the former, then it's probably worth at least exploring a
KVM fix.  If it's the latter, then yeah, emulating CLFLUSH for a poisoned
#MC is pointless.  I assume it's the latter since the goal is to recover
data?

Oh, and FWIW, the guest won't actually get UC for that page.
