For this you need an if/then schema. There are plenty of examples in
the tree, but this is what you need:

if:
  properties:
    compatible:
      enum:
        - idt,5p49v5933
        - idt,5p49v5935
then:
  properties:
    clocks:
      maxItems: 1
    clock-names:
      const: xin

>  * for the other parts one of these:
>    - only 'xin'

>

For the 2nd part:

clock-names:
  minItems: 1
  maxItems: 2
  items:
    enum: [ xin, clkin ]

bindings/example-schema.yaml is intended to do that. No doubt it could
use more examples. Though from my perspective people already don't
read and follow things it says there.

The problem I think is not the typical cases, but the atypical ones. I
don't think we can enumerate all the atypical cases. At that point you
really need some understanding of json-schema which I agree has a bit
of a learning curve if you've never used anything like it (I hadn't).
