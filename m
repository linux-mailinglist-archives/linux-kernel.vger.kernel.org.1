Also the RFC states :

"This password never appears in the connection stream, and the actual
    form of the password is up to the application. It could even change
    during the lifetime of a particular connection so long as this change
    was synchronized on both ends"

It means the key can be changed, but this does not imply the option
can be turned on/off dynamically.
