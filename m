The piece added here (using ZONE_DEVICE) will be relevant when Xen can
provide the space to map foreign pages, it's just that right now it
relies on iomem_resource instead of a Xen specific resource map that
should be provided by the hypervisor. It should indeed be fixed, but
right now this patch should allow a PVH dom0 to work slightly better.
When Xen provides such areas Linux just needs to populate a custom Xen
resource with them and use it instead of iomem_resurce.

The Arm stuff I'm certainly not familiar with, and can't provide much
insight on that. If it's best to just disable it and continue to rely
on ballooned out pages that's fine.

Roger.
