Sorry for the delay, I completed this morning the review of your patches and I
do not have anymore comments on them. Thank you for making the effort and
bringing the time namespace support to arm64.

I have though a question on something I encountered during the testing of the
patches: I noticed that all the tests related to CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM fail on
arm64 (please find the results below the scissors). Is this expected?
