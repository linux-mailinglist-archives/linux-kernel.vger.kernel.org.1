Trying to go through the discussions last year, hopefully things get
clearer.

So prior to the ZONE_DMA change, you still couldn't reserve 1G in the
first 4GB? It shouldn't be sparsely populated during early boot.

The problem I see is that with your patches we diverge from x86
behaviour (and the arm64 behaviour prior to the ZONE_DMA reduction) as
we now require that crashkernel=X,low is always passed if you want
something in ZONE_DMA (and you do want, otherwise the crashdump kernel
fails to boot).

My main requirement is that crashkernel=X, without any suffix, still
works which I don't think is guaranteed with your patches (well,
ignoring RPi4 ZONE_DMA). Bhupesh's series is a quick fix but doesn't
solve your large allocation requirements (that may have worked prior to
the ZONE_DMA change).

You don't even need to have a RPi4 machine, ZONE_DMA has been set to 1GB
unconditionally. And while we could move it back to 4GB on non-RPi4
hardware, I'd rather have a solution that fixes kdump for RPi4 as well.

So you mean rebasing your series on top of Bhupesh's? I guess you can
combine the two, I really don't care which way as long as we fix both
issues and agree on the crashkernel= semantics. I think with some tweaks
we can go with your series alone.

IIUC from the x86 code (especially the part you #ifdef'ed out for
arm64), if ",low" is not passed (so just standard crashkernel=X), it
still allocates sufficient low memory for the swiotlb in ZONE_DMA. The
rest can go in a high region. Why can't we do something similar on
arm64? Of course, you can keep the ",low" argument for explicit
allocation but I don't want to mandate it.

So with an implicit ZONE_DMA allocation similar to the x86 one, we
probably don't need Bhupesh's series at all. In addition, we can limit
crashkernel= to the first 4G with a fall-back to high like x86 (not sure
if memblock_find_in_range() is guaranteed to search in ascending order).
I don't think we need an explicit ",high" annotation.

So with the above, just a crashkernel=1G gives you at least 256MB in
ZONE_DMA followed by the rest anywhere, with a preference for
ZONE_DMA32. This way we can also keep the reserve_crashkernel_low()
mostly intact from x86 (less #ifdef's).

Do I miss anything?
