OK, after having looked at this more, I think my initial analysis is
actually wrong and this code should work as-is.

The thing that I missed yesterday is that we only add the request to the
blk_cpu_done list in the IPI, this means that the race I described
earlier is not in fact possible.

The IPI must happen for progress to be made.

And the same is true for blk_mq_force_complete_rq(), which also uses
this csd.

To still answer your question; irq_work_queue*() has an atomic op extra
that allows for more convenient semantics -- but is in your case
strictly superfluous.

Still, Jens' point about irq_work being smaller stands, and I think more
users could benefit from something intermediate. Let me continue with
the cleanups / audit and see what comes out at the end.

Thanks!
