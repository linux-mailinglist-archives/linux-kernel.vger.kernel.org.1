It *might* be easier if you jump to the bottom and read the reasoning

I'm sorry it comes across that way. That's certainly not my intention.
Hopefully, we can walk through this together and I'll make more sense.

Eh... I would disagree. The similarity stops at "both solutions use a
regulator consumer to set the limits". The implementation you see
there is based on QC specific DT entries, is based on late_initcall to
"ensure" all consumers have probed, doesn't work for modules, etc.

Ok, at the end of the email, I'll start from a high level and then dig
into more details at each step. Hopefully that'll clarify the reasoning.

You keep raising the point "why not just add another initcall level"
to solve the problem of "sync the suppliers after all the consumers
are ready". Or you say that my patch series is just a roundabout way
of adding another initcall level. I'm explaining why adding just
another initcall level won't work.

Again, definitely misunderstanding my point. I'm saying exactly the
opposite. We need to take deferred probe into account and deferred
probe completely invalidates any attempts to guarantee ordering based
on initcall levels. I even mentioned this in point 5 in my earlier
email.

And how is this going to work in systems where some devices don't have
drivers? Even with one missing driver, none of the devices/drivers are
going to get this initcall that you suggest. So it makes the
granularity issue worse.

No, with sync_state(), only suppliers to devices without drivers
wouldn't get the callback. Rest of the suppliers will get the callback
and can sync their state.

Even if you do per-regulator tracking, you can have one regulator
shared by many consumers and you'll still hit this issue. So, going to
a regulator level tracking doesn't solve this.

The correctness issue I care about is not power consumption. It's
about not pulling the plug on or under volting an active device before
the driver can take control of it.

This paragraph seems to be self contradictory to me. I don't
understand how you can claim the drivers handle it gracefully without
exclusive_get(), but then still say they can't handle a regulator
being on when they request for it to be off. They just need to handle
it gracefully for the first 30s of boot with my patch series. Only
when regulator_cleanup_timeout=-1 is set is there a potential for the
regulator to be kept on forever.

Ok, I'll try to explain the reasoning from the top.

Firstly, the problem being solved is not specific to regulators. It's
a general issue that needs to be solved for many frameworks/suppliers.
We want a mechanism for a supplier driver to know when all the
consumers are up and managing their resources so that the supplier
driver can do a clean handoff from bootloader to the kernel.

However, we don't want each framework doing very similar but slightly
different things. That creates inconsistencies across frameworks, code
repetition, maintenance headache, etc. In addition to that, it's also
very inefficient for every framework to be trying to figure out the
dependencies from firmware and tracking them separately.

Even if you just try to answer "are all the consumers ready?" at a
resource level (eg: at a regulator level), can't depend on get()/put()
APIs provided by frameworks. Some of the reasons:
1. A consumer might do "get()" and then end up deferring further down
the probe function. If that get() was the last get() you needed to
decide "all consumers are ready", and you remove the boot limits, then
the system could crash because the last consumer isn't actually ready.
2. Not all consumers do the "get()" in their probe functions. They
might do it later for multiple reasons.
3. Not all properties in the firmware are actually used/supported by
the driver. So, you can't assume all consumers referring to the
resource will actually call get() on it.

So, even if you track at a resource level, you need to check for the
consumer readiness by looking at the device bound state. fw_devlink
adds all the supplier-consumer dependencies by creating device links
(currently only DT is supported). So, tracking consumer device
readiness is easier.

So, say you have a callback that you get for every single consumer
binding successfully. What can you do there? For every consumer, you
have to parse their firmware (Eg: DT node) to see what all resources
they use (Eg: all the -supply properties) and increment the "consumer
ref count" for those resources (Eg: regulators). And this needs to be
done by every framework that manages suppliers.

Ok, now you have a "number of consumers ready" refcount per resource.
But to know if all the consumers of a resource are ready, you'll also
need the total number of consumers per resource. How do you find that
out?

Whatever scheme you use to count the total number of consumers, you
need to make sure you also take into account consumer devices that
have not been added yet. As in device_add() hasn't been done. For
example, child devices in DT that haven't been added yet because their
parent hasn't probed.

fw_devlink again helps avoid parsing the entire DT. It creates "proxy"
device links between a supplier device and the parent device of a
consumer if the consumer hasn't been added yet.

So, when the "a consumer has probed" callback comes, apart from what
you have to do already (tracking "number of consumers ready" at a
resource level), you also need to parse all the descendant nodes (not
just direct children) of that consumer's firmware node to check and
potentially increment the "total consumers" at a per resource (Eg:
regulator) level. Again, this will need to be done for every
framework.

And we still haven't dealt with the case where a consumer binds and
unbinds. Say a resource (Eg: regulator) has N consumers. Say, only M
(< N) consumers are ready/bound so far. Then one of the M consumers
unbinds and then binds again. So, your "consumers ready" refcount per
resource becomes M + 1 when only M consumers are ready. So, at a per
resource level you have to now also track "already seen" devices or
track device unbinding. And those "devices" themselves might vanish
and come back again (Eg: DT overlays, the dwc driver that adds/removes
child devices during probe, etc). I'm not even going to try and expand
on how each framework would handle this  -- it becomes very messy.

Also, even if we do resource level tracking, it doesn't solve the
problem of a consumer that expects regulator_disable() to turn off the
regulator even when it's not using get_exclusive(). For example, the
same regulator can have more than one consumer but the consumer that
needs exclusive behavior just happens to probe first and has full
control of the regulator. With boot limits applied at a regulator
level, it'll still prevent the regulator from being turned off.

So, long story short, tracking at a resource level:
1. Will be way more complicated than tracking at a consumer device level.
2. Will use a lot more memory.
3. Will use be a lot less efficient due to all the repeated parsing
and tracking you'll have to do.
4. Doesn't really solve the "need exclusive but doesn't use
get_exclusive()" consumer problem.

But then why not just do a "boot done" initcall/callback instead of
doing it based on supplier-consumers device level dependencies?

"boot done" can be done in a couple of ways:
1. Have userspace tell that it's done loading all the modules. This is
pretty much a no go as the kernel now depends on userspace for proper
functionality.
2. Timer, but this is a configuration nightmare and doesn't work reliably.
3. Wait till every single device has been bound to a driver. The
problem with this is that even if a single device is not bound to a
driver, the entire system would be stuck in a "boot not done yet"
mode. So any device left on by the boot loader would be permanently
stuck on and can't go to states that are incompatible with their state
at boot.

So this is basically a cost (complexity) vs benefit (system vs device
vs resource level removing of boot limits) problem.

Device level granularity provides the best bang for the buck.
Hopefully that clarifies the reasoning.

Would you consider this series if the boot limit is only set when
regulator_cleanup_timeout=-1 (as opposed to always)? Then the default
behavior will stay identical to before this series and only when
regulator_cleanup_timeout=-1 will any of this code kick in.
