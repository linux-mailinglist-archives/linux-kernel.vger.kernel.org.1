Well the correct way would probably be:
"usage" -> "refs"
"live"  -> "users"

So we'd need a first patch to convert "usage" to "refs" and then
introduce "users".

or - at least briefyl - ptrace or whatever, yes.

I think I once looked that up and there was some sort of "not needed, no
gain" style rationale.

usage -> refs
live  -> users/active
