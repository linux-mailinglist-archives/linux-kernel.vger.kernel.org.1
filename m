This was already discussed and already changed to sched_uclamp_used which
I will post in v3, which is already ready.

The logic has changed. We return immediately now.

Do you think we need to execute the rest of the code if bucket->tasks is 0? It
would be good to know if there's a corner case you're worried about. AFAIU if
it is 0, this means there's nothing to do.

If it means a lot to you, I could put it back as it was. I just don't see why
we can't return immediately instead.

It does. The comment says if we use unlikely() when uclamp is not used we'll
incur an extra jump/branch. Hence we use likely to avoid this potential
overhead.

Aren't they both good enough?

Use of static_key_false() is deprecated AFAICS.

I'll defer to Peter here.

Re-purposing the sched_class->uclamp_enable means we can't use a static key and
we'll potentially still incur a cache penalty in there even if uclamp is not
used. Based on RT sysctl discussion, this won't be okay if we can do better.

I'm not sure we can agree on that. The overhead seems to be system specific. On
juno-r2 it seemed I$, but on 2 sockets systems it seems the D$. So I can't say
for sure no one will care. The current approach gives stronger guarantees.
