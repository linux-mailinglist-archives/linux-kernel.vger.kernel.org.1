Not quite true; it writes to t->kcov_area, and we need to make
absolutely sure that doesn't take faults or triggers anything else
untowards.

This thing; that appears to be the meat of it, right?

I can't find where t->kcov_area comes from.. is that always
kcov_mmap()'s vmalloc_user() ?

That whole kcov_remote stuff confuses me.

KCOV_ENABLE() has kcov_fault_in_area(), which supposedly takes the
vmalloc faults for the current task, but who does it for the remote?

Now, luckily Joerg went and ripped out the vmalloc faults, let me check
where those patches are... w00t, they're upstream in this merge window.

So no #PF from writing to t->kcov_area then, under the assumption that
the vmalloc_user() is the only allocation site.

But then there's hardware watchpoints, if someone goes and sets a data
watchpoint in the kcov_area we're screwed. Nothing actively prevents
that from happening. Then again, the same is currently true for much of
current :/

Also, I think you need __always_inline on kaslr_offset()


And, unrelated to this patch in specific, I suppose I'm going to have to
extend objtool to look for data that is used from noinstr, to make sure
we exclude it from inspection and stuff, like that kaslr offset crud for
example.

Anyway, yes, it appears you're lucky (for having Joerg remove vmalloc
faults) and this mostly should work as is.
