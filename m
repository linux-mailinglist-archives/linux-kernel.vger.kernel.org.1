Ok, thanks for the explanation. If we're just talking about multiple
instances of the same driver, why is it not sufficient to have a static
atomic_t initialised to -1 which tracks the current affinity and then just
CAS that during probe()? Hotplug notifiers can just check whether or not
it points to an online CPU
