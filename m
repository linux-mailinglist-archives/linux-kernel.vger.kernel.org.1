I'm not sure if I follow the question.

This proposal does not change the trigger for the warning printed when one
tries to both reserve CMA and pre-allocate gigantic pages.  If hugetlb_cma
is specified on the command line, and someone tries to pre-allocate gigantic
pages they will get the warning.  Such a command line on x86 might look like,
hugetlb_cma=4G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=4

You will then see,
[    0.065864] HugeTLB: hugetlb_cma is enabled, skip boot time allocation
[    0.065866] HugeTLB: allocating 4 of page size 1.00 GiB failed.  Only allocated 0 hugepages.

Ideally we could/should eliminate the second message.
This behavior exists in the current code.

Agree.  I am not proposing we do.  Sorry, if you got that impression.

Yes, that is the comment I was looking at as well.

However, note that hugetlb pre-allocation of gigantic pages will end up
calling memblock_alloc_range_nid.  This is the same routine used for CMA
reservations/allocations from cma_declare_contiguous_nid.  This is why
there should be no issue with doing CMA reservations at this time.

This may be the confusing part.  I am not saying we would do CMA reservations
and pre-allocations together.  Rather, they both rely on the underlying code so
we can call them at the same time in the init process.

I thought about it some more and came up with a way to do all this at command
line processing time.  It will take me a day or two to put together.

The patch from Barry which started this thread is indeed needed and is in
Andrew's tree.  I'll start another thread with a patch to move CMA reservations
to command line processing.
