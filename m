Wait.

Most of the patch in question is just substituting the code snippet's
leading white spaces to tabs. For illustration purposes, if we remove
these white space hunks from the diff, it becomes:

  --- a/include/linux/seqlock.h
  +++ b/include/linux/seqlock.h

Are you trying to tell me that, good heavens, these directives are
really hurting your eyes so much?

Putting kernel-doc aside... That huge raw_write_seqcount_latch() comment
is actually *way more readable from any text editor* after applying this
patch. Go figure.

>>> The correct fix is, as always, to remove the kernel-doc marker.

Sorry, that's not the correct fix.

In the following patches, kernel-doc for the entire seqlock.h API is
added. Singling out raw_write_seqcount_latch() doesn't make any sense.

If you look at the top of this patch series, a lot of seqlock.h
seqcount_t call sites were badly broken. The 0day kernel test bot sent
me even more erroneous call sites due to the added lockdep checks. This
is an extra argument for the added documentation: the existing one is
horrible.

So, please, don't claim that the current situation is fine. It is not.

Thanks,
