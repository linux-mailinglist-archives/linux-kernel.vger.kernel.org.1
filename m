OK, I think I have an explanation for the mechanism of the bug, and it
really is a combination of the 2008 bug (confusion of r0 vs r3) and
the SECCOMP_FILTER commit. When the syscall_trace_entry code path is
in use, a syscall with argument 5 having value -1 causes
do_syscall_trace_enter to return -1 (because it returns regs[0], which
contains argument 5), which the change in entry-common.S interprets as
a sign to skip the syscall and jump to syscall_exit, and things blow
up from there. In particular, SYS_mmap2 is almost always called with
-1 as the 5th argument (fd), and this is even more common on nommu
where SYS_brk does not work.

I'll follow up with a new proposed patch.
