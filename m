If

 s/in an SoC/in a single piece of silicon/

... then yes.

Right.  Unless all H/W is represented inside the CPLD, in which case
the CPLD is, in theory, the MFD.  Although, due to the nature of
CPLDs, this is a slippery slope.

You may want something like:

  arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-roc-pc-mezzanine.dts

... where the add-on board is represented separately (not in the
same hierarchical structure as the main board.  The main board is then
included as a DTSI from the add-on board.

It might also be worth looking at how consumer boards such as the
RaspberryPi, BeagleBoard and the like handle their add-on boards,
mezzanines, capes, hats, etc.
