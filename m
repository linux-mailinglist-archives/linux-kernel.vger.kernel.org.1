The problem is a fault on WRMSR doesn't mean the MSR doesn't exist, it only
means WRMSR faulted.  WRMSR can for all intents and purpose trigger completely
arbitrary microcode flows, e.g. WRMSR 0x79 can fundamentally change the
behavior of the CPU.

And it's not like the WRMSR->taint is atomic, e.g. changing a platform scoped
MSR that affects voltage settings or something of that nature could easily
tank the system on a successful WRMSR before the kernel can be marked tainted.

0400 only allows a privelged user to read the parameter, e.g. for parameters
that are snapshotted at module load time and/or changing the param while the
module is running would cause breakage.

0600 allows a priveleged user to read and write the parameter, which AFAICT
is safe here.

0644 allows a priveleged user to read and write the parameter, and allows an
unpriveleged user to read the param.
