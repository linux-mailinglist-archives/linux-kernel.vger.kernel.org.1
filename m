I can see *what* you're trying to do.  I was looking for an
explanation of *how* you think that will work.  FWIW, I don't think
what you're proposing will work as you envisage.  I thought that
perhaps I was missing something, which is why I requested further
explanation.

The problem is, how can you tell the difference between a valid and a
broken FDT without pre-processing - which, as I explained in the
commit message, I am not prepared to do.  We cannot test individually
since all configurations (e.g. no 'reg' property are valid on an
individual basis.

The best we can do is "best effort", to try and match each cell with
its requested OF node.
