Just like most of those so-called memory bus controllers we have under
drivers/memory/ => they are most of the time used to interact with
memories but can also be used for other things (Christophe listed a few
uses cases). And I'm not pushing one way or the other, all I said was
that we should makes things consistent instead of having half of
those controller drivers in drivers/memory/ and the other half in
drivers/bus/.
