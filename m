That's true.

But exactly this might deserve this comment. Otherwise people might
wonder why you can do a

    u32 divider = LOAD_AVG_MAX - 1024 + *cfs_rq*->avg.period_contrib;

and use it for instance in:

    *se*->avg.util_sum = se->avg.util_avg * divider;

In update_cfs_rq_load_avg() and reweight_entity() we derive 'divider'
from the same 'sched_avg' we use it on later.

    u32 divider = LOAD_AVG_MAX - 1024 + sa->period_contrib;

    sub_positive(&sa->load_sum, r * divider);

[...]
