It will solve that as well as for a tester doesn't have to go through all KUnit
tests fragments to turn them on.

We could also create a config fragment file in kernel/configs/kunit.config
where we set
------start
CONFIG_KUNIT=y
CONFIG_KUNIT_RUN_ALL=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR=y
------end


So, these two can only be enabled if KUNIT=y
CONFIG_KUNIT_DRIVER_PE_TEST=y
CONFIG_PM_QOS_KUNIT_TEST=y

and for this one we have a pre-request of SECURITY_APPARMOR=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR_KUNIT_TEST=y

Other tests solves the dependencies with 'select' like
CONFIG_EXT4_KUNIT_TESTS, that adds this row in
fs/ext4/Kconfig, 'select EXT4_FS'

But I think we should try to minimize the number of 'select' statements,
in order to avoid circular dependencies and unexpected behaviours.
Maybe we should add the CONFIG_EXT4_FS=y into the kunit.config
file instead ?

I agree!

I'll prepare a patchset with individual patches as was suggested by Marco
shortly.

Cheers,
