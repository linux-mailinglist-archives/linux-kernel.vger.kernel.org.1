There are other HiSilicom 6421 variants that don't use SPMI bus:

	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/hi6421.txt:       "hisilicon,hi6421-=
pmic";
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/hi6421.txt:       "hisilicon,hi6421v=
530-pmic";

The DT file on Kernel 4.9 uses hi6421v600 (although the schematics
from 96boards name it as hi6421v610).

While I don't mind much,would prefer to keep "spmi" on its name, in order
to distinguish this one from the non-spmi variants.

Maybe we use this for compatible:

	hisilicon,hi6421v600-spmi

This one is not part of the SPMI core. It is stored inside a private=20
structure inside at the HiSilicon spmi controller driver. It is stored=20
there as ctrl_dev->channel, and it is used to calculate the register offset
for readl():

	offset  =3D SPMI_APB_SPMI_STATUS_BASE_ADDR;
	offset +=3D SPMI_CHANNEL_OFFSET * ctrl_dev->channel + SPMI_SLAVE_OFFSET * =
sid;
	do {
		status =3D readl(base + offset);
	...

The SPMI bus is somewhat similar to I2C: it is a 2-wire serial bus
with up to 16 devices connected to it.

Now, most modern I2C chipsets provide multiple independent I2C
channels, on different pins. Also, on some chipsets, certain
GPIO pins can be used either as GPIO or as I2C.

I strongly suspect that this is the case here: according with
the Hikey 970 schematics:

	https://www.96boards.org/documentation/consumer/hikey/hikey970/hardware-do=
cs/files/hikey970-schematics.pdf

The pins used by SPMI clock/data can also be used as GPIO.

While I don't have access to the datasheets for Kirin 970 (or any other
chipsets on this board), for me, it sounds that different GPIO pins
are allowed to use SPMI. The "spmi-channel" property specifies
what pins will be used for SPMI, among the ones that are
compatible with MIPI SPMI specs.

I can try porting spmi schema to yaml on a separate patch,
and submit it independently of this series.

What about:

  spmi-channel:

      number of the SPMI channel at the HiSilicon SoC that will
      be used for the MIPI SPMI controller.

After doing a deeper look at the code which handles IRQs on this PMIC,
I'm considering to get rid of two properties: irq-num and irq-array.

See, the code does this:

	/* During probe time */
	pmic->irqs =3D devm_kzalloc(dev, pmic->irqnum * sizeof(int), GFP_KERNEL);

	/* While handling IRQs */
	for (i =3D 0; i < pmic->irqarray; i++) {
		pending =3D hi6421_spmi_pmic_read(pmic, (i + pmic->irq_addr));
		pending &=3D 0xff;

		for_each_set_bit(offset, &pending, 8)
			generic_handle_irq(pmic->irqs[offset + i * 8]);

	}

Right now, Hikey 970 sets:

	irq-num =3D <16>;
	irq-array =3D <2>;
	irq-mask-addr =3D <0x202>;
	irq-addr =3D <0x212>;

=46rom the above code, it sounds to me that irq-array is the number of
bytes used for IRQ, while irq-num is the number of bits. E. g:

	irq_num =3D  irqarray * 8;

So, we can get rid of at least one of them.

Going further, the code provides an special treatment for some IRQs:

	#define HISI_IRQ_KEY_NUM		0
	#define HISI_IRQ_KEY_VALUE		0xc0
	#define HISI_IRQ_KEY_DOWN		7
	#define HISI_IRQ_KEY_UP			6

	for (i =3D 0; i < pmic->irqarray; i++) {
		pending =3D hi6421_spmi_pmic_read(pmic, (i + pmic->irq_addr));

	...
		/* solve powerkey order */
		if ((i =3D=3D HISI_IRQ_KEY_NUM) &&
		    ((pending & HISI_IRQ_KEY_VALUE) =3D=3D HISI_IRQ_KEY_VALUE)) {
			generic_handle_irq(pmic->irqs[HISI_IRQ_KEY_DOWN]);
			generic_handle_irq(pmic->irqs[HISI_IRQ_KEY_UP]);
			pending &=3D (~HISI_IRQ_KEY_VALUE);
		}

As the values for HISI_IRQ_KEY_DOWN and HISI_IRQ_KEY_UP don't
depend on irqarray, it sounds to me that this is actually hardcoded=20
for irqarray =3D=3D 2.

So, I'll just get rid of those, replacing them by some defines inside
the code. If needed later, this patch can always be reverted.

> > +  'irq-mask-addr':
> > +    description: Address for the interrupt request mask
> > +
> > +  'irq-addr':
> > +    description: Address for the interrupt request =20

Those two seems more standard to me: irq-mask-addr is the address to
enable/disable IRQs, while irq-addr is where the pending IRQs are
stored.

What would be the standard way to specify them both?

True. This should be, instead:

	patternProperties:
          '^ldo[0-9]+@[0-9a-f]+$': =20

The name part of the property would better to stay in decimal,
as it makes a in order to match the public schematics:

	https://www.96boards.org/documentation/consumer/hikey/hikey970/hardware-do=
cs/files/hikey970-schematics.pdf

Using decimal values, the dmesg matches the schematics helps a lot when
dealing issues related to PM, as the names of the LDO lines will match
page 12 the schematics:

	ldo3: 1500 <--> 2000 mV at 1800 mV normal=20
	ldo4: 1725 <--> 1900 mV at 1800 mV normal idle=20
	ldo9: 1750 <--> 3300 mV at 2950 mV normal idle=20
	ldo15: 1800 <--> 3000 mV at 2950 mV normal idle=20
	ldo16: 1800 <--> 3000 mV at 2950 mV normal idle=20
	ldo17: 2500 <--> 3300 mV at 2500 mV normal idle=20
	ldo33: 2500 <--> 3300 mV at 2500 mV normal=20
	ldo34: 2600 <--> 3300 mV at 2600 mV normal=20
	ldo4: disabling
	ldo33: disabling

So, from above, looking at the datasheet, it is clear that
ldo33 - e. g. PCIe Switch VDD25 - is disabled.

It is needed. However, this is at the second file of the DT.

See, as SPMI is actually a bus, the entire DT setting has 3
parts:
  - the SPMI controller;
  - the PMICs;
  - the regulators.

A complete example is:

	spmi: spmi@fff24000 {
		compatible =3D "hisilicon,spmi-controller";
		#address-cells =3D <2>;
		#size-cells =3D <0>;
		status =3D "ok";
		reg =3D <0x0 0xfff24000 0x0 0x1000>;
		spmi-channel =3D <2>;

		pmic: pmic@0 {
			compatible =3D "hisilicon,hi6421-spmi-pmic";
			slave_id =3D <0>;
			reg =3D <0 SPMI_USID>;

			#interrupt-cells =3D <2>;
			interrupt-controller;
			gpios =3D <&gpio28 0 0>;
			irq-mask-addr =3D <0x202>;
			irq-addr =3D <0x212>;

			regulators {
				#address-cells =3D <1>;
				#size-cells =3D <0>;

				ldo3: ldo3@16 {
					reg =3D <0x16>;
					vsel-reg =3D <0x51>;

					regulator-name =3D "ldo3";
					regulator-min-microvolt =3D <1500000>;
					regulator-max-microvolt =3D <2000000>;
					regulator-boot-on;

					enable-mask =3D <0x01>;

					voltage-table =3D <1500000>, <1550000>,
							<1600000>, <1650000>,
							<1700000>, <1725000>,
							<1750000>, <1775000>,
							<1800000>, <1825000>,
							<1850000>, <1875000>,
							<1900000>, <1925000>,
							<1950000>, <2000000>;
					off-on-delay-us =3D <20000>;
					startup-delay-us =3D <120>;
				};
				...
			};
		};
	};

The child nodes are at the regulator DT properties.

Well, I can drop those from here, adding them only at the regulator's
part, using "bus { ... };".

Yes, I know. I was in doubt if I should either place vsel-reg on
a separate property or together with reg. I ended keeping it
in separate on the submitted patch series.

What makes more sense?

At least for the LDOs supported on HiKey 970, values for
"reg" and "vsel-reg" are unique: each LDO has their own.

Right now, enable-mask is 0x01 for all LDOs at the Hikey 970
DTS. However, only 8 LDOs are currently present at the DTS. From
the schematics, it sounds that HiSilicon 6421v600 supports
at least 37 lines. I've no idea if enable-mask remains the same
for the other ones, nor if "reg" and "vsel-reg" won't be
unique in the general case.

I considered that. However, I've no idea about the values and
ranges for the other 29 LDOs. So, without knowing better about
this silicon, I prefer to keep those at DT.

Good point. I'll double-check this one, but I guess you're right.

This is a left-over. I dropped this one, in favor of "vsel-reg"
(plus a mask for the voltage-table size).

What about:
	hisilicon,kirin970-spmi-controller=20

Those belong to the SPMI controller. Maybe I did some mess trying to
split up DT in order to place the Kirin970 SPMI bus controller on
one file, and the HiSilicon 6421v600 on another one.

I ended needing to duplicate some things, as otherwise the DT checks fail.

Basically, the full DT is:

	spmi: spmi@fff24000 {
		/* Kirin 970 SPMI controller props */

		pmic: pmic@0 {
			/* HiSilicon 6421v600 PMIC props */

			regulators {
				ldo3: ldo3@16 {
					/* HiSilicon 6421v600 ldo3 regulator props */
				};
				ldo4: ldo3@17 {
					/* HiSilicon 6421v600 ldo4 regulator props */
				};
				...
				ldo34: ldo3@33 {
					/* HiSilicon 6421v600 ldo34 regulator props */
				};
			};
		};
	};

Thanks,
Mauro
