Conceptually yes there is no difference but there is no *divine
restriction* to not make a difference if there is a real world
use-case which would benefit from it.

Actually we always make assumptions on how the feature we implement
will be used and as new use-cases come the assumptions evolve.

For "sweep before tear down" use-case this is not a corner case.

*Potentially* useful for debugging versus actually beneficial for
"sweep before tear down" use-case. Also I am not saying to make "no
dumps for memory.max when no eligible tasks" a set in stone rule. We
can always reevaluate when such information will actually be useful.

Johannes/Andrew, what's your opinion?
