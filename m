Hmm... that's frustrating.

Mea culpa.  Apologies for this.

As you know this is unheard of from me.

Let me give you my 'reason' (I know there is no 'excuse').

I've been grafting on an attempt to rid the kernel of W=1 warnings
this cycle.  Starting with MFD then working through Backlight, SCSI,
Regulator, RemoteProc, IIO, USB, Misc, Pinctrl, GPIO, etc etc, I've
managed to extinguish almost 3000 warnings to date.  I hope to do
something similar this cycle.

Anyway, I forgot to turn W=1 off when testing MFD.  I saw that there
were a couple of warnings, but I (stupidly) assumed that these were
just residue W=1 issues that I would clean-up next cycle.  Not
realising there were 2 real 'unused variable' problems present.

Could I please urge you to reconsider.  The branch is well tested (in
-next, by private 'kernel test robot' tests and by extensive TuxBuild
testing).  I have cleaned up the offending line (it was just one line
causing the 2 new 'unused variable' issues) and all of my tests are
now passing (with W=1 turned off).  The branch also extinguishes well
over 100 W=1 warnings to boot.  It certainly does more good than
harm.

If you decide stick with your decision however, I'll also understand.
