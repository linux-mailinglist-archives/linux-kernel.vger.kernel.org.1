Good question. It's not a crystal clear line in between them, I think.

A power domain to me, means that some part of a silicon (a group of
controllers or just a single piece, for example) needs some kind of
resource (typically a power rail) to be enabled to be functional, to
start with. If there are operating points involved, that's also a
clear indication to me, that it's not a regular regulator.

Maybe we should try to specify this more exactly in some
documentation, somewhere.

Okay, thanks!

Kind regards
