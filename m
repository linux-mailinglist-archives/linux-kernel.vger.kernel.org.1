I of course did grep of the terms before making this patchset.  There are so
many uses of the term, and therefore I thought it would be very hard and
painful to replace the whole words.  Of course, I also found some miuse of the
terms and therefore I thought automatic scripting for the replacement also
wouldn't make sense.

That's why I made gives only warning to future patches.   What this patch aims
to do is avoiding the further spread of the terms, and incremental replacements
to better terms, rather than the one point buggy and risky replacement.

Agreed, 'denylist' would also not fit in there.  That said, this patchset will
warn even such case so that people can think once again and find better term.
So, I agree this patch is imperfect for many cases, but better than nothing.
