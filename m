Sorry for not making my idea clear, perhaps it's complete garbage.

Right, but setting the flag is an indication that the tasklist_lock
will be taken and removed from the list, and therefore we could
optimistically avoid considering that task altogether instead of
relying on the old copy of the list. It's not perfect, but it does
reduce the window in which getpriority() can return a stale value(?).

At least this is how I justify it. Otoh this also opens a window in
where the lockless version can ignore highest prio task when the locked
version would otherwise consider it. So it might not be worth it.

Yes, that would need fixing but you don't seem to be buying the idea
in the first place.

Thanks,
