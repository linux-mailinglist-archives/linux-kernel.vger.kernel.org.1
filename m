I think I need some explanation about the rcu_read_lock() usage in 
lock_page_lruvec*() (and places effectively opencoding it).
Preferably in form of some code comment, but that can be also added as a 
additional patch later, I don't want to block the series.

mem_cgroup_page_lruvec() comment says

  * This function relies on page->mem_cgroup being stable - see the
  * access rules in commit_charge().

commit_charge() comment:

          * Any of the following ensures page->mem_cgroup stability:
          *
          * - the page lock
          * - LRU isolation
          * - lock_page_memcg()
          * - exclusive reference

"LRU isolation" used to be quite clear, but now is it after 
TestClearPageLRU(page) or after deleting from the lru list as well?
Also it doesn't mention rcu_read_lock(), should it?

So what exactly are we protecting by rcu_read_lock() in e.g. lock_page_lruvec()?

         rcu_read_lock();
         lruvec = mem_cgroup_page_lruvec(page, pgdat);
         spin_lock(&lruvec->lru_lock);
         rcu_read_unlock();

Looks like we are protecting the lruvec from going away and it can't go away 
anymore after we take the lru_lock?

But then e.g. in __munlock_pagevec() we are doing this without an rcu_read_lock():

	new_lruvec = mem_cgroup_page_lruvec(page, page_pgdat(page));

where new_lruvec is potentionally not the one that we have locked

And the last thing mem_cgroup_page_lruvec() is doing is:

         if (unlikely(lruvec->pgdat != pgdat))
                 lruvec->pgdat = pgdat;
         return lruvec;

So without the rcu_read_lock() is this potentionally accessing the pgdat field 
of lruvec that might have just gone away?

Thanks,
Vlastimil
