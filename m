So Dietmar's pointing out that sd will always be NULL for want_affine,
because want_affine can only be true at wakeups and we don't have any
topologies with SD_BALANCE_WAKE anymore. We would still want to call
wake_affine() though, because that can change new_cpu.

What you are adding on top is that the only sd field used in wake_affine()
is the imbalance_pct, so we could take a shortcut and just go for the
highest domain with SD_WAKE_AFFINE; i.e. something like this:

---
if (want_affine) {
        // We can cache that at topology buildup
        sd = highest_flag_domain(cpu, SD_WAKE_AFFINE);

        if (cpumask_test_cpu(prev_cpu, sched_domain_span(sd) &&
            cpu != prev_cpu)
                new_cpu = wake_affine();

        // Directly go to select_idle_sibling()
        goto sis;
}

// !want_affine logic here
---

As for the !want_affine part, we could either keep the current domain walk
(IIUC this is what you are suggesting) or go for the extra cached pointers
I'm introducing.

Now if we are a bit bolder than that, because there are no more
(mainline) topologies w/ SD_BALANCE_WAKE, we could even turn the above
into:

---
if (wake_flags & WF_TTWU) {
        if (want_affine) {
                // We can cache that at topology buildup
                sd = highest_flag_domain(cpu, SD_WAKE_AFFINE);

                if (cpumask_test_cpu(prev_cpu, sched_domain_span(sd) &&
                    cpu != prev_cpu)
                        new_cpu = wake_affine();

        }
        // Directly go to select_idle_sibling()
        goto sis;
}

// !want_affine logic here
---

This in turns mean we could get rid of SD_BALANCE_WAKE entirely... I'm a
bit more reluctant to that only because the last SD_BALANCE_WAKE setter was
removed fairly recently, see
  a526d466798d ("sched/topology: Remove SD_BALANCE_WAKE on asymmetric capacity systems")
