OK, fair enough.  I guess I just really don't understand how it could
work if an architecture didn't do this, but perhaps it would be clear
if there was code demonstrating it.  ;-)

OK, I give in.  Posted v2 doing it how I think you want it.

Hrm, maybe.  I guess it depends on whether we want to take baby steps
there or try to do it all at once.  If we take baby steps we will
occasionally fall down but we'll slowly start getting things cleaned
up.  If we wait for a full rewrite then we might be waiting for a long
time.  It'll also be harder to figure out which of the big changes in
the major rewrite broken someone.  ...or if the major rewrite comes in
20 small/bisectable patches it may be hard to revert patch 2 out of 20
if the future patches all build upon it.  If we do one small high-risk
change and then wait before building upon it then it'll be easy for
someone to bisect and then yell for a revert.
