The problem with doing it at free is that it would be just as
expensive as doing it at allocation, only you would likely see it in
more cases as more applications are more likely to free all of their
memory at once on exit, while only a few will pin all of their pages
at the start.

I wonder if it wouldn't make more sense to look at the option of
splitting the initialization work up over multiple CPUs instead of
leaving it all single threaded. The data above was creating a VM with
64GB of RAM and 32 CPUs. How fast could we zero the pages if we were
performing the zeroing over those 32 CPUs? I wonder if we couldn't
look at recruiting other CPUs on the same node to perform the zeroing
like what Dan had originally proposed for ZONE_DEVICE initialization a
couple years ago[1].

Thanks.
