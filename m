Dear Beloved

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I 
believe everyone will die someday. My Name is Mrs Aimi Jack, I'm an 
epidemiology Working at the Honolulu COVID 19 Emergency Hospital in 
Honolulu, Hawaii USA. I have been diagnosed Positive Of The Coronavirus 
Pandemic Around The World. due to my Kindness in caring for Infected 
Patient, I accidently Got Infected. It has defiled all forms of 
medicine, and right now I have only about a few weeks to live, according 
to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared 
for anyone not even myself but my Work. Though I am very rich, I was 
never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my 
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all 
this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have 
or make all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I 
would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that 
God ! has called me, I have willed and given most of my properties and 
assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few 
close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have 
decided to give alms (MONEY) to charity organizations, as I want this to 
be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed 
money to some charity organizations in the UK, Algeria and Malaysia. Now 
that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any 
more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and 
distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in USA 
and EUROPEAN COUNTRY, they refused and kept the money to themselves. 
Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended 
with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of 
twenty Eight million and Nine Hundred Thousand dollars($8,9000,000) that 
I have in Union Bank. I will want you to help me collect this deposit as 
my next of kin and dispatched it to charity organizations.


I have set aside 40% for you for your time and patience. If you are 
willing to help me, Please Reply..


I am currently admitted in the HOSPITAL .


Awaiting Your Response
Mrs Aimi Jack
