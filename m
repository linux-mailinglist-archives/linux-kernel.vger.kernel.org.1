Subject: [PATCH v4 0/3] SCMI System Power Support

Hi all,

this series wants to add the core SCMI System Power support and related
events' handling logic: the protocol support itself is trivial and boils
down to some bare initializations and supporting one SCMI System Power
notification event meant to carry platform-originated System transition
requests. This is patch [1/3].

On top of this a new SCMI driver has been developed which registers for
such System Power notification and acts accordingly to satisfy such
plaform system-state transition requests that can be of forceful or
graceful kind.

In order to comply with such graceful requests, and co-operate with
userspace entities to drive a clean shutdown/reboot, the logic of the
driver relies on the same orderly_* API methods used by ACPI when handling
ACPI Shutdown bus events.
As an alternative method to tunnel graceful requests to userspace it is
possible to configure, via available module parameters, a specific signal
to be sent to CAD pid. This is patch [2/3].

Patch [3/3] is a mere JUNO example of the minimal DT bindings needed to
enable the protocol at the DT level and is NOT meant to be upstream as of
now.

Based on scmi-next/for-next/scmi on top of:

commit 08fc3399646a ("firmware: arm_scmi: Add base notifications support")

Thanks

Cristian

----
v3 --> v4
- rebased on top of scmi-next/for-next/scmi 5.8-rc3 
- fixed some strict checkpatch issues

V2 --> V3
- changed Kconfig to fix naming and defaulting System Power Control
  driver to n
- fixes related to changes in SCMI Notifications core support V10

V1 --> V2
- use common event enums
- introduced optional alternative signal based comms 2 userspace
