True, I will make it something like :

"Prepare the TPIU driver to make use of the CoreSight device access
abstraction layer. The driver touches the device even before the
coresight device is registered. Thus we could be accessing the
devices without a csdev. As we are about to use the abstraction
layer for accessing the device, pass in the access directly
to avoid having to deal with the un-initialised csdev.

The patch 02 is not touching how the individual drivers access the
device, yet. It only sets the way by introducing the layer. As per
the proposed change, this is a preparation of the TPIU driver, so
that we can convert the generic helper functions ( coresight_timeout())
more easily and keep the patch 05 easier for review (just like the Patch
4, which prepares the ETM driver).

Cheers
