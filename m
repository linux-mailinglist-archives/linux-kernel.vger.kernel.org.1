Right, I misunderstand the spin_lock in memory barrier. Thanks a lot
for point out this.
So, is this patch fine to fix the problem?

Subject: [PATCH] mm/rmap: stop store reordering issue on page->mapping

Hugh Dickins and Minchan Kim observed a long time issue which
discussed here, but actully the mentioned fix missed.
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150504031722.GA2768@blaptop/
The store reordering may cause problem in the scenario:

	CPU 0						CPU1
   do_anonymous_page
	page_add_new_anon_rmap()
	  page->mapping = anon_vma + PAGE_MAPPING_ANON
	lru_cache_add_inactive_or_unevictable()
	  spin_lock(lruvec->lock)
	  SetPageLRU()
	  spin_unlock(lruvec->lock)
						/* idletacking judged it as LRU
						 * page so pass the page in
						 * page_idle_clear_pte_refs
						 */
						page_idle_clear_pte_refs
						  rmap_walk
						    if PageAnon(page)

Johannes give detailed examples how the store reordering could cause
a trouble:
The concern is the SetPageLRU may get reorder before 'page->mapping'
setting, That would make CPU 1 will observe at page->mapping after
observing PageLRU set on the page.

1. anon_vma + PAGE_MAPPING_ANON

   That's the in-order scenario and is fine.

2. NULL

   That's possible if the page->mapping store gets reordered to occur
   after SetPageLRU. That's fine too because we check for it.

3. anon_vma without the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON bit

   That would be a problem and could lead to all kinds of undesirable
   behavior including crashes and data corruption.

   Is it possible? AFAICT the compiler is allowed to tear the store to
   page->mapping and I don't see anything that would prevent it.

That said, I also don't see how the reader testing PageLRU under the
lru_lock would prevent that in the first place. AFAICT we need that
WRITE_ONCE() around the page->mapping assignment.
