That is a reasonable high-level summary.

Unless I am missing something subtle, the problem with this approach
is that in production-environment CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y kernels, there
is no way at runtime to distinguish between holding a spinlock on the
one hand and holding a raw spinlock on the other.  Therefore, without
some sort of indication from the caller, this approach will not make
CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y users happy.

I will confess that I found this approach quite attractive, at least
until I dug into it.  But it runs up against the inability to distinguish
between holding a spinlock and holding a raw spinlock.  This inability
shows up in non-debugging CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y kernels.  (Specifically,
production kernels of this type will have CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT=n.)

I will always have a warm spot in my heart for RT, but this
CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y&&CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT=n configuration is still
very important.

Exactly, and avoiding changing this semantic for current users is
precisely why we are proposing some sort of indication to be passed
into the allocation request.  In Uladzislau's patch, this was the
__GFP_NO_LOCKS flag, but whatever works.
