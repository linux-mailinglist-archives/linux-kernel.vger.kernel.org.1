I think part of the of the reason for not using an enum in the syscall
code is that part of is is (was?) used from assembly code. In our
case, I'm pretty sure we won't go back to handling calls from asm any
time soon, so a generated enum (and associated function pointer array)
would be better.

We assumed that we wouldn't get a function pointer in the first 4kB,
and documented as such in hyp.S. I would say that either we keep the
current convention of leaving the first 4k function codes for the
hyp-stubs, or we drop any sort of gap.

Another thing to consider is that there is at least *one* external
hypervisor (Jailhouse) that uses the stubs, so I'd like to make sure
we don't break that (even if we made no promise whatsoever in that
respect).

Ah, you're right. I got confused between _SIZE and _END.

So let's try to build it with an enum instead, and see if it works. If
it doesn't, at least we will know why.

Ah! Looking forward to reviewing it then!
