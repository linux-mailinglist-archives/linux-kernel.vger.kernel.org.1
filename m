DAMON[1] can be used as a primitive for data access awared memory management
optimizations.  For that, users who want such optimizations should run DAMON,
read the monitoring results, analyze it, plan a new memory management scheme,
and apply the new scheme by themselves.  Such efforts will be inevitable for
some complicated optimizations.

However, in many other cases, the users would simply want the system to apply a
memory management action to a memory region of a specific size having a
specific access frequency for a specific time.  For example, "page out a memory
region larger than 100 MiB keeping only rare accesses more than 2 minutes", or
"Do not use THP for a memory region larger than 2 MiB rarely accessed for more
than 1 seconds".

This RFC patchset makes DAMON to handle such data access monitoring-based
operation schemes.  With this change, users can do the data access aware
optimizations by simply specifying their schemes to DAMON.

Evaluations
===========

We evaluated DAMON's overhead, monitoring quality and usefulness using 25
realistic workloads on my QEMU/KVM based virtual machine.

DAMON is lightweight.  It increases system memory usage by only -0.39% and
consumes less than 1% CPU time in most case.  It slows target workloads down by
only 0.63%.

DAMON is accurate and useful for memory management optimizations.  An
experimental DAMON-based operation scheme for THP, 'ethp', removes 69.43% of
THP memory overheads while preserving 37.11% of THP speedup.  Another
experimental DAMON-based 'proactive reclamation' implementation, 'prcl',
reduces 89.30% of residential sets and 22.40% of system memory footprint while
incurring only 1.98% runtime overhead in the best case (parsec3/freqmine).

NOTE that the experimentail THP optimization and proactive reclamation are not
for production, just only for proof of concepts.

Please refer to the official document[1] or "Documentation/admin-guide/mm: Add
a document for DAMON" patch in the latest DAMON patchset for detailed
evaluation setup and results.

More Information
================

We prepared a showcase web site[1] that you can get more information.  There
are

- the official documentations[2],
- the heatmap format dynamic access pattern of various realistic workloads for
  heap area[3], mmap()-ed area[4], and stack[5] area,
- the dynamic working set size distribution[6] and chronological working set
  size changes[7], and
- the latest performance test results[8].

Baseline and Complete Git Tree
==============================


The patches are based on the v5.6 plus v11 DAMON patchset[1] and Minchan's
``do_madvise()`` patch[2].  Minchan's patch was necessary for reuse of
``madvise()`` code in DAMON.  You can also clone the complete git tree:

    $ git clone git://github.com/sjp38/linux -b damos/rfc/v9

The web is also available:
https://github.com/sjp38/linux/releases/tag/damos/rfc/v9

There are a couple of trees for entire DAMON patchset series.  It includes
future features.  The first one[3] contains the changes for latest release,
while the other one[4] contains the changes for next release.

[4] https://github.com/sjp38/linux/tree/damon/next


Sequence Of Patches
===================

The first patch allows DAMON to reuse ``madvise()`` code for the actions.  The
second patch accounts age of each region.  The third patch implements the
handling of the schemes in DAMON and exports a kernel space programming
interface for it.  The fourth patch implements a debugfs interface for the
privileged people and programs.  The fifth patch implements schemes statistics
feature for easier tuning of the schemes and runtime access pattern analysis.
The sixth patche adds selftests for these changes, and the seventhe patch adds
human friendly schemes support to the user space tool for DAMON.  Finally, the
eighth patch documents this new feature in the document.
