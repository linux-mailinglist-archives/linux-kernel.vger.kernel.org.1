Hi Moritz:

Could you please help review the patchset when you have time?

You have already reviewed the first 3 patches some time ago. The
comments are all fixed. Hao and Redhat guys also have done several
rounds of review. The patches are all Acked-by Hao, reviewed by
Marcelo & Tom.

There is little change to the code for several months, seems it stays
ready and just need your final Ack.

Actually this is the last feature for our first generation PAC A10 Card,
and is important for users to have the full support.

We really need your help on code review ...

Many thanks!
Yilun
