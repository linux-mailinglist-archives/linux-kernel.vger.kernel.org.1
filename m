commit 12a67ffb3e63c40027e251b44b2abc77463dc2da (HEAD -> dd-v3)

    dyndbg: export ddebug_exec_queries

    Exporting ddebug_exec_queries will allow module authors using dynamic
    debug to actually control/enable/disable their own pr-debug callsites
    dynamically.

    With it, module authors can tie any update of their internal debug
    variables to a corresponding ddebug_exec_queries invocation, which
    will modify all their selected callsites accordingly.

    Generally, authors would exec +p or -p on some subsets of their set of
    callsites, and leave fmlt flags for user to choose the appropriate
    amount of structural context desired in the logs.

    Depending upon the user needs, the module might be known, and
    therefore a waste of screen width, function would be valuable, file
    would be long and familiar to the author, etc..  That said, author
    could harness the message-prefix facility if they saw fit to do so.
    Any author preferences can be overridden with echo >control

    Is it safe ?

    ddebug_exec_queries() is currently 'exposed' to user space in
    several limited ways;

    1 it is called from module-load callback, where it implements the
      $modname.dyndbg=+p "fake" parameter provided to all modules.

    2 it handles query input from >control directly

    IOW, it is "fully" exposed to local root user; exposing the same
    functionality to other kernel modules is no additional risk.

    The other big issue to check is locking:

    dyndbg has a single mutex, taken by ddebug_change to handle >control,
    and by ddebug_proc_(start|stop) to span `cat control`.  ISTM this
    proposed export presents no locking problems.

    drm use case:

    drm.debug=0x03 appears to be a kernel boot-arg example, setting 2
    internal debug flags.  Each bit is probably controlling a separate
    subset of all debug-prints, they may be overlapping subsets.

    Those subsets are *definitely* expressible as a few dyndbg queries
    each.  Any arbitrary subset is.

       drm.dyndbg='file drm_gem_* +p'       # gem debug
       drm.dyndbg='file *_gem_* +p'         # *gem debug

    With this proposed export, drm authors could exec these examples, most
    likely in the callback that handles updates to the drm.debug variable.
(END)

I should note that none of this needs the WIP patch
