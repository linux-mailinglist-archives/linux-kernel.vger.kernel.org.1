xsaves is the critical part here.  FWIW, the breakage first appeared in

commit 91c3dba7dbc199191272f4a9863f86ea3bfd679f

    x86/fpu/xstate: Fix PTRACE frames for XSAVES
    
    XSAVES uses compacted format and is a kernel instruction. The kernel
    should use standard-format, non-supervisor state data for PTRACE.

The b0rken part is
+       for (i = 0; i < XFEATURE_MAX; i++) {
+               /*
+                * Copy only in-use xstates:
+                */
+               if ((header.xfeatures >> i) & 1) {
+                       void *src = __raw_xsave_addr(xsave, 1 << i);
+
+                       offset = xstate_offsets[i];
+                       size = xstate_sizes[i];
+
+                       ret = xstate_copyout(offset, size, kbuf, ubuf, src, 0, count);
+
+                       if (ret)
+                               return ret;
+
+                       if (offset + size >= count)
+                               break;
+               }
+
+       }

The skipped parts are left uninitialized.  I'm not sure what's the best
way to deal with that.  Sure, we can zero the buffer passed to ->get().
However, most of the instances (and I'd looked through quite a few)
do _not_ leave uninitialized chunks.  So I would rather have
xstateregs_get() zero the gaps explicitly.  I'll try to put together
a sane fix when I get some sleep.

FWIW, what I'm going to do is
	* make all callers of copy_regset_to_user() pass 0 as pos
(there are very few exceptions - one on arm64, three on sparc32
and five on sparc64; I hadn't dealt with arm64 one yet, but all
cases on sparc are handled)
	* switch copy_regset_to_user() to doing all copyout at
once - allocate a buffer, pass it to ->get(), then copy_to_user()
the entire thing, same as coredump does
	* introduce
struct membuf {
	void *p;
	size_t left;
};
static inline int membuf_zero(struct membuf *s, size_t size)
static inline void membuf_align(struct membuf *s, int n)
static inline int membuf_write(struct membuf *s, const void *v, size_t size)
and membuf_store(s, v) (basically, write the value of v to the damn thing,
with sizeof(v) for size).
	* introduce
typedef int user_regset_get2_fn(struct task_struct *target,
				const struct user_regset *regset,
				struct membuf to);
and
	user_regset_get2_fn             *get2;
in user_regset, replacing ->get().  Instances would be using the
membuf_...() primitives for actual copying.
	* convert the instances.  I've done that for several architectures,
and it's _much_ cleaner than the current mess with ->get().
	* get rid of user_regset_copyout() et.al. once there's no
callers left.

This bug clearly needs to be fixed in a way that would be easy
to backport, so it has go in front of that queue.  I'll try to
come up with a clean fix and post it (hopefully tomorrow)...
