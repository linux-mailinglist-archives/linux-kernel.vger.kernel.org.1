How to use:
append softwareseq=1 while probe the driver.
example:
modprobe intel-spi writeable=1 softwareseq=1
it will let driver use software sequence to write register for opt=EN4B
by default it's 0 if not specified, driver will do usual HW cycle

Why this parameter is posted to user:
Intel PCH provides two groups of registers for SPI flash operation,
Hard Sequence registers and Software Sequence registers,
corresponding to intel_spi_hw_cycle() and intel_spi_sw_cycle()
respectively in driver code. But HW sequence register won't send EN4B
opcode to SPI flash. BIOS code use SW register to send EN4B.

On some Cisco routers, two 32M SPI flashes, which require 4-byte address mode enabled,
are physically connected to an FPGA, one flash is active and one is inactive.
When we do BIOS upgrade, we need switch to the inactive one,
but unfortunately, this one is still 3-byte address mode as default,
after we do real-time switch, we need reload SPI driver to send EN4B code to
enable 4-byte address mode.

Refering to our BIOS code, Software sequence register is processed
while sending EN4B opcode. So here we use sw_cycle in driver for EN4B as well.

Why I don't just easily use software sequence for all:
1.It will impact all flash operation, include flash W/R, high risk
2.The only SPI type I can use is INTEL_SPI_BXT according to datasheet,
  this will require using hw seq.
  I tried to specify other SPI type, it couldn't work with Intel PCH.
  If I force SW seq for all, during boot up, sw_cycle fails to read
  vendor ID.

In conclusion, I only use SW cycle for EN4B opcode to minimize impact.
It won't impact other users as well.

Why the default flash can work at 4-byte address mode:
BIOS sets 4-byte address mode for the current active SPI flash with SW seq registers.
So we don't need append softwareseq=1 for normal boot up script,
it will only be used in BIOS upgrade script.
