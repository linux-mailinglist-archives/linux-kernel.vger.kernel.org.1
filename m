Note that smp_call_function_single() doesn't use _async(), and while it
does use per-cpu CSDs, the reqular .wait=false case then potentially
waits before (instead of after) in the unlikely case the local CSD was
already taken.

This makes that we cannot use it with IRQs disabled.

Probably -- like I said, I'm not really happy with this either.

I'm not sure I get the "expensive irq_work queues" argument, I fully
agree with you that adding the atomic op is fairly crap.

The remote irq_work is exactly same llist and IPI vector as remote
smp_call_function_single(). And the new irq_work_queue_remote_static()
is exactly as cheap as smp_call_function_single_async() for not having
an atomic op, queues to the same llist, sends the same IPI, but uses the
embedded data structure instead of pass a data pointer pattern.

Because most of the async users end up having another data structure to
pass arguments around anyway.

Well, I did use the CSD's wrong. I forgot the gotcha and made a mess of
things and stuff crashed, the wreckage is in the git history :/ I fixed
it, but I got burned.

I then went and looked at a bunch of other _async users and it wasn't
immediately obvious that they were doing it right (they were).

I wanted to improve things, but I'm willing to admit to just making it
worse in these last few patches.

Anyway, the pattern I wanted is more easily expressed with the new
irq_work_queue_remote(), even though I don't need it anymore. I can
throw away all the patches after that without loosing too much sleep.
