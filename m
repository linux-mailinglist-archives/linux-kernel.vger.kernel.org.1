OK, I will bite.  What is "rcl"?  A placeholder for donecbs and pendcbs?
If so, please just name them both.  If not, please explain.

Please also mention why ->len is handled specially at all, namely
interactions between rcu_barrier() and callback invocation.  This is
the answer to "why not just make all this work like normal lists?"
This might go well in the first paragraph.

Given that both rcu_segcblist_xchg_len() and rcu_segcblist_extract_count()
have only one callsite each, why not get rid of one of them?

Or better yet, please see below, which should allow getting rid of both
of them.

Rather than adding the blank lines, why not have the rcu_cblist structures
carry the lengths?  You are already adjusting one of the two call sites
that care (rcu_do_batch()), and the other is srcu_invoke_callbacks().
That should shorten this function a bit more.  And make callback handling
much more approachable, I suspect.

There would still be the callback-invocation need to be careful with
->cblist.len due to rcu_barrier() and srcu_barrier().  But both of
those should be excluded by this code.  (But don't take my word for it,
ask KCSAN.)

							Thanx, Paul
