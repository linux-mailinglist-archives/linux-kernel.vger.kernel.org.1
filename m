hmpf, so that made me insist a bit on this test on my patch and I see
a problem with that as well. The me from a few years ago was good!

With that said I'll want to work a bit more on this, so feel free to
base off master and I'll deal with rebase if required.

Part of me thinks it's the same bug that will be fixed with refcounting
and I just made it easier to hit, but I'm honestly unsure at this point
and testing would basically mean I just code what I asked you to...

Well, let me know if you want me to do the refcounting, but I'd rather
let you finish what you started. If possible put the patch first in the
series so commits can be tested independently.


Thanks,
