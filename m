Subject: [PATCH v2] blk-mq: Remove 'running from the wrong CPU' warning
Date:   Mon, 30 Nov 2020 11:19:21 +0100
Message-Id: <20201130101921.52754-1-dwagner@suse.de>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.16.4
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

It's guaranteed that no request is in flight when a hctx is going
offline. This warning is only triggered when the wq's CPU is hot
plugged and the blk-mq is not synced up yet.

As this state is temporary and the request is still processed
correctly, better remove the warning as this is the fast path.

Suggested-by: Ming Lei <ming.lei@redhat.com>

v2:
  - remove the warning as suggested by Ming
v1:
  - initial version
