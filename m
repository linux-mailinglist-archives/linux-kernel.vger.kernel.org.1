This causes "dmesg -w" or "cat /dev/kmsg" to not print new messages after
dumping the current ring. I hit this on v5.5.9, v5.5.15, v5.6.3, and
Linus HEAD. This prints no "hi":

(sleep 1;echo hi > /dev/kmsg)& dmesg -w

...curiously, "strace dmesg -w" shows the data received once ^C is hit.

Jann pointed me to this patch. Applying it or reverting 1b710b1b10eff9d4
does fix it for me. However, Linus HEAD is still broken and, AFAICS,
remains unreverted and unfixed in stable/linux-5.4.y through linux-5.6.y.
It was introduced in 5.6 but backported to those, not just the LTS above.
