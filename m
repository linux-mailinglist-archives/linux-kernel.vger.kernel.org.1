I now understand your point. But I still believe that repeated DSB in
the middle of cache maintenance wastes redundant CPU cycles. Avoiding
that redundancy causes extra complexity to implmentation of dma API. But
I think it is valuable.

Unfortunately, we have no in-tree driver to show the performance.
Instead, we just evaluated the speed of dma_sync_sg_for_device() to see
the improvements of this patch.
For example, Cortex-A55 in our 2-cluster, big-mid-little system gains 28%
(130.9 usec. -> 94.5 usec.) during dma_sync_sg_for_device(sg, nents,
DMA_TO_DEVICE) is running with nents = 256 and length of each sg entrh is 4KiB.
Let me describe the detailed performance results in the next patch
series which will include some fixes to errata in commit messages.

I agree. But due to the H/W cost, proposals about coherent DMA are
always challenging.

We are also trying to use non-cacheable buffers for the non-coherent
DMAs. But the problem with the non-cacheable buffer is CPU access speed.
