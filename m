Or malicious hypervisor action, and that's a problem.

Suppose the hypervisor remaps a GPA used in the SYSCALL gap (e.g. the
actual SYSCALL text or the first memory it accesses -- I don't have a
TDX spec so I don't know the details).  The user does SYSCALL, the
kernel hits the funny GPA, and #VE is delivered.  The microcode wil
write the IRET frame, with mostly user-controlled contents, wherever
RSP points, and RSP is also user controlled.  Calling this a "panic"
is charitable -- it's really game over against an attacker who is
moderately clever.

The kernel can't do anything about this because it's game over before
the kernel has had the chance to execute any instructions.
