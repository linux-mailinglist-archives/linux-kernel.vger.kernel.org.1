Absolutely, these events really help in quantifying THP migration successes
or their failures that involve splitting.

Agreed.

Is there any other failure reasons which are only specific to THP migration.
Else, adding stats about generic migration failure reasons will just blur
the overall understanding about THP migration successes and failure cases
that results in splitting.
