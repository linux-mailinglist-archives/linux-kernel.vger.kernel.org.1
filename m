For hackbench yes (shorter is better); for perf bench sched no, since the
metric here is ops/sec so higher is better.

That said, I (use a tool that) run a 2-sample Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test
against the two sample sets (tip/sched/core vs tip/sched/core+patch), and
the p-value for perf sched bench is quite high (~0.9) which means we can't
reject that both sample sets come from the same distribution; long story
short we can't say whether the patch had a noticeable impact for that
benchmark.

With hackbench -g 4 that's 160 tasks (against 32 CPUs, all under same LLC),
although the work done by each task isn't much. I'll try bumping that a
notch, or increasing the size of the messages.

That's ~1.2s of "extra" CPU time per second, which sounds pretty cool.

I don't think I've ever played with uperf. I'll give that a shot someday.
