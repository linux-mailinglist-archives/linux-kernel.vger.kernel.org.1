They have. Here's where the most recent one in my inbox ended, which has 
breadcrumbs to a couple more:

Note the author ;)

 From memory, all the previous attempts wound up getting stuck on the 
subtlety that buffers from hcd_alloc() may or may not actually have come 
from the DMA API. Since then, the localmem_pool rework has probably 
helped a bit, but I'm not sure we've ever really nailed down whether 
kmalloc()ed buffers from PIO-mode controllers (i.e. the !hcd_uses_dma() 
case) can end up down this devio path.
