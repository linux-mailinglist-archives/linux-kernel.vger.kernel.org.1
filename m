Is "arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-gru-scarlet-inx.dts" what you
wanted? The FDT in use is the one that's present in the kernel tree for
the same revision. The one with the `compatible` property with a bunch
of `google,scarlet-rev*-sku6`. The build process for the kernel
partition (booting using depthcharge) ensures they are in sync always.

In any cases, from previous discussions with people involved with the
scarlet development, the only difference between all scarlets are the
display on some (innolux vs. kingdisplay). I would expect (and hope)
the issue would be the same on all.

I did not, I thought earlyprintk was earlycon... I had:

  console=ttyS2,115200n8 earlyprintk=ttyS2,115200n8

Now with wither "earlycon" or "earlycon=uart8250,mmio32,0xff1a0000" I
somehow can't get any output, and it's not booting. That is with and
without the problematic patch, and also verified on v5.8. Odd.

So I would say that I don't have earlycon, and maybe can't? I'm open to
suggestions.

On top of v5.9-rc2 + revert d1ac0002dd297069bb8448c2764c9c31c4668441

  $ curl https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/[...]/raw | git am

With the patch, with and without (the probably bad) earlycon, I get
the same result, hang at boot, no serial output.

Again, knowing that the hardware is not necessarily in the hands of
everyone, I'll be glad to try patches and configurations proposed to
further the understanding of the issues.
