Qais, Peter, all,

For ChromeOS (my team), we are planning to use the upstream uclamp mechanism
instead of the out-of-tree schedtune mechanism to provide EAS with the
latency-sensitivity (binary/ternary) hint. ChromeOS is thankfully quite a bit
upstream focussed :)

However, uclamp is missing an attribute to provide this biasing to EAS as we
know.

What was the consensus on adding a per-task attribute to uclamp for providing
this? Happy to collaborate on this front.

thanks,

 - Joel
