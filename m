The right solution is a mechanism for translated guests to query Xen to
find regions of guest physical address space which are unused, and can
be safely be used for foreign/grant/other  mappings.

Please don't waste any more time applying more duct tape to a broken
system, and instead spend the time organising some proper foundations.
