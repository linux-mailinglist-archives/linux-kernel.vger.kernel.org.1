I said this on another thread, but almost always, when we get reports
like this on security@k.o, we do push them back to public lists.

For the most part, this paragraph is not going to help much (mostly for
the reason that no one seems to read it, but that's a different
topic...)  We get crazy reports all the time, and that's fine, because
sometimes, there is a real issue in some of them.  And for that, we do
want to be careful.  We also have many docuemented "off-by-one" bugs
that were real security issues (there's a blog post somewhere about how
a developer turned such a bug into a root hole, can't find it right
now...)

So while I understand the temptation here, based on the current
security@k.o traffic, I doubt this will really change much :(

Also, you should have cc:ed that group when you are changing things that
will affect them.

thanks,
