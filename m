In another reply, I give reasoning why it would be safe to call even later
at hugetlb command line processing time.

> 1. N_MEMORY mask is guaranteed to be initialized at arch_initcall()

This is a bit more difficult to guarantee.  I find the init sequence hard to
understand.  Looking at the arm code, arch_initcall(hugetlbpage_init)
happens after N_MEMORY mask is setup.  I can't imagine any arch code setting
up huge pages before N_MEMORY.  But, I suppose it is possible and we would
need to somehow guarantee this.

> 2. CMA reservation is available to be called at arch_initcall()

Since I am pretty sure we can delay the reservation until hugetlb command
line processing time, it would be great if it was always done there.
Unfortunately, I can not immediately think of an easy way to do this.
