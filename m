Thanks!

[1/2] ASoC: tlv320adcx140: Fix GPO register start address
      commit: 806a8afedef82c5f156b1c9b1de1205f9abfd21e
[2/2] ASoC: tlv320adcx140: Move device reset to before programming
      commit: 982f4a4134893cd48c466e7a56422d7c65837d10

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark
