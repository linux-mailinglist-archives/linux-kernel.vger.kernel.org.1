(not seeing the original report in the archives or my list copy)

I'm assuming it's some sort of dodgy virt setup, actual real proper
hardware should never get here like that.

Right, so that's not supposed to happen, as you say, we should not
enable this code if the ratio is 0, and we should not overflow mcnt due
to reading that reg once per tick.

But yeha, virt, anything can happen :/

Yeah, we can certainly modify that. As is, real actual hardware should
never even hit that case either. So we might as well move that check and
then also make it disable all this frequency scaling stuff if we ever do
hit it.
