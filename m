Early sections establish a memmap for the full section. There's
conceptually nothing wrong with unplugging the non-system-RAM portion
of the memmap, but it would need to be careful, at least on x86, to
map the partial section with PTEs instead of PMDs.

So, you are right that there is a mismatch here, but I think the
comprehensive fix is to allow early sections to be partially
depopulated/repopulated rather than have section_activate() and
section_deacticate() special case early sections. The special casing
is problematic in retrospect as section_deactivate() can't be
maintained without understand special rules in section_activate().
