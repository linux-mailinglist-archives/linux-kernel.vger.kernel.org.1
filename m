OK, so to summarize:

1. We will have one driver: "drivers/nvmem/qfprom.c"

2. If the driver detects that its reg is pointing to the corrected
address space then it should operate in read-only mode.  Maybe it can
do this based on the compatible string being just "qcom,qfprom" or
maybe it can do this based on the size of the "reg".

3. If that driver sees a newer compatible string (one that includes
the SoC name in it) it will assume that its "reg" points to the start
of qfprom space.

4. We should post patches to transition all old dts files away from
the deprecated bindings.

I don't know much about this versioning info, but I'm curious: can we
read it from the chip?  If so then it actually _doesn't_ need to be in
the compatible string, I think.  Device tree shouldn't include things
that can be probed.  So if this can be probed then maybe we could have
the compatible as:

compatible = "qcom,msm8996-qfprom", "qcom,qfprom"

...where the SoC is there just in case we need it but we'd expect to
just match on "qcom,qfprom" and then probe.


If this can't be probed then having the version info is nice, so then
I guess you'd have the compatible string:

compatible = "qcom,msm8996-qfprom", "qcom,qfprom-5.1.0"

...where (again) you'd have the SoC specific string there just in case
but you'd expect that you could just use the generic string.


Does that sound right?

Yeah, I was thinking we probably wanted a read-only property.  That
sounds sane to me.
