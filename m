To be honest, I was surprised as well because.. yes, I know that these 
RCGs seem to need it, but then their clock tables don't contain any 
reference to the gpll0 divider, hence it's never getting used - and that 
works great, for now.

I am aware of the fact that the clocks that you've mentioned are using 
the divider to reduce jitter, but I haven't done any camera test on my 
devices yet: that's definitely in my plans and I really can't wait to do 
that (as I successfully did for SDM630/660), but... we have more than 
100 patches in our trees.
We need to get upstream in the same working order as what we have here, 
so that we don't diverge that much and our work is kept in a 
maintainable state (avoiding to lose pieces around).

I'm sure that I'll send a commit adding the gpll0 divider branch as soon 
as I will start the camera work: I feel it, it's going to give me issues 
without, in that field.

By the way, noted. I'll make sure to add you in the to/cc for all of the 
next series regarding 8998 that I'll send.

Meanwhile, you may want to check out all the recent patches that I've 
sent, as like 90% are MSM8998-centric... :))
