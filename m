Right. Andrew, can you please add the following para to the changelog?

Why not fix the stats by including both the global and cgroup reclaim
activity instead of exposing root cgroup's memory.stat? The reason is
the benefit of having metrics exposing the activity that happens
purely due to machine capacity rather than localized activity that
happens due to the limits throughout the cgroup tree. Additionally
there are userspace tools like sysstat(sar) which reads these stats to
inform about the system level reclaim activity. So, we should not
break such use-cases.
