Thanks.

It makes no difference, at least on my gcc10 which seems to be smart enough to
do the right thing. But yeah, your suggestion is more readable and precise and
maybe can work better with a less smart compiler. Thanks.

Subject: [PATCH] mm, page_alloc: use unlikely() in task_capc()

Hugh noted that task_capc() could use unlikely(), as most of the time there is
no capture in progress and we are in page freeing hot path. Indeed adding
unlikely() produces assembly that better matches the assumption and moves
all the tests away from the hot path.

I have also noticed that we don't need to test for cc->direct_compaction as the
only place we set current->task_capture is compact_zone_order() which also
always sets cc->direct_compaction true.
