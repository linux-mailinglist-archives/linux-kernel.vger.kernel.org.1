MADV_HUGEPAGE is controlling a preference for THP to be used for a
particular address range. So it looks similar but the historical
behavior is to control page faults as well and the behavior depends on
the global setup.

I've had in mind something much simpler. Effectively an API to invoke
khugepaged (like) functionality synchronously from the calling context
on the specific address range. It could be more aggressive than the
regular khugepaged and create even 1G pages (or as large THPs as page
tables can handle on the particular arch for that matter).

As this would be an explicit call we do not have to be worried about
the resulting latency because it would be an explicit call by the
userspace.  The default khugepaged has a harder position there because
has no understanding of the target address space and cannot make any
cost/benefit evaluation so it has to be more conservative.
