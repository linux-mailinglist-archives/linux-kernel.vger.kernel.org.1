I'm not the maintainer here so it's not really up to me, but this is why
we have the Co-developed-by tag, to show that multiple people worked on
some patch. The patch is supposed to logically stand on its own
regardless of how many people worked on it. Authorship is a single
person but the Co-developed-by tag helps express that more than one
person is the actual author of the patch. Can you use that tag instead
and then squash this into the other DP patches?
