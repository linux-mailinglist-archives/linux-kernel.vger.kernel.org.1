"flags" is there to allow extensibility without requiring to add new
membarrier commands for every change. Even though it is not used now,
I don't think re-purposing it is a good idea. What is wrong with just
adding an additional "cpu" parameter to the system call ?

A "flags" parameter is very common for system calls. I don't see why
we should change its name, especially given it is already exposed and
documented as "flags" in man pages.

No. The "sync-core" is about doing context synchronization for JIts, and
is not implemented on all architectures today. RSEQ however is available
on a wider range of architectures.

We basically have the following feature matrix:

- private / global
- expedited / non-expedited
- sync-core / non-sync-core
- rseq-fence / non-rseq-fence

For a total of about 16 combinations in total if we want to support them
all.

We can continue to add separate commands for new combinations, but if we
want to allow them to be combined, using flags rather than adding extra
commands would have the advantage of keeping the number of commands
manageable.

However, if there is no actual use-case for combining a membarrier sync-core
and a membarrier rseq-fence, then it limits the number of commands and maybe
then it's acceptable to add the rseq-fence as a separate membarrier command.

I prefer to have this discussion now rather than once we get to the point of
having 40 membarrier commands for all possible combinations.

Thanks,

Mathieu
