Isn't the interrupt supposed to latch in the hardware in this scenario?
We wanted to wakeup from UART RX over GPIO, and we did, and we also
wanted to send that data through the pin to the UART core, so I suspect
we muxed it as a UART pin and also watched it for an irq wakeup in the
GPIO driver and PDC? The wakeup irq handler can be ignored by the UART
driver if it wants.

Why should it be kept disabled at the PDC and GIC when the system is out
of suspend? Is that because software hasn't enabled the irq yet upon
resume and we're waiting for the irq consumer driver (EC for example) to
do that?

In the CPU idle path (i.e. the system isn't suspending) I'd expect the
PDC and GIC hwirqs to be enabled so that the interrupt can trigger at
anytime. This is the normal mode of operation. When the CPU goes to
idle, and for that matter all the CPUs go to idle, the PDC should still
be monitoring the irqs that are enabled with irq_enable() and wake up
the CPU to receive the irq by taking all the CPUs out of deep idle
states where the GIC is powered off. If the irq is disabled with
irq_disable(), I'd think we would want to disable in the PDC so that the
irq doesn't wake us up from idle unnecessarily.

Long story short, CPUs going in and out of idle and system not
suspending or freezing for s2idle means the PDC enable state should
follow irq enable state and completely ignore wake state. During system
suspend or freezing for s2idle the PDC enable state should follow wake
state. The tricky part is making sure the suspend and resume path
doesn't miss some interrupt that would have woken us up.

I thought that maybe lazy irq disable would save us here. The PDC
monitored irq could be disabled in software during suspend but not
actually disabled in hardware, so the irq could still latch. If it does
latch during suspend then we'll abort suspend either via hardware or
software detecting this case. Once we hit the end of suspend, we can
disable the PDC interrupts that aren't marked for wakeup. Implicitly,
the other interrupts that are marked for wakeup are already enabled
because they must have been lazily disabled or left enabled during
suspend. On the resume path we may have enabled some PDC interrupt for
wakeup that wasn't supposed to be enabled because software disabled it,
but it's all lazy so if it didn't trigger it doesn't matter, just let it
trigger later and if it does genirq will mask it appropriately and mark
it as pending.

Great! I'm glad you're interested in enabling s2idle.

Actually no it doesn't. It looks like the irqchip irq_suspend() and
irq_resume() ops are only called when the driver uses the generic
irqchip implementation. That doesn't look to be used here. Good point
about the syscore ops and s2idle interaction, but it's not the real
reason why these ops can't be used.

Maybe we can always call the ops from somewhere deep in the suspend path
instead of using a notifier. That may make it simpler to reason about
and fix the s2idle problem at the same time. Putting it into a notifier
is difficult to understand and could potentially have a problem if
something like the timer irq needs to stay enabled until the end of
suspend but our suspend ops turn it off. That's what syscore is
typically important for. It gets the callback out of the path where
interrupts are still enabled and could potentially interfere with the
irqchip being disrupted. Maybe suspend_device_irqs() can be extended
here. I'm not sure.
