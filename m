Can you give some examples of how you will be able to describe the
hardware involved in powering/clocking resources surrounding your
remoteproc and the necessary resources in a "simpler and vendor neutral"
way that then can be further lopped(?) into something that Linux can use
to control any remoteproc?

In my view the big reason for the fragmentation between bindings is
because they all describe different hardware. There has been common
properties of remoteprocs discussed, but apart from the firmware-name
property I don't think we have agreed on any.

If your remoteproc uses a mailbox for signaling, then this should be
described in devicetree. This will allow you to reuse components in
other designs where either part is replaced or reused.
