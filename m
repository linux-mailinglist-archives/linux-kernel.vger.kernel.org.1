I know that. This is the reason that I said 'no direct connection'. The ano=
n
list size is directly related the *possible* file list size. But,
active/inactive
separation in one list is firstly based on *current* list size rather than
the possible list size. Adding anon list size to detect workingset means
to use the possible list size and I think that it's wrong.

I understand your purpose and agree with it. We need to find a solution.
To achieve your goal, my suggestion is:

- refault distance < active file, then do activation and add up IO cost
- refault distance < active file + anon list, then add up IO cost

This doesn't break workingset detection on file list and challenge
the anon list as the same degree as you did.

It could cause thrashing for your patch. Without the patch, current logic t=
ry to
find most hottest file pages that are fit into the current file list
size and protect them
successfully. Assume that access distance of 50 MB hot file pages is 60 MB
which is less than whole file list size but larger than inactive list
size. Without
your patch, 50 MB (hot) pages are not evicted at all. All these hot
pages will be
protected from the 100MB low access frequency pages. 100 MB low access
frequency pages will be refaulted repeatedely but it's correct behaviour.

However, with your patch, 50 MB (hot) file pages are deactivated due to new=
ly
added file pages with low access frequency. And, then, since access distanc=
e of
50 MB (hot) pages is larger than inactive list size, they could not
get a second chance
and finally could be evicted. I think that this is a thrashing since
low access frequency
pages that are not fit for current file list size pushes out the high
access frequency
pages that are fit for current file list size and it would happen
again and again.

Maybe, logic can be corrected if the patch considers inactive age of
anon list but
I think that my above suggestion would be enough.

Again, I agree with your goal. What I don't agree is the implementation
to achieve the goal.

Thanks.
