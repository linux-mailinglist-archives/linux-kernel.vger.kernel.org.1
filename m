Sorry but as far as I'm concerned, you've lost the right to have your
word in such design choices a long time ago. You can't deliberately lie
to us for several weeks/months and expect us to trust you (your
judgment) after that.

Back to the actual proposal, it's something that came from a discussion
we had with Miquel and Richard. It's certainly not perfect, but neither
is the option of hardcoding a quirk for JFFS2/UBI/UBIFS in the Micron
NAND driver.

BTW, I think you completely occluded Miquel's suggestion to have a
generic implementation at the MTD level for users who don't care about
the pattern that's written to those 'soon-to-be-erased' blocks. See,
that's one of the things I'm complaining about. You seem to ignore
(don't know if it's deliberate or not) some of the suggestions we do.

I don't understand what you mean here, sorry.

Yes, seriously!

Actually, you need more than Richard's blessing. Miquel has to agree on
the NAND changes, and even if I can't block the solution, I think I can
at least give my opinion: anything that involves FS/wear-leveling
specific code at the NAND level should be avoided. Given the discussion
we had regarding JFFS2 and the cleanmarkers, I don't think we can come
up with a solution that's safe for every users, hence the proposal to
empower users with this responsibility.
