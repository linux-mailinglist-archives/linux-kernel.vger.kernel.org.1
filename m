That should be fine. OF will keep searching from first till last for a
match.

You mean LED names. I would consider those ABI. People can have
scripts which configure the LEDs how they want, blinking heartbeat,
etc.

Well, it would break how i boot my wrt1900ac. I tftpboot it, grabbing
both the kernel and the DB blob from my TFTP server. If the blob
changes names, i would need to modify my uboot configuration. 

I don't know if Debian has full support for any of these boards, but
if i remember correctly, flash-kernel has a database of machine names
and DTB file names. My wrt1900ac is quite happy running Debian, but i
don't have it booting the Debian way, because i use it for kernel
hacking. But maybe there are people out there that do.
