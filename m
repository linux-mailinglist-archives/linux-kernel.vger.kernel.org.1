Thanks Mimi for looking at this patch set.

I added both "remotely" and "locally" in the description, so that
people less familiar with IMA would get a general overview of whats
possible with IMA.

In this patch set we are only adding support for measurement and
attestation. In the next iteration, I will remove the references to
"local" detection.
