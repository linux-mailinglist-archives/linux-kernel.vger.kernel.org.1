? The code path in question is usbdev_mmap() and the allocation is done 
~13 lines lines before as a usb_alloc_coherent().

That sort of makes sense, except for the above, and the fact that I 
would imagine the dma_mmap_coherent should be dealing with that case. 
I'm not really clear about the details of the GCE usb device here, but 
my first guess at this was the dma_pgprot() in dma_direct_mmap() is 
incorrectly picking a pgprot...
