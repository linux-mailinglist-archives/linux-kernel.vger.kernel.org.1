Right, I think we'd want to have that at the very least for 32bit anyway. I
haven't done the math, but doesn't it require an obscene amount of tasks
for that to still happen on 64bit with the increased resolution?

I don't fully grasp yet how much surgery that would require, but it does
sound like something we've been meaning to do, see e.g. se_weight:

 * XXX we want to get rid of these helpers and use the full load resolution.
