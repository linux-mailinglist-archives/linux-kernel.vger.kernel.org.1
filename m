Do you mean to call litex_get_reg() with 1 directly as a second argument instead
of using a defined value (which in the context of uart driver is 1 for
every register anyway)?

Sure, this is doable. We just thought a named define will explain
better what's going on.

In general case, register's offsets and sizes might differ between
LiteX configurations
(LiteX is an SoC generator capable of creating different setups) so
having a dynamic
size in litex_get_reg() is useful.
With this patchset we are targeting a single (default) configuration
(so it's enough for
OFF_ and SIZE_ to be fixed), but this could be extended to be more
dynamic in the future.

I meant that DRIVER_NAME define is used in the file in many places:
* liteuart_driver.driver_name
* liteuart_type()
* liteuart_platfrom_driver.driver.name
* liteuart_console.name
* MODULE_ALIAS
It's not shared with other drivers, but used multiple times in the
code of this one.

DEV_NAME/DRIVER_MAJOR/DRIVER_MINOR are indeed referenced only once so
it's no problem to write those values directly and get rid of their
defines.

I guess we'll be good without the UART type.

We'll check that up.

We'll remove this and see if everything works fine.
