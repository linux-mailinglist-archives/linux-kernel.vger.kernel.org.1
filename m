Hi Mani,

These are patches already reviewed, small and important and good to go:

bus: mhi: core: Abort suspends due to outgoing pending packets
bus: mhi: core: Use generic name field for an MHI device
bus: mhi: core: Introduce helper function to check device state
bus: mhi: core: Read and save device hardware information from BHI

Please let us know if you have any concerns.

Thanks,
Bhaumik
