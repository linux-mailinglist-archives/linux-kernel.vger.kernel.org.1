mmap operation for dma-noop (ancestor of dma-direct) was proposed
in [1]. It was suggested to change dma_common_map() instead which
was implemented in 

07c75d7a6b9e ("drivers: dma-mapping: allow dma_common_mmap() for NOMMU")

that removed CONFIG_MMU drom dma_common_mmap(). Later

62fcee9a3bd7 ("dma-mapping: remove CONFIG_ARCH_NO_COHERENT_DMA_MMAP")

reintroduced CONFIG_MMU in dma_common_mmap().

Even though commit mentions ARM, I do not see how mmap would continue
to work for NOMMU with dma-direct. ARM NOMMU needs it's own DMA operations
only in cases where caches are implemented or active, in other cases it
fully relies on dma-direct.

It looks to me that we either should provide NOMMU variant for mmap in
dma/direct or (carefully) fix dma/mapping.

Thoughts?
