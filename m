I tested hackbench on 24-CPU machine, here are the results:

"hackbench 20 thread 1000"

== orignal(without any patch)
Time: 53.793
Time: 54.305
Time: 54.073

== with my patch1~2
Time: 54.036
Time: 53.840
Time: 54.066
Time: 53.449

== with my patch1~2, plus using a percpu partial free objects counter
Time: 53.303
Time: 52.994
Time: 53.218
Time: 53.268
Time: 53.739
Time: 53.072

The results show no performance regression, it's strange that the
figures even get a little better when using percpu counter.

Thanks,
Xunlei
