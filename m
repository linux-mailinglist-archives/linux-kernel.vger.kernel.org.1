Hmm, that shouldn't be directly relevant, unless your SDEI watchdog is using the
bindable-irq thing?


If your firmware offers an event-id for the watchdog, please upstream the driver. Half of
the event-id space is reserved for vendor stuff like this.

If firmware needs to be told to re-configure the watchdog irq to make this work, then pNMI
is a much better fit. Having firmware and linux modifying the irqchip hardware is a
nightmare best avoided.

Okay, I'll pick this up to drop the module exports.

I'd prefer not to make all this static as these register/unregister calls are the
interface that is supposed to be used. If we are going to gut it, we should do it completely.


Thanks,

James
