I understand that and that's the reason I was introducing new field as
manufacture but I now see there is no point in adding that.

Agreed.

Fair enough.

IIUC, you are fine with "jep106:1234:5678" where 1234 is jep106 manufacture
id code and 5678 is soc_id as it may avoid all the conflicts across
the manufacture namespaces.

I understand, and IIUC you prefer this to be embedded with soc_id
especially to avoid namespace conflicts which makes sense.

Thanks for all the discussion and valuable inputs. I am now bit nervous
to add SoC info from SMCCC ARCH_SOC_ID to sysfs yet as we need more info
especially "machine" and "serial_number" for elsewhere(OEM firmware mostly
from DT or ACPI).


TBH, the mix might be bit of a mess as there are soc drivers that rely
on DT completely today. Anyways, this SOC_ID can be added as library that
can be used by a *generic* soc driver once we define a standard way to
fetch other information("machine" and "serial_number"). I am happy to
get suggestions on that front especially from you and Francois as you
have got some context already.
