But anyone can hook to a tracepoint, and then if they hook to one that is
in the page fault handler, and they use vmalloc, they can lock up the
machine.

What's so damn special about alloc_percpu()? It's definitely not a fast
path. And it's not used often.

I'll give the answer I gave to Joerg when he replied to my accidental
private (not public) email:

Or even my original patch would be better than having the generic tracing
code understanding the intrinsic properties of vmalloc() and
alloc_percpu() on x86_64. I really don't think it is wise to have:

	foo = alloc_percpu();

	/*
	 * Because of some magic with the way alloc_percpu() works on
	 * x86_64, we need to synchronize the pgd of all the tables,
	 * otherwise the trace events that happen in x86_64 page fault
	 * handlers can't cope with accessing the chance that a
	 * alloc_percpu()'d memory might be touched in the page fault trace
	 * event. Oh, and we need to audit all alloc_percpu() and vmalloc()
	 * calls in tracing, because something might get triggered within a
	 * page fault trace event!
	 */
	vmalloc_sync_mappings();

That would be exactly what I add as a comment if it were to be added in the
generic tracing code.

And we would need to audit any percpu alloc'd code in all tracing, or
anything that might git hooked into something that hooks to the page fault
trace point.

Since this worked for a decade without this, I'm strongly against adding it
in the generic code due to some issues with a single architecture.
