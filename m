Maybe I was being overly cautious. I was just trying to avoid adding
something called nvidia-arm-smmu which might eventually turn out to be
ambiguous if there was ever a non-Tegra chip and the ARM SMMU
implementation was not compatible with the one instantiated on Tegra.

Note that I have no knowledge of such a chip being designed, so this may
never actually become an issue.

In either case, the compatible string already identifies this as Tegra-
specific, so we could always change the driver name later on if we have
to.

The ARM SMMU replaced the Tegra SMMU on Tegra186 and later, so both
drivers are never going to run concurrently. The only "problem" might be
that both drivers have symbols with the same prefix, but since they
don't export any of those symbols I don't see how that would become a
real issue.

But then again, the Tegra SMMU is also technically an NVIDIA SMMU, so
sticking with the current name might also be confusing.

Perhaps a good compromise would be to use a "tegra194{-,_}smmu" prefix
instead, which would make this fairly specific to just Tegra194 (and
compatible chips). That's a fairly common pattern we've been following
on Tegra, as you can for example see in drivers/gpio/gpio-tegra186.c,
drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.c, drivers/memory/tegra/tegra186-emc.c, etc.
