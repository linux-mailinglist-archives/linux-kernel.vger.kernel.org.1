I see. I'll dig through the docs, thanks for the reference.

I don't think it's similar to what I was referring to. But my knowledge about
DL could have failed me to fully appreciate what you're saying.

This tunable for RT prevents a single task from using 100% CPU time. I think
DL uses it in a similar manner.

What I meant by overcommiting, is allowing more DL tasks than the system can
guarantee to meet their deadlines.

For example, in the context of capacity awareness, if you have 2 big cores, but
4 DL tasks request a bandwidth that can only be satisfied by the big cores,
then 2 of them will miss their deadlines (almost) consistently, IIUC.

This can be generalized on SMP (I believe). But judging from your earlier
response, it's not as straightforward as it seems :)

RT is the same. So this makes sense. Though one would hope to be able to
improve on this in the future. Something for me to ponder over :)

Thanks
