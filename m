The meaning of the bits is define in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_print.c:

MODULE_PARM_DESC(debug, "Enable debug output, where each bit enables a debug category.\n"
"\t\tBit 0 (0x01)  will enable CORE messages (drm core code)\n"
"\t\tBit 1 (0x02)  will enable DRIVER messages (drm controller code)\n"
"\t\tBit 2 (0x04)  will enable KMS messages (modesetting code)\n"
"\t\tBit 3 (0x08)  will enable PRIME messages (prime code)\n"
"\t\tBit 4 (0x10)  will enable ATOMIC messages (atomic code)\n"
"\t\tBit 5 (0x20)  will enable VBL messages (vblank code)\n"
"\t\tBit 7 (0x80)  will enable LEASE messages (leasing code)\n"
"\t\tBit 8 (0x100) will enable DP messages (displayport code)");

Wrappers using these id's are defined in include/drm/drm_print.h,
for example:

#define DRM_DEBUG_ATOMIC(fmt, ...)					\
	__drm_dbg(DRM_UT_ATOMIC, fmt, ##__VA_ARGS__)

or

#define drm_dbg_atomic(drm, fmt, ...)					\
	drm_dev_dbg((drm)->dev, DRM_UT_ATOMIC, fmt, ##__VA_ARGS__)

I do not understand this. Each category is used in many files and
some files use more categories at the same time:

   git grep DRM_DEBUG_

I am afraid that this will not work. It would be hard to maintain
especially when more categories are used in the same source file.

It would be needed some easy to use API:

   /*
    * Print message when this module and feature is enable in dynamic
    * debug interface.
    */
   pr_debug_feature(int feature_id, fmt, ...);  to print a part

   /* Enable/disable printing debugging messages, work during early boot??? */
   dd_enable_module_feature(char *module_name, int *feature_id);
   dd_disable_module_feature(char *module_name, int *feature_id);


Note that the enable/disable functions manipulates only the "p" flag
by intention. The module.debug option decides only whether the messages
should be printed or not.

IMHO, the other flags (flmt) should be global flags. It is too big
detail to be enabled per-message. IMHO, it just makes the interface
too complicated and over engineered.
