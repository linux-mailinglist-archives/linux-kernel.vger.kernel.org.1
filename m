Subject: [PATCH] mm, page_alloc: skip ->waternark_boost for atomic order-0 allocations
Date:   Tue, 19 May 2020 15:28:04 +0530
Message-Id: <1589882284-21010-1-git-send-email-charante@codeaurora.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 1.9.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When boosting is enabled, it is observed that rate of atomic order-0
allocation failures are high due to the fact that free levels in the
system are checked with ->watermark_boost offset. This is not a problem
for sleepable allocations but for atomic allocations which looks like
regression.

This problem is seen frequently on system setup of Android kernel
running on Snapdragon hardware with 4GB RAM size. When no extfrag event
occurred in the system, ->watermark_boost factor is zero, thus the
watermark configurations in the system are:
   _watermark = (
          [WMARK_MIN] = 1272, --> ~5MB
          [WMARK_LOW] = 9067, --> ~36MB
          [WMARK_HIGH] = 9385), --> ~38MB
   watermark_boost = 0

After launching some memory hungry applications in Android which can
cause extfrag events in the system to an extent that ->watermark_boost
can be set to max i.e. default boost factor makes it to 150% of high
watermark.
   _watermark = (
          [WMARK_MIN] = 1272, --> ~5MB
          [WMARK_LOW] = 9067, --> ~36MB
          [WMARK_HIGH] = 9385), --> ~38MB
   watermark_boost = 14077, -->~57MB

With default system configuration, for an atomic order-0 allocation to
succeed, having free memory of ~2MB will suffice. But boosting makes
the min_wmark to ~61MB thus for an atomic order-0 allocation to be
successful system should have minimum of ~23MB of free memory(from
calculations of zone_watermark_ok(), min = 3/4(min/2)). But failures are
observed despite system is having ~20MB of free memory. In the testing,
this is reproducible as early as first 300secs since boot and with
furtherlowram configurations(<2GB) it is observed as early as first
150secs since boot.

These failures can be avoided by excluding the ->watermark_boost in
watermark caluculations for atomic order-0 allocations.
