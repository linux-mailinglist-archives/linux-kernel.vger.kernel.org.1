I have stopped at patch 3 as all patches until then are really missing
any justification. What is the point for all this to be done? The code
is far from trivial and just shifting around sounds like a risk. You are
removing ~50 LOC which is always nice but I am not sure the resulting
code is better maintainble or easier to read and understand. Just
consider __ClearPageLRU moving to page_off_lru patch. What is the
additional value of having the flag moved and burry it into a function
to have even more side effects? I found the way how __ClearPageLRU is
nicely close to removing it from LRU easier to follow. This is likely
subjective and other might think differently but as it is not clear what
is your actual goal here it is hard to judge pros and cons.
