As Robin said, it is not SMMU callback but the normal reboot/shutdown
flow and race is unlikely at that point.

    tmc_shutdown()
     platform_drv_shutdown()
       device_shutdown()
        kernel_restart_prepare()
         kernel_restart()

If I am not clear enough, first all the consumer shutdown callbacks of 
SMMU
are called like above tmc_shutdown() and then we call the 
arm_smmu_device_shutdown(),
this ordering is ensured by the device links.

Thanks,
Sai
