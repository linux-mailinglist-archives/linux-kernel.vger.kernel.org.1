Thank you for looking into this!  Sounds like something I would do...
And unlike rcutorture, the timeframes are too short for throttling
to kick in.  Seems like the fix is instead to set to everything to
SCHED_OTHER while it is in torture_stutter().  I will give that a try.
Though perhaps the hrtimer sleep is better?

							Thanx, Paul
