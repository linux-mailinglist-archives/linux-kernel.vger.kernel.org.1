This whole codepath is only hit for binderfs binder devices which are
allocated in binderfs.c. Legacy binder devices allocated through the
misc device layer always have a reference count > 0. When they are
opened there refcount is inced by one and when they are put is deced by
1 since their refcount starts from 1 they're always guaranteed to be at
1. For binderfs binder devices they start with a refcount of 1 as well
and it is incremented when they are opened too but there's another dec on
their refcount when the binderfs instance is shutting down or when they
are deleted through inode eviction. If someone is still keeping the
binderfs device alive through proc-> then the final put can't happen
during inode eviction but must happen in binder_free_proc() instead.

Because there's no module_exit() for binder and with binderfs. Their
either "y" or "n". If you want to do this work then this can become a
little messy since you'd need to mess with userspace when you suddenly
invalidate all their references through a forced module unload.
