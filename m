Subject: [RFC PATCH 00/14] coresight: Support for ETMv4.4 system instructions

CoreSight ETMv4.4 introduced system instructions for accessing
the ETM. This also implies that they may not be on the amba bus.
Right now all the CoreSight components are accessed via memory
map. Also, we have some common routines in coresight generic
code driver (e.g, CS_LOCK, claim/disclaim), which assume the
mmio. In order to preserve the generic algorithms at a single
place and to allow dynamic switch for ETMs, this series introduces
an abstraction layer for accessing a coresight device. It is
designed such that the mmio access are fast tracked (i.e, without
an indirect function call).

This will also help us to get rid of the driver+attribute specific
sysfs show/store routines and replace them with a single routine
to access a given register offset (which can be embedded in the
dev_ext_attribute). This is not currently implemented in the series,
but can be achieved.

Further we switch the generic routines to work with the abstraction.
With this in place, we refactor the etm4x code a bit to allow for
supporting the system instructions with very little new code. The
changes also switch to using the system instructions by default
even when we may have an MMIO.

The series has been mildly tested on a model. I would really 
appreciate any testing on real hardware.

Applies on coresight/next tree. The tree is also available here :
