NXP -

Please don't let perfect be the enemy of the good.  We have some
patches floating around which enable much of the functionality.  It
may not be perfect, but it's an improvement from what we currently
have - which is nothing.  Please let the patches in, and when the
alternative methods become available, we can remove these.

If TF_A is arguing about how to push the patches upstream, then maybe
Tim is wright and it's not a good idea, and we should consider
something else.
