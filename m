Good day and God bless you as you read this massage, I am by name Faith
Laboso i'm 27 years old girl from Kenya, yes my Mother was Late Mrs. Lorna
Laboso the former Kenyan Assistant Minister of Home and affairs who was
among the plan that crash on board in the remote area of Kalong=E2=80=99s
westernKenya Read more about the crash with the below web site

http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html I am
constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment I am receiving from
my step mother. She planned to take away all my late mothers treasury and
properties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved mother. One day
I opened my mother brave case and secretly found out that my mother
deposited the sum of $ 27.5 million in BOA bank Burkina Faso with my name
as the next of kin, then I visited Burkina Faso to withdraw the money and
take care of myself and start a new life, on my arrival the Bank Director
whom I meet in person Mr. Batish Zongo told me that my mother left an
instruction to the bank, that the money should be release to me only when I
am married or I present a trustee who will help me and invest the money
overseas.

That is the reason why I am in search of a honest and reliable person who
will help me and stand as my trustee for the Bank to transfer the money to
his account for me to come over and join you. It will be my great pleasure
to compensate you with 30% of the money for your help and the balance shall
be my capital with your kind idea for me to invest under your control over
there in your country.

As soon as I receive your positive response showing your interest I will
send you my picture's in my next mail and death certificate of my Mon and
how you will receive the money in your account. Contact me though my Email:
(faithlabo117@gmail.com)
Yours Sincerely
Queen Faith Laboso
