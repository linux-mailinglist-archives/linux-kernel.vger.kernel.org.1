OK, I could change the print.

The version is not needed for uevent. The different formats of
uevents explain themselves (dfl v0 or dfl v1), is it?
If we add the dfl version in uevent then we should also add
the version in struct dfl_device_id, and all dfl driver should fill the
version info in its id_table. But actually that's redundent work to
driver developer.

The version in struct dfl_device may simplify the internal code on how
to format the uevent. But considering the only extension of dflv1 I
think checking the null uuid is also simply enough.

I think even we create struct resource array for dfl_devices, the dfl
driver still has to create and fill its pdev resource as needed. There
is little chance the driver could just memcpy them. So the dfl driver
could fill the irq resources of pdev according to ddev->irqs & num_irqs.

OK. It is invalid, I could error out in this case.
