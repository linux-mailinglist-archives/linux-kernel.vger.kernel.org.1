Depends a bit on what the hardware gets us. If for example we're
provided an interrupt on vblank start, then that could wake a DEADLINE
job with (given your numbers above):

 .sched_period = 16ms,
 .sched_deadline = 1-2ms,
 .sched_runtime = 1-2ms,

The effective utilization of that task would be: 1-2/16.

Or you can have it adjust it's expected runtime as the system runs
(always keeping a little extra room over what you measure to make sure).

Given you have period > deadline, you can simply start with runtime =
deadline and adjust downwards during use (carefully).
