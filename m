Sure, There are nothing to worry. I tried the following branches of the s=
table
tree. They all looks good in this regard.

    linux-5.6.y
    linux-5.5.y
    linux-5.4.y
    linux-5.3.y
    linux-4.19.y
    linux-4.9.y

linux-4.4.y isn't tried because the corresponding parameter starts to exi=
st
from linux-4.7.y: 1a2db300348b ("arm64, numa: Add NUMA support for arm64 =
platforms.")

    # git tag --contains 1a2db300348b | sort -V | head -n 3
    v4.7
    v4.7-rc1
    v4.7-rc2

In the experiment, the following pr_info() is added and I got same output
from above branches:

diff --git a/arch/arm64/mm/numa.c b/arch/arm64/mm/numa.c
index b1e42bad69ac..1e0e3491de54 100644

+       pr_info("=3D=3D=3D> numa_off=3D%s\n", numa_off ? "true" : "false"=
);
+

There is unrelated compiling warnings in linux-5.3.y:
