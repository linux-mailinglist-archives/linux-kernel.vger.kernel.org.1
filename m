>=20
> The power management framework on POWER systems include core idle
> states that lose context. Deep idle states namely "winkle" on POWER8
> and "stop4" and "stop5" on POWER9 can be entered by a CPU to save
> different levels of power, as a consequence of which all the
> hypervisor resources such as SPRs and SCOMs are lost.
>=20
> For most SPRs, saving and restoration of content for SPRs and SCOMs
> is handled by the hypervisor kernel prior to entering an post exit
> from an idle state respectively. However, there is a small set of
> critical SPRs and XSCOMs that are expected to contain sane values even
> before the control is transferred to the hypervisor kernel at system
> reset vector.
>=20
> For this purpose, microcode firmware provides a mechanism to restore
> values on certain SPRs. The communication mechanism between the
> hypervisor kernel and the microcode is a standard interface called
> sleep-winkle-engine (SLW) on Power8 and Stop-API on Power9 which is
> abstracted by OPAL calls from the hypervisor kernel. The Stop-API
> provides an interface known as the self-restore API, to which the SPR
> number and a predefined value to be restored on wake-up from a deep
> stop state is supplied.

Thanks for writing this up, it goes some way to help think about the=20
feature.

> Shortcoming1:
> ------------
> In a special wakeup scenario when a CPU is woken up in stop4/5 and

This seems like a shortcoming of the wakeup firmware that shouldn't need=20
any APIs to the kernel to solve, but the whole deep sleep wakeup seems=20
like a shortcoming so let's assume they won't do that for whatever=20
reason, then how much of a problem is this really? Are special wakeups=20
that frequent?

> Shortcoming2:
> ------------
> The value of LPCR is dynamic based on if the CPU is entered a stop
> state during cpu idle versus cpu hotplug.
> Today, an additional self-restore call is made before entering
> CPU-Hotplug to clear the PECE1 bit in stop-API so that if we are

> There is a overhead of an extra call

This is a self-restore call when we offline or online a CPU? That's not=20
a real problem either, is it?

> New Use-case:
> -------------
> In the case where the hypervisor is running on an
> ultravisor environment, the boot time is too late in the cycle to make
> the self-restore API calls, as these cannot be invoked from an
> non-secure context anymore
>=20
> To address these shortcomings, the firmware provides another API known
> as the self-save API. The self-save API only takes the SPR number as a
> parameter and will ensure that on wakeup from a deep-stop state the
> SPR is restored with the value that it contained prior to entering the
> deep-stop.
>=20

If the ultravisor is deployed in production only systems where we don't=20
use runtime deep-stop states, do we need to handle this case?

Thanks,
Nick
