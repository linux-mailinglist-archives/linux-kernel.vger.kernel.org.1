Yeah, I know how it is.  I love working on kgdb but I always have a
hard time putting it ahead of other tasks and there are always other
tasks.  Knowing that other people use it helps me, at least, and some
of my recent work on kgdb was because a whole pile of other people
were all discussing how to get kgdb working.  ;-)

OK, you make a fair argument.

Sure, though I think right now all of the non-kgdb stepping logic
already disables interrupts, right?  ...and the kgdb logic for single
step is (and has always been) very broken for arm64.  Unless there is
hope in the short or medium term of the "right" solution getting done,
it does feel like Wei Li's patches improve the situation...

Yeah, I think that's how I'll be most useful in this situation.  While
it'd be really cool to understand all the inner workings of this code,
realistically I don't have time and it's probably better for me to
treat it as a black box and just be useful as a tester of the end
result.

My first take would be the same argument I made for keeping IRQs off:
the fewer things that happen during single stepping the better.
