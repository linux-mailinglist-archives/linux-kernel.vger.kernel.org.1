That's fine since that case works here too. The commit message
should be adjusted though since the ST7703 data sheet i'm looking at says
there's no restriction about applying IOVCC and VCI (tRPW= +/- no
limit). You're basically also switching to another reset pattern (the
data sheet describes two). So instead of saying:

"Fix the power up sequence of the panel"

i'd rather say

"Pick a reset sequence that works for ingbangda,xbd599 panel too"

and then describe the changes since that helps us to identify later
on why we made that change. With that and 1/2 dropped that looks good to
me.
