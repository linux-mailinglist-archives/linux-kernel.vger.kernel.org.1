Any suggestions? Or more specifics about which part is conflicting? It
tries to say that there is a higher demand to succeed even though the
context cannot sleep to take active measures to achieve that. So the
only way to achieve that is to break the watermakrs to a certain degree
which is making them more "higher class" than other allocations.
