Found by script but done by hand.  Unfortuntely, I can't figure even a
hackish way to get Coccinelle to modify comments.  I guess I could have
used Coccinelle to print out a patch and then run that, but since the
result has to be checked anyway, I just made the changes by hand.

Hmm, maybe I interpreted the words slightly differently.  t looks like it
would be fine without the comma.

Sorry to have missed these.

Are there a lot of other such problems?  I did look through the whole
patch several times by hand, but perhaps it is just too big to see
everything.
