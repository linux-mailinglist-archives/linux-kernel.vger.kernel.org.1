AFAICT, this test is buggy and cannot possibly work. It attempts to
have SYS_getpid return a 64-bit value and check that the returned
value matches. On 32-bit archs this will be truncated to 32 bits, but
the comparison in the caller still compares against the full 64-bit
value. I have no idea how this seemed to work before.

This is similar to 51.

I think the commonality of all the failures is that they deal with
return values set by seccomp filters for blocked syscalls, which are
getting clobbered by ENOSYS from the failed syscall here. So I do need
to keep the code path that jumps over the actual syscall if
do_syscall_trace_enter returns -1, but that means
do_syscall_trace_enter must now be responsible for setting the return
value in non-seccomp failure paths.

I'll experiment to see what's still needed if that change is made.

I'd welcome any input, but I think I'm on track to solving this either
way.
