Okay, make sense then.

I see.

That's probably the case for some platforms, but I don't see why we
need to make everybody "suffer".

I think the splats can easily be fixed. Short term.

Adding RCU_NONIDLE (or similar) around pm_runtime calls in
psci_enter_domain_idle_state() does the trick. I have a patch for
that, it's tested and ready. Let me send it out.

Perhaps we should just accept that this is needed, as to allow us to
move step by step into a better situation, while also avoiding the
current splats.

I don't think that would help. Infrastructure for testing will just
enable that Kconfig anyway still complains to us.

Kind regards
