Since this line is driven by BT SoC, they could change their 
pull(although it's less likely). Recently on cherokee we worked with BT 
team and came to an agreement to keep no-pull from our side in order to 
not conflict with their pull in any state.

When we keep no-pull(floating), sometimes it may be pulled high and UART 
flow will be turned off(RFR_NOT_READY), due to this BT SoC wont be able 
to send data even though host is ready.
