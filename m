The workload we observed this in was downloading a large file and
writing it to disk, which means that a good chunk of that memory was
dirty. The first reclaim pass appears to make little progress because
it runs into dirty pages.

The same is true for memory.high. We are invoking the userspace OOM
killer when memory.high reclaim fails and we put tasks to sleep.

The actual number of retries is arbitrary, correct. That's because OOM
is arbitrary. It's a sampled state, and this is our sampling period.

But it's not that important. The much more important thing is that we
continue reclaiming as long as there is forward progress. How many
times we retry when there is no forward progress is less critical -
but it's nice to have the same cutoff for OOM situations everywhere.
