My clever/horrible/overly-complex idea was basically:

In execve:

 - After the point of no return, but before we start waiting for the
   other threads to go away, finish calculating our post-execve creds
   and stash them somewhere in the task_struct or so.
 - Drop the cred_guard_mutex.
 - Wait for the other threads to die.
 - Take the cred_guard_mutex again.
 - Clear out the pointer in the task_struct.
 - Finish execve and install the new creds.
 - Drop the cred_guard_mutex again.

Then in ptrace_may_access, after taking the cred_guard_mutex, we'd
know that the target task is either outside execve or in the middle of
execve, with old and new credentials known; and then we could say "you
only get to access that task if you're capable relative to *both* its
old and new credentials, since the task currently has both state from
the old executable and from the new one". (Other users that expect to
use cred_guard_mutex to synchronize with execve would also have to be
changed appropriately; e.g. seccomp tsync would have to bail out if
the task turns out to be in execve after the mutex has been acquired.)

So I think we can conceptually fix the deadlock, but it requires a bit
of refactoring. (I have an old branch somewhere in which I tried to
implement this, and where I did a bunch of refactoring around
ptrace_may_access() so that e.g. the LSM hooks for ptrace can be
invoked twice when the target task is in execve, and so that they take
the target's cred* as an argument.)
