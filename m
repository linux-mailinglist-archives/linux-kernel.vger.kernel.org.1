Initial problem was, during playback if device suspended, I2S and DMA 
control registers

are getting reset and unable to recover playback after resume.

As these registers were non volatile registers, driver is not getting 
actual register value

and unable to report error state to application. Due to this application

keeps on polling for HW current pointer state and not exited from PCM 
running state.

To handle this scenario I made registers volatile and if they are in 
reset state, reported error

to application(commit b1824968221c).

Later from review comments by Srinivas kandagatla, I got to know

about regcache sync APIs, which can be used  to sync cache after resume and

HW registers can be updated with  original values. With that playback 
can be continued.

So is the reason, I am reverting partial changes in the commit b1824968221c.
