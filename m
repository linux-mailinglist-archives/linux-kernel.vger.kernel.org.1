Yeah, I have collection of sparc32 machines that I played around with
once. Including one sun4d that I brought from a friendly Linux fellow in
the UK. But somehow I lost interest as this is all very nice machines
but not useful for anything real work.

I think we would be better served dropping support for sun4m and sun4d
from the kernel.

Last I suggested deleting sun4m/sun4d the argument to keep sun4m was that
QEMU supports sun4m - which is a good argument for sun4m. I dunno what
would be needed to migrate QEMU to LEON, see below.

LEON on the other hand could have some nice future. They are right now
stuck on an older kernel and someone that was motivated should be able
to get LEON4 running on latest upstream.
We had it working in the past - but is was around the time I lost my
sparc interest and no-one jumped in to move it much more forward.

So in other words - no complains for the plan you outline.
