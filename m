Ok, I've obviously misunderstood your comment instead ;)

Yes, so one option would be to attempt to validate that the VMM has 
provided memory pages with the PG_mte_tagged bit set (e.g. by mapping 
with PROT_MTE). The tricky part here is that we support KVM_CAP_SYNC_MMU 
which means that the VMM can change the memory backing at any time - so 
we could end up in user_mem_abort() discovering that a page doesn't have 
PG_mte_tagged set - at that point there's no nice way of handling it 
(other than silently upgrading the page) so the VM is dead.

So since enforcing that PG_mte_tagged is set isn't easy and provides a 
hard-to-debug foot gun to the VMM I decided the better option was to let 
the kernel set the bit automatically.

There's a "TCO" (Tag Check Override) bit in PSTATE which allows 
disabling tag checking, so if it's reasonable to wrap accesses to the 
memory you can simply set the TCO bit, perform the memory access and 
then unset TCO. That would mean a single mapping with MTE enabled would 
work fine. What I don't have a clue about is whether it's practical in 
the VMM to wrap guest accesses like this.

Yes, where the worst case is all bits set which is size/32. Since you 
don't know at the time of the call how many bits are going to be set I'm 
not sure how you would design the API which doesn't require 
preallocating the worst case.

Yes - you could derive a pointer which didn't perform tag checking. Note 
that this also requires the rest of user space to play along (i.e. 
understand that the tag value is reserved). I believe for user space we 
have to use the all-0s value which means that a standard pointer 
(top-byte is 0) would be unchecked.
