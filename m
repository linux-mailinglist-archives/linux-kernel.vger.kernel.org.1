I also made some thoughts on Games. Games definately was big factor for 
windows popularity. How much can we nixify this, and make it work for us?

In Available Source space, a good idea seems to be to consolidate game 
engine and graphics API, and also have a good subpixel precice 4K mode 
for accelerated desktop, low-jitter wise.

And have a universal level maker, where people could sell 10level style 
games for 20$ or something like that.
