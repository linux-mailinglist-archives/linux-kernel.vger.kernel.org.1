Agreed. I am just trying to think of how to better manage the strings,
which currently are rare and optional. That is where the dict_ring
becomes interesting.

Perhaps we should use both the fixed structs with the variable
dict_ring. printk_ext_info could look like this:

struct struct printk_ext_info {
    u64 ts_boot;
    u64 ts_real;
    char *process;
    char *subsystem;
    char *device;
};

And @process, @subsystem, @device could all point to null-terminated
trings within the dict_ring. So printk.c code looks something like this:

size_t process_sz = strlen(process) + 1;
size_t subsystem_sz = strlen(subsystem) + 1;
size_t device_sz = strlen(device) + 1;
struct prb_reserved_entry e;
struct printk_record r;
char *p;

prb_rec_init_wr(&r, text_len, process_sz + subsystem_sz + device_sz);
prb_reserve(&e, prb, &r);

memcpy(r.text_buf, text, text_len);
r.info->text_len = text_len;

/* guaranteed ext data */
r.ext_info->ts_boot = time_boot();
r.ext_info->ts_real = time_real();

/* optional ext data */
if (r.dict_buf) {
    p = r.dict_buf;

    memcpy(p, process, process_sz);
    r.ext_info->process = p;
    p += process_sz;
    
    memcpy(p, subsystem, subsystem_sz);
    r.ext_info->subsystem = p;    
    p += subsystem_sz;
    
    memcpy(p, device, device_sz);
    r.ext_info->device = p;

    r.info->dict_len = process_sz + subsystem_sz + device_sz;
}

In that case, perhaps @subsystem should be a static array in
printk_ext_info instead.

The whole point of the dict_ring is that it allows for variable length
_optional_ data to be stored. If we decide there is no optional data,
then dict_ring is not needed.

Agreed. For non-optional data (such as your timestamps), I am in full
agreement that a fixed array is the way to go. And it would only require
a couple lines of code added to the ringbuffer.

My concern is if we need to guarantee space for all possible dictionary
data of all records. I think the dict_ring can be very helpful here.
