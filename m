No, they don't.  They just want to run as fast as possible ;-)

The problem with a MAP_GOES_FASTER flag is that everybody sets it.
Any flag name needs to convey its drawbacks as well as its advantages.
Maybe MAP_EXTREMELY_COARSE_WORKINGSET would do that -- the VM will work
in terms of 1GB pages for this mapping, so any swap-out is going to take
out an entire 1GB at once.

But here's the thing ... we already allow
	mmap(MAP_POPULATE | MAP_HUGETLB | MAP_HUGE_1GB)

So if we're not doing THP, what's the point of this thread?
My understanding of THP is "Application doesn't need to change, kernel
makes a decision about what page size is best based on entire system
state and process's behaviour".

An madvise flag is a different beast; that's just letting the kernel
know what the app thinks its behaviour will be.  The kernel can pay
as much (or as little) attention to that hint as it sees fit.  And of
course, it can change over time (either by kernel release as we change
the algorithms, or simple from one minute to the next as more or less
memory comes available).
