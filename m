Hi,

Maybe you could split the meaning of --subjective and --strict, and
enable those checks only for --subjective? The test is really hard to do
right: you would have to consider the context and not only mere occurrence
of a word (heh, I even wrote 'blacklisted' here, since it really is about
a night/danger analogy and not political/ethical one).

Best Regards,
Micha³ Miros³aw
