Hi Mel,

we have tried the kernel with adjust_numa_imbalance() crippled to just
return the imbalance it's given.

It has solved all the performance problems I have reported.
Performance is the same as with 5.6 kernel (before the patch was
applied).

* solved the performance drop upto 20%  with single instance
SPECjbb2005 benchmark on 8 NUMA node servers (particularly on AMD EPYC
Rome systems) => this performance drop was INCREASING with higher
threads counts (10% for 16 threads and 20 % for 32 threads)
* solved the performance drop for low load scenarios (SPECjvm2008 and NAS)

Any suggestions on how to proceed? One approach is to turn
"imbalance_min" into the kernel tunable. Any other ideas?

Thanks a lot!
Jirka
