Any user, even average, has to deal also with non-debug messages that
do not include this extra information. Why pr_debug() message would
need it?

Message should be useful on its own. The location can be found by
grepping like for any other printk() messages.

Yes, the information might be handy. But all these configuration
choices also make the interface and code complicated. IMHO, it has
been over engineered. And this patch makes it even worse.


Anyway, you answered why the flags are there. But you did not explain
why anyone would need to use a filter based on them. Answer this,
please!!!

No, they were added by the commit 8ba6ebf583f12da32036fc0 ("Dynamic debug:
Add more flags").

There is no explanation why they were added. It probably just looked
like a good idea to the author and nobody complained at that time.

It has been included wihtout any comment, see

The question is not if I could do so. The question is how many users
do it or need to do so.

Features in this patchset affect the interface with userspace. It
means that they would need to be maintained "forewer". For this,
you need to prove that it is widely useful. Ideally, it should
be outcome of some discussion where people missed this.

I do not see any reasonable usecase for anything like:

   echo 'ft+p; mt+p; lt+p;' >control

Why people would do this, please?

Best Regards,
Petr
