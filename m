So, as Guenter pointed I dropped this patch now.

Right, that's interesting, and I'll take in consideration for future reworks of
the above patch and also take a deeper look at those specific cases reported.

BTW, Guillaume, I queued that patch to give a try and test 3 days ago. Is the
bisection job expected to take that time to run? In this case I think it also
took some time to receive the build test, so probably is just a matter of having
lot of jobs in the queue?

I am not complaining at all, just curious, and just want to know to improve my
maintainer workflow.

Thanks,
