Ok, I assume you mean that each thread should use
deferred_init_mem_pfn_range_in_zone.  Yes, that's what I meant when saying that
function could be generalized, though not sure we should opt for this.

Ok, I follow you.  My assumption is that there are generally few free pfn
ranges relative to the total number of pfns being initialized so that it's
efficient to parallelize over a single pfn range from the zone iterator.  On
the systems I tested, there were about 20 tiny ranges and one enormous range
per node so that firing off a job per range kept things simple without
affecting performance.  If that assumption holds, I'm not sure it's worth it to
merge ranges.

With the series as it stands plus leaving in the section alignment check in
deferred_grow_zone (which I think could be relaxed to a maxorder alignment
check) so it doesn't stop mid-max-order-block, threads simply deal with a
start/end range and deferred_init_maxorder becomes shorter and simpler too.
