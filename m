The information is of course as essential as for audit messages.
I dont see much of the problem with having as the first suggestion with
a list. It works fine for trace_pipe. It is not failing due to that we can not
filter with that. It is cause in other tools in user-space
that needs a plugin to parse it. It need static
mapping for something that is not really static. Not in runtime, and it will
change over time.

A other idea based on the first one is to have multiple pairs like

class=file permission=read permission=write permission=open

but then you need to filter on numeric values that are not static and
I don't know if library can make anything useful from that.

I don't see why it should be a issue with a event for each denial, all
of the trace system is opt-in. It is usually only a NOP instruction,
but here  it is a conditional branch and it is in the end of long
process where of a very tiny percent a ending up as denial.

From my view it is more annoying that we do similar things for
audit_log but not equal enough to be shared.
