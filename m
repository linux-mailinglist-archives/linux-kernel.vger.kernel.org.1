Perhaps I misunderstood what commit 32fe905c17f001 ("ubifs: Fix 
O_TMPFILE corner case in ubifs_link()") wanted to fix.
I think orphan area is used to remind filesystem don't forget to delete 
inodes (whose nlink is 0) in next unclean rebooting. Generally, the file 
system is not corrupted caused by replaying orphan nodes.
Ralph reported a filesystem corruption in combination with overlayfs. 
Can you tell me the details about that problem? Thanks.
