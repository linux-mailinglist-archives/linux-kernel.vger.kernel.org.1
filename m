Unlike the new compat macros i.e COMPAT_KERNEL_HWCAP[2] in this patch,
KERNEL_HWCAP_XXX macros are already defined and are getting used else
where (arch/arm64/kernel/cpufeature.c) as well. [KERNEL_HWCAP_##c] can
only be used here, if the input string is in upper case. Otherwise all
these existing macros need to be changed first, which will result in
too much code churn.
