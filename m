All fence instructions are rejected to probe in the current patchset.
ref arch/riscv/kernel/probes/decode-insn.c:
        /*
         * Reject instructions list:
         */
        RISCV_INSN_REJECTED(system,             insn);
        RISCV_INSN_REJECTED(fence,              insn);

All AMO instructions could be single-step emulated.

Yes, the probe between LR/SC will cause dead loop risk and arm64 just
prevent exclusive instructions to probe without the middle detecting.
The macros wrapper idea seems good, but I prefer to leave it to user caring=
.

Yes, I let all AMO & LR/SC could be executed out of line with a
single-step style.
I'll add a comment about LR/SC wrapper macros' idea which you mentioned.

I just use k/uprobe state check function in ebreak handler, no
additional csr tested.
asmlinkage __visible void do_trap_break(struct pt_regs *regs)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_KPROBES
        if (kprobe_single_step_handler(regs))
                return;

        if (kprobe_breakpoint_handler(regs))
                return;
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_UPROBES
        if (uprobe_single_step_handler(regs))
                return;

        if (uprobe_breakpoint_handler(regs))
                return;
#endif
        current->thread.bad_cause =3D regs->cause;

Seems it works good.

Do you prefer to add a single-step mechanism into a privileged-spec?
