There may be low-end SKUs of a model that don't have all the features of
the high-end SKUs. So yes, you may find that a specific SKU of a model
on the list for a feature doesn't have the feature.

A model specific feature may also have implementation differences
on different models.  E.g. if Intel were to produce a model that
did split lock "right" (with thread-scoped control). That would
still use the same bit in IA32_CORE_CAPABILITIES, but the OS would
need model specific knowledge to know that this split lock detect
worked differently from another model that has split lock detect.
