Its more like "educated" luck. If we assign the domains in the right order we
know that the GPU will be on context bank 0 but you are entirely right that if
everything doesn't go exactly the way we need things go badly.

Some targets do have the ability to reprogram which context bank is used but
that would require a domain attribute from the SMMU driver to communicate that
information back to the GPU driver.

That seems like a reasonable option. That seems like it would work with legacy
targets and rely less on luck.
