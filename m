We have PAGE_SIZE / sizeof(void *). The above ASCI was an example :)

Answering the second question about fixed number of preloaded pages. Please see
some concerns:

- It is hard to achieve because the logic does not stick to certain static test
  case, i.e. it depends on how heavily kfree_rcu(single/double) are used. Based
  on that, "how heavily" - number of pages are formed, until the drain/reclaimer
  thread frees them.

- Preloading pages and keeping them for internal use, IMHO, seems not optimal
  from the point of resources wasting. It is better to have a fast mechanism to
  request a page and release it back for needs of others. As described about
  we do not know how much we will need.

- As for fallback. That is something we would like to avoid(please see the cover letter).
  Just mention here one concern. For single argument it an entrance to synchronize_rcu()
  that can significantly slow down the reclamation process. What actually we would like
  to speed up.

Thanks. I will have a look at it :) it is good that we can control it!

I was talking about: how to bypass waking up of the kswapd that uses
sleepable lock. So, __get_free_page(0) will give a trick. But of course
that is not enough. Because we have prefeatchin pcpl-logic also.

No, i do not want to break GFP_NOWAIT, as Matthew mentioned later :)
__GFP_NO_LOCKS looks nice. I think, something like "TRY" should be added as well.
For example __GFP_NO_LOCKS_FAST_TRY.

I am glad for the reaction on it :)

Thank you, Vlastimil!
