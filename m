Sure. Do we want memory.high a CFTYPE_NS_DELEGATABLE type file? I
don't think so otherwise any job on a system can change their
memory.high and can adversely impact the isolation and memory
scheduling of the system.

Next we have to agree that there are valid use-cases to allow
applications to reclaim from their cgroups and I think uswapd and
proactive reclaim are valid use-cases. Let's suppose memory.high is
the only way to trigger reclaim but the application can not write to
their top level memory.high, so, it has to create a dummy cgroup of
which it has write access to memory.high and has to move itself to
that dummy cgroup to use memory.high to trigger reclaim for
uswapd/proactive-reclaim.
