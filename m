Mainly to follow coding style if you look at:

static void __put_seccomp_filter(struct seccomp_filter *orig)
{
	/* Clean up single-reference branches iteratively. */
	while (orig && refcount_dec_and_test(&orig->usage)) {
		struct seccomp_filter *freeme = orig;
		orig = orig->prev;
		seccomp_filter_free(freeme);
	}
}

seemed easier to just have a visual correspondence between those two
codepaths.

I think requiring users to import
golang.org/x/sys/unix
is reasonable. You'll need to special case this to linux builds anyway
even if you have a client or some such that build on on-unixes. And even
if you don't want to import there's always the possibility to use cgo. :)

I'm confused how you want to plumb this into the ioctl. That seems
unpleasant and against usual poll/wait semantics. I'm now also wondering
how you're using this whole interface without poll. The idea is to wait
until you're notified you can receive.

Cool.
