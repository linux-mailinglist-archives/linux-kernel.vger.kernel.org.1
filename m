Strictly speaking, smp_mb__after_atomic() works only in combination
with a non-value-returning atomic operation. Let's look at a (silly)
example where smp_mb__after_atomic() would not help in conjunction
with smp_store_release():

void thread1(void)
{
	smp_store_release(&x, 1);
	smp_mb__after_atomic();
	r1 = READ_ONCE(y);
}

void thread2(void)
{
	smp_store_release(&y, 1);
	smp_mb__after_atomic();
	r2 = READ_ONCE(x);
}

Even on x86 (or perhaps especially on x86) it is quite possible that
execution could end with r1 == r2 == 0 because on x86 there is no
ordering whatsoever from smp_mb__after_atomic().  In this case,
the CPU is well within its rights to reorder each thread's store
with its later load.  Yes, even x86.

On the other hand, suppose that the stores are non-value-returning
atomics:

void thread1(void)
{
	atomic_inc(&x);
	smp_mb__after_atomic();
	r1 = READ_ONCE(y);
}

void thread2(void)
{
	atomic_inc(&y);
	smp_mb__after_atomic();
	r2 = READ_ONCE(x);
}

In this case, for all architectures, there would be the equivalent
of an smp_mb() full barrier associated with either the atomic_inc()
or the smp_mb__after_atomic(), which would rule out the case where
execution ends with r1 == r2 == 0.

Does that help?

							Thanx, Paul
