In some cases we may not even want to have a VM exit: think
e.g. real-time/partitioning case when even in case of bus lock we may
not want to add additional latency just to count such events. I'd
suggest we make the new capability tri-state:
- disabled (no vmexit, default)
- stats only (what this patch does)
- userspace exit
But maybe this is an overkill, I'd like to hear what others think.

This is likely the easiest solution.
