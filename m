There are non-ACPI SoundWire systems - Qualcomm have some systems
upstream.

Like I say the abstraction is generally just setting up the very basic
stuff and calling into a common init function with a few parameters.

The stuff that's upstream for DT platforms is for Qualcomm systems where
the reference designs are generally fully integrated with Qualcomm
components so there's limited overlap.  IIRC they also have a fairly
unusual system design with a mix of SoundWire and Slimbus usually (that
was the case for a while at least).
