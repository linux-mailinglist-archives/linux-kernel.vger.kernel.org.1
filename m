Thanks for taking a look. I am glad it seems okay, I have run several tests
and was unable to have it fail (so far) while previous versions were easily
breakable.

Yeah, this a kind of PTI on steroid as part of the implementation was done
based on the PTI implementation but making it more generic. The test driver
has proven very useful for testing and debugging. I am currently using it
(with some extensions) for helping me define the KVM ASI: I can connect the
driver to a KVM ASI, dump the KVM ASI faults and dynamically add mappings;
this is very handy.

I am also concerned about making changes in all these nasty corners. I am a
bit more confident now that it is working to implement PTI because PTI provides
a good stress test for ASI. I am also waiting for (and reviewing) all x86/entry
changes from tglx; this greatly cleans up the entry code and will hopefully help
for the integration of ASI. I will rebase as soon as these all changes are
integrated and check the benefit for ASI.

I am working on defining ASI for KVM. Hopefully this will provide a good
usage example, and make the changes more compelling.

Thanks.
