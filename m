The NOP is the same as a regular function call but the CALL
instruction is replaced with a NOP instruction. The code that sets up
the call parameters is unchanged, and so is the code that expects to
get the return value in eax or whatever. That means we cannot actually
call the static_calls for NULL slots, we'd get undefined behaviour
(except for void hooks) - this is what Peter is talking about in the
sibling thread.

For this reason, there are _no gaps_ in the callback table. For a
given LSM hook, all the slots after base_slot_idx are filled, and all
before are empty, so jumping to base_slot_idx ensures that we don't
reach an empty slot. That's what the switch trick is all about.

Yeah that's a good question - but the existing behaviour is to always
check against 0 (DEFAULT_RET is called IRC in the real code),
which does seem strange.

> So what goes in for empty slots? What about gaps in the table?

It's a NOP, but we never execute it (explained above). There are no gaps.

It's just an arbitrary limit on the unrolling macro implementation, we
aren't actually unrolling beyond 11 where the macro is used (N is set
to 11).

Yeah, that's exactly what we need but it needs to be expanded to an
integer literal at preprocessor time, those +s won't work :(

Yeah that's a good question. As I said in the sibling thread the
motivating example is very lightweight LSM callbacks in very hot
codepaths, but I'll get some broader data too and report back.
