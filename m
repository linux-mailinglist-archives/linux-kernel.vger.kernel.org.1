I would expect we'd want a fairly tight coupling between kernel
releases and minimum rust releases at first. Whatever is the latest
stable rust version during the kernel's merge window might be
assumed to be the minimum version for the life of that kernel, but
an LTS release would not suddenly start relying on features
from a newer compiler (thought it might warn about known bugs).

This might mean that linux-next requires a beta version of rust, if
the release is expected before the merge window and it contains
an important change. Staying with fairly recent versions of clang
certainly helped in getting clang and the kernel to co-evolve and
get to the point we are now in using it as an alternative to gcc.

While Linux used to build with 12 year old compilers (4.1 until
2018), we now require a 6 year old gcc (4.9) or 1 year old
clang/llvm. I don't know whether these will fully converge over
time but it seems sensible that the minimum rust frontend version
we require for a new kernel release would eventually also fall
in that range, requiring a compiler that is no more than a few
years old, but not requiring the latest stable release.
