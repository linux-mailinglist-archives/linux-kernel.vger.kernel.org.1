Yes, indeed we do. Like it or not, kexec is a thing, and about 98% of 
drivers will have been written without considering it.

If fixing one problem exposes lots of other problems, can you honestly 
say that the best solution is to go back and re-break the original thing?

The point is that kexec needs to return the system to a state as close 
to reset as possible. The SMMU is at least as relevant as any other 
device in that regard, if not far more so - consider if the first kernel 
*did* leave it enabled with whatever left-over translations in place, 
and kexec'ed into another OS that wasn't SMMU-aware...

Yes. And if you really want to argue against that, then at least be 
consistent and propose removing shutdown from *all* the IOMMU drivers. 
And then probably propose removing kexec support from all their 
respective architectures... ;)
