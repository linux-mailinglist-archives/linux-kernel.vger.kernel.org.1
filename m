Hi Naoya,

Thanks for dusting this off.
To be honest, I got stuck with the hard offline mode so this delayed
the resubmission, along other problems.

I fully agree.

My "new" version included a patch to make sure we give a chance to
pages that possibly are in a pcplist.
Current behavior is that if someone tries to soft-offline such a page,
we return an error because page count is 0 but page is not in the buddy
system.

Since this patchset already landed in the mm tree, I could send it as a
standalone patch on top if you agree with it.

My patch looked something like:

Subject: [PATCH] mm,hwpoison: Drain pcplists before bailing out for
non-buddy
 zero-refcount page

A page with 0-refcount and !PageBuddy could perfectly be a pcppage.
Currently, we bail out with an error if we encounter such a page,
meaning that we do not give a chance to handle pcppages.

Fix this by draining pcplists whenever we find this kind of page
and retry the check again.
It might be that pcplists have been spilled into the buddy allocator
and so we can handle it.
