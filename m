That's a really good question for which I think the answer is something
close to: "that's impossible to predict". I could try some in-house (at
redhat) automated tests to see if something break, but I doubt it is
enough to catch any breakage.

Yes, no doubt it's better!

Agreed.

I'm going to prepare a v2 of the patch adding the comments.

Thanks Petr!
