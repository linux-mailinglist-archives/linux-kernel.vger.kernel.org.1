Honestly, I do not have experience with changing the defaults. People
hacking small devices might complain. Well, this can be solved
by increasing the default only when BASE_FULL is set.

I am personally fine with increasing the default when BASE_FULL
is set. The amount of messages is growing over time because of
increasing complexity of both the hardware and software.
Fortunately also the amount of available memory is growing.

Well, this should get discussed in wider audience. Adding some
people into CC.

JFYI, it started with report of lost messages, see
