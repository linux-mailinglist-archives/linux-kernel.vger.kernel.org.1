I meant SYSEMU versus SYSCALL + cancellation and emulating the syscall
at the syscall exit stop.

i.e., I was trying to understand whether SYSEMU is just a convenience,
or does some magic that can't be reproduced by other means.

I think NT_PRSTATUS probably doesn't need to change.

Having a duplicate regset feels like a worse outcome that having a new
ptrace option.  Undocumentedly different things already happen to the
regs depending on how the tracee stopped, so adding a new special case
doesn't seem to justify creating a new regset.
