Thank you for the review and comments!

Andrew pushed this to an upstream maintainer, but I have not seen these
patches appear anywhere.  So if that upstream maintainer was Linus, I can
send a follow-up patch once we converge.  If the upstream maintainer was
in fact me, I can of course update the commit directly.  If the upstream
maintainer was someone else, please let me know who it is.  ;-)

(Linus does not appear to have pushed anything out since before Andrew's
email, hence my uncertainty.)

I examined other code to obtain this.  I have been assuming that the
point was to be able to handle multipage slabs, but I freely confess to
having no idea.  But I am reluctant to change this sequence unless the
other code translating from pointer to in-slab object is also changed.

Like this, just before the "objp =" statement?

	WARN_ON_ONCE(objnr >= cachep->num);

Doesn't the "WARN_ON_ONCE(objp < base" further down report underflows?
Or am I missing something subtle here?
