Hi Sandy,

I actually have worked quite a bit with IPsec, it's not a protocol I'm
a huge fan of, it's use of multiple ports make it difficult to work
with middleboxs (be it load-balancers, TLS interceptors, reverse
proxies, proxies, firewalls, routers, switches, etc.). I've even seen
issues where some middleboxes only recognize TCP/UDP packets and not
ESP packets. There's so many implementations of IPsec with various
routers OS's and the standard seems to be only sort of universally
accepted. It can be difficult to deploy.

Although Wireshark does solve at many of these problems, it's simpler
at least, as regards VPNs I really like it. I'm actually more a fan of
protocols that applications have a little more control over like QUIC
over UDP or TLS over TCP.

I actually use HTTPS Everywhere plugin, but at the end of the day,
that simply just turns on TLS encryption if it's available right?

I like some of the problems QUIC solves, the multiple handshake
problem decreasing overall round trips, and just that it's more
modern. openssl is brilliant, but there's a lot of deadwood, older
encryption techniques in that codebase.

A monolithic secure TCP protocol seems like a nice idea, but maybe it
is too difficult.

I think it's a nice idea to explore OOM killer and compare it to the
solutions on various other OS's (FreeBSD, AIX, z/OS, Solaris, HP-UX,
macOS, iOS, Windows, Zircon, etc. and the OS I work on Powermax).
Thanks for that.

Any other ideas, keep them coming :)
