Barry must have missed this email.  He reported the issue so I was hoping
he would reply.

Based on the code changes, I believe the following could happen:
- Someone uses 'hugetlb_cma=' kernel command line parameter to reserve
  CMA for gigantic pages.
- The system topology is such that no memory is on node 0.  Therefore,
  no CMA can be reserved for gigantic pages on node 0.  CMA is reserved
  on other nodes.
- The user also specifies a number of gigantic pages to pre-allocate on
  the command line with hugepagesz=<gigantic_page_size> hugepages=<N>
- The routine which allocates gigantic pages from the bootmem allocator
  will not detect CMA has been reserved as there is no memory on node 0.
  Therefore, pages will be pre-allocated from bootmem allocator as well
  as reserved in CMA.

This double allocation (bootmem and CMA) is the worst case scenario.  Not
sure if this is what Barry saw, and I suspect this would rarely happen.

After writing this, I started to think that perhaps command line parsing
should be changed.  If hugetlb_cma= is specified, it makes no sense to
pre-allocate gigantic pages.  Therefore, the hugepages=<N> paramemter
should be ignored and flagged with a warning if  hugetlb_cma= is specified.
This could be checked at parsing time and there would be no need for such
a check in the allocation code (except for sanity cheching).

Thoughts?  I just cleaned up the parsing code and could make such a change
quite easily.
