I don't know whether the use case is important or not.  Usually the
performance of swapoff doesn't matter.  Maybe you can provide some
information on this.

Even if it's important, I don't think we really need to add another ABI.
You can just optimize the swapoff performance inside kernel.  And we may
not even need to add a new policy, just use cluster readahead and
increase swapin_readahead_hits in swapoff if cluster readahead is used.

Huang, Ying
