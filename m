Because you have to support no compatible (forever), there's no point 
adding this compatible.

This violates having multiple nodes at the same address because you are 
independently overlaying partitions and nvmem cells on same address 
ranges. It also seems seems pretty fragile if you want to update 
partitions.

I think instead, nvmem cells should be contained within a partition. 
The partition should then have a compatible to indicate it contains 
nvmem cells.
