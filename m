Unrestricted code execution even before loaded? Unrestricted by

They can restrict what is started and loaded before anything SGX
happens.

If you want to make real technical arguments then please be specific and
precise and spare us the handwaving marketing speak.

The diffstat of your patch is irrelevant. What's relevant is the fact
that it is completely unreviewed and that it creates yet another user
space visible ABI with a noticable lack of documentation.

And that's a problem because?

What's wrong with having IOCTL_INIT_TYPE_A and IOCTL_INIT_TYPE_B?

Nothing at all. It's pretty straight forward and in fact a better
solution than a duct taped multiplexing all in one IOCTL_INIT_PONIES
approach.

You're surely making a convincing technical argument by claiming that
this was a political decision. The amount of non-technical, i.e.
political arguments in your mail is definitely larger than the technical
content.

It's an approach which guarantees that the driver will miss the next
merge window. If that's your intention, then please let us know.

Merging the current set of patches does not prevent anything you want to
be added. It's an extension to the base implementation and not a
prerequisite.

Thanks a lot for the best wishes. Unfortunately reading this email was
not necessarily productive for me, but I surely wish that you can make
productive use of my reply.

Thanks,
