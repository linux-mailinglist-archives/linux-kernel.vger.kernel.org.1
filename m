Most simple form of the altermative solution would be doing offline data access
pattern profiling using DAMON and modifying the application source code or
system configuration based on the profiling results.

More automated alternative solution would be a daemon constructed with two
modules:

 - monitor: monitors the data access pattern of the workload via the DAMON
   debugfs interface
 - memory manager: based on the monitoring result, make appropriate memory
   management changes via mlock(), madvise(), sysctl, etc.

The daemon would be able to run inside the application process as a thread, or
outside as a standalone process.  If the daemon could not run inside the
application process, the memory management changes it could make would be
further limited, though, as mlock() and madvise() would not be available.  The
madvise_process(), which is already merged in the next tree, would be helpful
in this case.

Only monitoring target processes will be applied.  The monitoring target
processes can be specified by writing the process ids to 'pids' debugfs file or
constructing the 'struct damon_ctx' via the programming interface.

I will refine the commit message to make the points clearer, in the next spin.
