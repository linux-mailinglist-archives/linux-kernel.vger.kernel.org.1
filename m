Indeed, and I'm a bit disappointed at the willingness to leave stuff
by the wayside, especially since Clang's integrated assembler has no
other benefit to it than being built into the compiler.

Fair enough.

The following set of macros appears to emit the opcodes correctly,
assuming we're willing to tweak the source code somewhat, i.e., drop
square brackets and leading # for immediate offsets. (The tmcr/tmrc
instructions are left as an exercise for the reader)
