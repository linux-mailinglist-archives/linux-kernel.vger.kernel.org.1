Not really, just haven't got around to looking into it. Mark Rutland
raised a concern (in private) about the safety of multithreaded apps
but I think you already replied that timens_install() checks for this
already [1].

Maybe a similar atomicity issue to the one raised by Mark but for
single-threaded processes: the thread is executing vdso code, gets
interrupted and a signal handler invokes setns(). Would resuming the
execution in the vdso code on sigreturn cause any issues?
