Users of devices with cloned ids come to us asking why their devices do
not work on Linux and how to fix them.  Happens all the time, and as the
job of a kernel is to enable hardware, we work to make this happen.

The vendors who do this are no where to be found, of course, and telling
people that the device they just purchased is "counterfit" doesn't
really fall in our job description.  We have all sorts of work-arounds
in Linux drivers to support "fake" devices, our job is to make Linux
work for everyone.

Anyway, this is far off-topic for this thread, sorry, just letting you
know why trying to rely on vid/pid is not the "final solution" people
might think it is.

I wish someone else would have weighed in on the different api options
here, oh well, let me think about this over the next week or so...

thanks,
