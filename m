Do you mean expliciting that with a comment, right ? being the last member 'payld'
a flexible array must be the last in order to even compile.

I'm a bit confused anyway on how the trailing padding works on a struct like
this which ends with a flexible array definition, so I was expecting that the
trailing pads would have made no difference, given that it's used to basically
give some know layout to a blob of data via casting...

Thanks
