Yes, it works, although the PHY is hardcoded to CC2 orientation and 4 
lanes, SS PHY disabled, and hotplugging/TCPM doesn't work in all cases.

The solution could be that the DP PHY has priority over the SS PHY. If 
the DP PHY is enabled with 4 lanes then it should go into DP_MODE, 1-2 
lanes it goes into concurrent mode, and USB3_MODE if disabled. The 
problem then is that the SS PHY can't be enabled while the DP PHY is 
enabled (since it will be clock gated), so enabling the SS PHY needs to 
be deferred to when the DP PHY is disabled. I think that is reasonable?

Note I have a TCPM (typec + USB PD) driver [1] which is required to 
negotiate the DP altmode (and provides altmode events to the DP driver 
so it can enable/disable the PHY). My problem is the qcom PMIC doesn't 
provide exactly what TCPM wants, and I don't have access to PMIC 
documentation, so its difficult for me to make a fully working TCPM 
driver. Also conflicts with [2] since both drivers use the typec PMIC 
block...
