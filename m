Fine by me. I'll continue to maintain the in-kernel SPE driver, but I'd love
to see somebody step up to looking after the userspace code. It's seriously
unloved on arm64 :(

I'd even be happy to see one or two M: entries added for
tools/perf/pmu-events/arch/arm64/. I realistically don't have the time to
take that on, but I'd be thrilled if any/all of John, Mathieu and Leo were
to be listed there if they are willing to do so and can spare the time to
look after it. Even just silly things like making sure the thing
cross-compiles have been broken in the recent past, so it's not necessarily
about handling huge amounts of incoming patches.

In other words, rather than slice up the arm64 parts of the perf tool, I'd
argue in favour of a joint maintainership model for all the arm64 bits, if
we have a few willing volunteers.

Will
