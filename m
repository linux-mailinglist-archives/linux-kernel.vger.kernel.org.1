Part of the patch from Sai, fixes this by avoiding the dereferencing
after event creation (by caching it). But the kernel events needs
fixing.

One follow up question on the !->owner issue. Given the ->owner is
dying, does it prevent events from being scheduled ? Or is there a delay
between that and eventually stopping the events. In this case, we hit
the issue when :

A					  A or B ?

event_start()
   ...					event->owner = NULL

  READ_ONCE(event->owner);

Is this expected ?

Correct, kernel events are something that the driver didn't account for.
May be we could handle this case with a "special pid" and simply
disallow sharing (which is fine I believe, given there are not grouping
for the kernel created events).
