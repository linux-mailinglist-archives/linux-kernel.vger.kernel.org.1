I'm assuming this patch is related to [0]. If all you want is to address 
memory above 16M, why not switch to 4-byte addressing mode instead? 
Taking a quick look at the datasheet tells me this can be done via the 
"Enter 4-byte address mode" command (0xB7). Then just use the regular 
read/program commands with 4-byte addresses. Does that work for you? Is 
there any reason you _have_ to use dedicated 4B opcodes?
