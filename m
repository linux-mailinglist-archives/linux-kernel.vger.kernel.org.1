Well, I don't want to hold up progress. If it's not very convincing to you,
let's just drop the idea/ It was kind of weak. :)

Yes you are right, of course. And I even worked through that, but then
when I sat down to write a response my fingers typed v1 of my understanding
instead of v2. No one knows why. :) Sorry about the misinformation there.

Not worth worrying about, but I do recall a few recent code reviews that
all preferred the multi-line version, which is why I suggested it.

Anyway, either way, with the thp_pmd_migration_success() name change, you
can add:
