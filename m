Yes.  And things work fine if I try 4e2f62e566b5.

The problem is it's a bit tricky to revert 568f27006577, since there
is a merge conflict in blk_kick_flush().  I attempted to do the bisect
manually here, but it's clearly not right since the kernel is not
booting after the revert:

https://github.com/tytso/ext4/commit/1e67516382a33da2c9d483b860ac4ec2ad390870

branch:

https://github.com/tytso/ext4/tree/manual-revert-of-568f27006577

Can you send me a patch which correctly reverts 568f27006577?  I can
try it against -rc1 .. -rc4, whichever is most convenient.

It's a variety of mount command lines, since I'm using gce-xfstests[1][2]
using a variety of file system scenarios --- but the basic one, which
is ext4 using the default 4k block size is failing (they all are failing).

[1] https://thunk.org/gce-xfstests
[2] https://github.com/tytso/xfstests-bld/blob/master/Documentation/gce-xfstests.md

It's also not one consistent xfstests which is failing, but it does
tend to be tests which are loading up the storage stack with a lot of
small random read/writes, especially involving metadata blocks/writes.
(For example, tests which run fsstress.)

Since this reliably triggers for me, and other people running
kvm-xfstests or are running xfstests on their own test environments
aren't seeing it, I'm assuming it must be some kind of interesting
interaction between virtio-scsi, perhaps with how Google Persistent
Disk is behaving (maybe timing related?  who knows?).  Darrick Wong
did say he saw something like it once using Oracle's Cloud
infrastructure, but as far as I know it hasn't reproduced since.  On
Google Compute Engine VM's, it reproduces *extremely* reliably.

I expect that if you were to set up gce-xfstests, get a free GCE
account with the initial $300 free credits, you could run
"gce-xfstests -c ext4/4k -g auto" and it would reproduce within an
hour or so.  (So under a dollar's worth of VM credits, so long as you
notice that it's hung and shut down the VM after gathering debugging
data.)

P.S.  As you can see, I can also easily run blktests using this VM
Test Appliance.  If you think it would be helpful for me to try
running one or more of the blktests test groups, I can do that.

I've been focusing on using xfstests mainly because this is my primary
way of running regression tests, and I'm blocked on ext4 testing until
I can figure out this particular problem.  Which is why a proper
revert of 568f27006577 would be extremely helpful, if only so I can
apply that on top of the ext4 git tree temporarily so I can run my
file system regression tests.
