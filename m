I'm not sure I get your point.
For the PERF_SAMPLE_READ with PERF_FORMAT_GROUP case, other events can 
be the leader, e.g., {cycles, slots, metric-things}:S.
In this case, the SLOTS event is not a leader. I don't think we can 
assume that the SLOTS event must be the leader.

I think the case should be a useful case. Users may want to read the 
Topdown values for each sample.

Thanks,
Kan
