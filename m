The rules around dma-fence are ridiculously strict, and it only makes
sense to inflict that upon you if you actually want to participate in
the cross driver uapi built up around dma-buf and dma-fence.

I've recently started some lockdep annotations to better enforce these
rules (and document them), and it's finding tons of subtle bugs even
in drivers/gpu (and I only just started with annotating drivers:

https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/20200707201229.472834-1-daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch/

You really don't want to deal with this if you don't have to. If
drivers/gpu folks (who created this) aren't good enough to understand
it, maybe it's not a good idea to sprinkle this all over the tree. And
fundamentally all this is is a slightly fancier struct completion. Use
that one instead, or a wait_queue.

I discussed this a bit with Oded, and he thinks it's easier to
copypaste and simplify, but given that all other drivers seem to get
by perfectly well with completion or wait_queue, I'm not sure that's a
solid case.

Also adding Jason Gunthorpe, who very much suggested this should be
limited to dma-buf/gpu related usage only.

> Copying code leads to errors, here's some documentation ones:

Yeah except here reusing code without understanding what it does and
how it should be used leads to error :-) At least given by the
drivers/gpu track record, I'm pretty sure sprinkling my new dma_fence
lockdep annotations would lead to lots of splats.

Cheers, Daniel
