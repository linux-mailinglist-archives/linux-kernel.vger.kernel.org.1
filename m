Ok. Issue is that the controller is initialized when 
stm32_fmc2_nfc_select_chip is called. This function will be called 
before the ->attach() hook, when the first command will be sent to the 
NAND device (reset command). So, moving the default ECC initialization
needs probably more modifications in the driver.
I will try to send a v2 today.
