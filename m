Based on the feedback, I have 3 TODO items:

- track down and eliminate (or explain) the source of the .got.plt on arm64
- enable orphan warnings for _all_ architectures
- refactor final link logic to perform the orphan warning in a clean way

I'm working through these (and other work) still. I'm hoping to have
another version up some time next week.
