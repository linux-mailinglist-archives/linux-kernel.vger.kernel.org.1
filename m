Can you elaborate more ??

Is the SBI call for 2) needed to enable/disable counters in MCOUNTEREN CSR ?

Currently, OpenSBI enables all counters by default but I see the need
to enable/disable HPMCOUNTER on-demand from perf event start/stop.

I hope we don't need any other implementation specific CSR to be programmed
for enabling/disabling counters on SiFive Unleashed ??
