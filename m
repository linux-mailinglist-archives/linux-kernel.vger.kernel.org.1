Ouch. With the __{READ,WRITE}_ONCE requirement, we're going to need
Clang 11 though.

Because without the data_race() around __*_ONCE,
arch_atomic_{read,set} will be broken for KCSAN, but we can't have
data_race() because it would still add
kcsan_{enable,disable}_current() calls to __no_sanitize functions (if
compilation unit is instrumented). We can't make arch_atomic functions
__no_sanitize_or_inline, because even in code that we want to
sanitize, they should remain __always_inline (so they work properly in
__no_sanitize functions). Therefore, Clang 11 with support for
distinguishing volatiles will be the compiler that will satisfy all
the constraints.

If this is what we want, let me prepare a series on top of
-tip/locking/kcsan with all the things I think we need.

Thanks,
