Assuming 4K pages you need 52 RPN bits to cover the whole 64bit
physical address space. The IODA3 spec does explicitly say the upper
bits are optional and the implementation only needs to support enough
to cover up to the physical address limit, which is 56bits of P9 /
PHB4. If you want to validate that the address will fit inside of
MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS then fine, but I think that should be done as a
WARN_ON or similar rather than just silently masking off the bits.
