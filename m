We asked for numbers several times but so far we got none and some quick
checks I did myself are in the noise.

Who cares, really?

It's pretty irrelevant because the main source of horrors are in having
to run through _ALL_ registered NMI handlers. Why would you worry about
the extra cache miss? It gets worse when the NMI handler needs to access
the NMI cause register and that happens more often than you would expect
in the cases where it matters, e.g. high frequency PERF NMIs, due to the
well designed hardware mechanism.

OTOH, enforcing the writes on every VMENTER/EXIT is insanely expensive
compared to the maybe RDPID advantage.

While my general reasoning is that virtualization causes more problems
than it solves, in this particular case insisting on a few bare metal
cycles in paranoid entry would be beyond hypocritical.

My summary would be less politically correct, so I just join the choir:

   Oh well ...

Thanks,
