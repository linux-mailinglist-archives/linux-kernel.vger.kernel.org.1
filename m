maybe a reader will ask about ENQCMDs after reading ENQCMD/S spec. :-)

> +to work in the same address space. In short, sharing the address space.
> +Some call it Shared Virtual Memory (SVM), but Linux community wanted to

> +* What is a PASID?
> +
> +A Process Address Space ID (PASID) is a PCIe-defined TLP Prefix. A
> +PASID is a 20 bit number allocated and managed by the OS. PASID is
> +included in all transactions between the platform and the device.
> +
> +* How are shared work queues different?
> +
> +Traditionally to allow user space applications interact with hardware,
> +there is a separate instance required per process. For example,
> +consider doorbells as a mechanism of informing hardware about work to
> +process. Each doorbell is required to be spaced 4k (or page-size) apart
> +for process isolation. This requires hardware to provision that space
> +and reserve in MMIO. This doesn't scale as the number of threads
> +becomes quite large. The hardware also manages the queue depth for
> +Shared Work Queues (SWQ), and consumers don't need to track queue
> +depth. If there is no space to accept a command, the device will return
> +an error indicating retry. Also submitting a command to an MMIO address
> +that can't accept ENQCMD will return retry in response. In the new DMWr
> +PCIe terminology, devices need to support DMWr completer capability. In
> +addition it requires all switch ports to support DMWr routing and must
> +be enabled by the PCIe subsystem, much like how PCIe Atomics() are manag=
ed for
> instance.
> +
> +SWQ allows hardware to provision just a single address in the device.
> +When used with ENQCMD to submit work, the device can distinguish the
> +process submitting the work since it will include the PASID assigned to
> +that process. This decreases the pressure of hardware requiring to
> +support hardware to scale to a large number of processes.
> +
> +* Is this the same as a user space device driver?
> +
> +Communicating with the device via the shared work queue is much simpler
> +than a full blown user space driver. The kernel driver does all the
> +initialization of the hardware. User space only needs to worry about
> +submitting work and processing completions.
> +
> +* Is this the same as SR-IOV?
> +
> +Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) focuses on providing
> +independent hardware interfaces for virtualizing hardware. Hence its
> +required to be almost fully functional interface to software supporting
> +the traditional BAR's, space for interrupts via MSI-x, its own register =
layout.
> +Virtual Functions (VFs) are assisted by the Physical Function (PF)
> +driver.
> +
> +Scalable I/O Virtualization builds on the PASID concept to create
> +device instances for virtualization. SIOV requires host software to
> +assist in creating virtual devices, each virtual device is represented
> +by a PASID along with the BDF of the device.  This allows device
> +hardware to optimize device resource creation and can grow dynamically
> +on demand. SR-IOV creation and management is very static in nature.
> +Consult references below for more details.
> +
> +* Why not just create a virtual function for each app?
> +
> +Creating PCIe SRIOV type virtual functions (VF) are expensive. They
> +create duplicated hardware for PCI config space requirements,
> +Interrupts such as MSIx for instance. Resources such as interrupts have
> +to be hard partitioned between VF's at creation time, and cannot scale
> +dynamically on demand. The VF's are not completely independent from the
> +Physical function (PF). Most VF's require some communication and
> +assistance from the PF driver. SIOV creates a software defined device.
> +Where all the configuration and control aspects are mediated via the

> +* Does this support virtualization?
> +
> +ENQCMD can be used from within a guest VM. In these cases the VMM helps
