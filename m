Disabling LLCC is not the suggestion, I was under the impression that
was the cause here for the smmu bug. Anyways, the check for llc slice
in case llcc is disabled is not correct as well. I will send a patch for
that as well.

My mistake, I will move it.

I do not have a list of all A6XX GPUs with me currently, but from what
I know, A618, A630, A640, A650 has the support.
